You may remember a dream as if it had been long when it may have lasted a few seconds.

       " '\\nThe recommendation for time asleep and percentage they are saying like if you fell asleep at 10 and woke at 6 and don’t have any memory of being awake for a prolonged period of time that is an 8 hour sleep. They aren’t deducting micro awake times or 1 to 2 minutes a few times a night.Also if you take the total time slept and recalculate the percentage without the awake percentage: when they refer to needing 13 to 20 percent of deep sleep that’s of your total time asleep. So you would just take the deep or rem time in minutes divided by the total time asleep and the percentage is higher then FITBIT says because they include awake time and micro awake times.Also since FITBIT includes awake times of 30 seconds or so I just change my time asleep goal to 6 hours and 45 minutes which would be more then the minimal 7 hours recommendation if you have only 30 min of fit bit awake time.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nMy fitbit seems to think I get little to no REM or Deep Sleep. Is this happening to anyone else? I have a sleep disorder, but it involves sleeping too much and doesn\\'t result in non REM or Deep Sleep. I just have trouble trusting my results and was wondering whether anyone else had the same feelings.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nModerator edit: subject for clarity \\n\\n\\nYes me! I\\'m often tired and have memory problems and that\\'s why I got a fitbit with a detailed sleep tracker. However I\\'m really alarmed at how little rem and deep sleep I seem to be getting! I\\'ve tried all the sleep hygiene tips I can find on the net, and been following Paul McKenna\\'s book but it\\'s still as bad. I\\'m hoping that the fitbit sleep tracker is inaccurate as I don\\'t know what else I can do. I really don\\'t think I suffer from sleep apnoea. I\\'d love to know others experiences.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHello!\\xa0So getting too little REM sleep can be an area for concern, but so can getting too much. Ideally, you guys have been in a sleep lab and know how much REM you guys are sleeping. Barring that (those things can get quite expensive), if you\\'re reaching about 20-25% REM sleep, that\\'s quite typical (give or take a few percentages to account for variance and the fact that we\\'re all unique).\\xa0When you guys say \"little\" or \"low\" REM sleep, how much are you guys talking about?\\xa0Sources:\\xa0https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleephttps://blog.fitbit.com/sleep-stages-explained/\\xa0The fitbit link is a more simplified version of understanding sleep stages, since Fitbit also simplifies the conception of sleep stages for our Charge 2.\\n\\n\\nHiya, thanks for responding.I sleep about 8 hours (I know, lucky me!) And last night for example I got 1 hour 38 mins rem (16%) and 29 mins deep.Previous night 1hr 15 rem (13%) and 59 mins deep.\\xa0It often doesn\\'t tell me percentages as so low.\\xa0Maybe I wear my tracker too loosley??Thanks!\\n\\n\\nHello again,\\xa016% REM is quite fuzzy, that 13% is markedly low indeed. If you say it often doesn\\'t say percentages are low, I\\'m assuming that getting less REM is recent? If so, how long ago was it saying you were getting more REM? Any changes in your sleep environment/household (like, are people coming in and out like a college dorm or shared apartment, are there moving vehicles/trains/trucks that travel late at night that wake you up sometimes, etc).\\xa0\\xa0Wearing the tracker too loosely can throw off your sleep stage readings; your device may actually revert to the old sleep stages screen if you get poor heart rate monitoring. The issue is, it\\'d be hard to tell where the line is drawn between \"inaccurate sleep stages\" and \"won\\'t measure them at all\" if you\\'re wearing it too loosely. Still, couldn\\'t hurt to tighten it a bit if you can comfortably.\\n\\n\\nHiya, I\\'ve only had the Alta hr for less than a week so don\\'t know if it\\'s a recent problem. I suspect it\\'s long-standing as I\\'m often tired no matter how much sleep I\\'ve had. That\\'s why I got the device with sleep stages.\\xa0I\\'ll try wearing the tracker a bit tighter and lower on my wrist and also hope it\\'s\\u200b just a temporary issue. I need to give it longer I guess.Thanks again.Ruth\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0Like negligible deep sleep. Which is funny because I think my sleep disorder typically results in much MORE deep sleep than necessary. This is just an example from last night\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThat looks similar to mine. I\\'ve been wearing mine quite loosely and further up my arm. Going to try more tightly and nearer the wrist. I think it\\'s probably not causing the problem though but just wanted to rule it out. I get really tired a lot of the time and think it\\'s maybe because I\\'m not getting enough deep and REM sleep. I don\\'t know what to do about it though!\\n\\n\\nHave you found any rhyme or reason to your sleep? Mine is similar to yours and it\\'s stressing me out a bit. I know in prior models you can change the sensitiviy mode but that doesn\\'t appear to be the case with the Charge 2. Last night I slept a total of 6hrs 20min and got a total of 24min deep sleep\\xa0I\\'m exhausted and I don\\'t know if I\\'m really tired or if it\\'s a mind thing \"knowing\" I only had 24min of deep sleep. This has been they type of sleep report I\\'ve been seeing since they rolled out the cycles. Is something wrong with mine? Is something wrong with me? I\\'m getting stressed over this. I wear it where I\\'m suppose to. Ugh, I guess really venting but hoping others have insight. Thank you! -Piglet612\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat sensitivity setting do you have it on? Or rather, what hand is your dominant hand, what arm do you wear it to sleep, and does your Fitbit settings reflect those?\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere isn\\'t a sensity setting, correct? I wear it on my non dominant hand(left) which is reflected in app. I have tried it on my other wrist tosleep and had same results. The firmware prior to the sleep cycles did notshow the crazy sleep that I\\'m getting with this new version.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nIf you wear it on your non-dominant hand and the app reflects this setting, it\\'s more sensitive and will pick up steps more easily to compensate for the idea that a non-dominant hand will not move as much as a dominant hand. If you switch it to your dominant hand, but leave the app setting for non-dominant hand, you may pick up even more movement. Wearing it on your dominant hand and switching the app setting to reflect this reduces sensitivity for steps (I\\'ve noticed that as I move while I sleep, I wake up with less \"added\" steps if I wear it on my dominant hand). Try giving that a shot, it could make your fitbit less likely to interpret movement during the night as always \"light\" sleep.\\n\\n\\nUnder personal information there is a sleep sensitivity setting: \\xa0 normal or sensitive\\n\\n\\nAccording to my tracker I do get enough deep sleep but get very very little REM sleep most of the nights. It\\'s around 5 % wich is about 30 - 50 minutes. I also hope my fitbit is wrong. If not, is this something to worry about? And what might cause this little REM sleep?\\n\\n\\nI have it on normal, was hoping it was sent on sensitive. I did set it to sensitive and then back to normal hoping that would trigger something. Also, slept with it on sensitive mode and it yielded similar results.\\n\\n\\nMy Fitbit shows I only get 2-4 hours a night sleep. I wonder if it\\'s because I\\'m always restless and turn a lot?\\n\\n\\n@Shirleyy\\xa02-4 hours of sleep out of how many hours of total sleep time.Im averaging 3:58 hours of sleep, but in the last 5 days i only averaged 5 total hors a night of sleep. 20% awake time is considered norma, when you add in the micro periods of awake time.\\n\\n\\nCharge 2,non dominant wrist, high sensitivity. REM averages 12minuets a night,some zero, some as “high” as 30 minutes. Sometimes reported asleep as little as \\xa03 hours, sometimes as much as 6, average Around 5.5. My doctor is under the impression Fitbit numbers are “remarkably unreliable” based on clients whose sleep they’ve studied with the fancy devices. I’ve decided to think of Fitbit as relatively internally accurate but nit realistically calibrated - so I read my numbers as a relative scale WRT sleep, dream, awake times. I wish I had accurate actual times tho...\\n\\n\\nI get about 6% REM at night and I’ve never had sleeping problems except sometimes getting up to pee. That’s about 20 minutes since I get an average of 8hrs 2mins a night. I figure it’s just wildly inaccurate since I don’t seem irritated when I wake up like it says I should. I get sleepy everyday about 3 pm but who doesn’t. Don’t fret the little toy on your wrist. If you’re actually worried a doctor is the person to discuss that with not a forum.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI see this thread started a while back, but wanted to share a similar experience.My deep sleep and light sleep times commonly fall within (and sometimes exceed) the benchmark averages. However, my REM percentages are so low, there is often no percentage reading and it falls well below the benchmarks on the bar graph.Initially I was concerned, then I thought my charge 2 might be\\xa0inaccurate. I decided not to worry about it too much; since that won\\'t help me sleep (!).I had extremely bad sleep for a number of years when I lost my wife to cancer. \\xa0For me, many of the tips for better sleeping help a lot... including guided meditations, occasional magnesium supplement (I use something called \"Calm\"), not exercising right before bed, eating better, etc. etc.I still hope that the Charge 2 is wrong and I\\'m getting more REM. Interested to see more responses in this thread.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nHi sleepy Community members!\\n\\xa0\\nDoes your sleep log look something like this?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you think your log is inaccurate when it shows this much restlessness, you\\'re not alone! A lot of Fitbit users have sleep logs like this, and many times it\\'s due to the fact that Sleep settings are on \"Sensitive\" mode instead of \"Normal\" mode. A little about these two modes:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.\\nThe sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep.\\n\\nWe strongly suggest that most users use the Normal setting. To change your settings to Normal, follow these steps, or visit our help article!\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTo change your setting\\xa0in the Fitbit iOS app, go to\\xa0Account\\xa0>\\xa0Advanced Settings\\xa0>\\xa0Sleep Sensitivity.\\n\\n\\nTo change your setting in the fitbit.com dashboard, go to\\xa0Settings\\xa0>\\xa0Devices\\xa0> scroll down to\\xa0Sleep Tracking.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nI hope this helps - let me know if you have any trouble changing this setting or if you have seen a difference in the accuracy of your sleep log after switching!\\n\\nCallie | Community Moderator, FitbitWant to join the Fitbit Community Council? Apply here.\\n\\n\\n\\nI found on normal my Charge HR overestimated my sleep, on sensitive it then recorded that my average nights\\' \"sleep\" was 2.5 - 3 hours in 15 - 20 sessions, no evidence of sleep cycles etc.\\xa0This helped me convince my GP that my memory problems, basically a random inability to access previous memories, especially how to find places and people I\\'d been to many times in the past, might be due to sleep.Had the overnight session with electrodes everywhere at Papworth, the UK\\'s sleep clinic, was found to be getting less than half the recommended amount of REM sleep which is when the brain does it\\'s \"memory filing\".Thought to be due to the brain not getting enough oxygen - trial with a CPAP machine reduced number of low oxygen periods from 16 an hour to a normal 4 an hour.\\xa0 Interestingly, not only did the Fitbit record my best ever \"non moving\" sleep (over 5 hours) but also that my heart rate stayed around 60 rather than as usual falling to the low 50\\'s and sometimes even below 50.\\n\\n\\n*yawn* Oh hey\\xa0@CallieM,\\xa0My sleep log (when I still used a Fitbit, and had it on Sensitive) looked a lot like that.\\xa017 times awake23 times awake3:01 really asleep\\xa0^^ A lot of my sleep logs on sensitive looked like THAT \\xa0-Kai\\n\\n\\nGood for you. I got on CPAP in the 90\\'s for the same reasons (plus I was going to sleep everytime I drove) Its well worth the aggrivation of getting used to using it. 🙂\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy sleep log looks that way in both normal and sensitive modes. \\xa0Sometimes it indicates that I do not get to sleep until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, which is grossly\\xa0inaccurate. I routinely go to bed and get to sleep around 10:30pm. However, I do have a problem with sleep-walking.\\n\\n\\nBut - but - but - How do you actually rule out a sleep disorder? I\\'ve got a sleep log that has always looked like that on the sensitive setting. It\\'s probably not a sleep disorder, but I\\'m wondering what happens when people go to a sleep doctor with a log like that. What are the types of movement in normal sleep that log as restless on the sensitive setting? How do you know if your log is \"accurate\" - if you knew whether it was accurate or not, you wouldn\\'t need the Fitbit to track your sleep. (In the meantime I\\'ll go back to the normal setting. )\\n\\n\\nIf you suspect you have a \"sleep disorder\" your doctor can refer you to do a sleep study. This requires at least one over night stay in which they hook you up to several electrodes and they determine if you are having apneas, (breathing lapses) and to what extent, if any. This is pretty conclusive and they will prescribe a cpap machine or some variant which will stop the apneas. They use the numbers gleened from the sleep study to input a certain pressure setting so that you are getting the right level of air to stop the apneas. Hope this helps and hope you are well. 🙂\\n\\n\\nmy fitbit is set to normal but it still has all the restless lines, does anyone know why?\\n\\n\\nThere are chunks of hours missing from my sleep log sometimes each night, so it looks like I only slept 2 hours instead of 8. I have switched from normal to sensitive and back, made sure my fitbit was fully charged each night, tried switching wrists. It seems accurate the times I do wake up to go to the ladies room, and the time I wake up, but the time I went to bed/sleep vs it says when I actually was asleep, can also be hours off.\\xa0 I think the sleep is monitored by heart rate correct? If its at a low hr\\xa0its considered sleep? Its not like I am sleep walking, or it would say I am awake right? Or would track additional steps? I believe the \"restlessness\" times, (too many animals in my bed and can tell by how trashed my bed is in the morning) but I dont understand the missing chunks of time.\\xa0 Am I transporting myself into another dimension?\\xa0 lol\\xa0 Or does my fit bit have a glitch/issue?

Switching to normal gives me results that correspond more with how I experience the night, but then - why use fitbit at all? At this point it\\'s just a handy log of when I went to bed and got up. But you may have a clue in mentioning animals on the bed. I don\\'t have animals and switching to normal worked; while you have animals and switching to normal doesn\\'t work. Still leaves the question of what it\\'s measuring. Animals shifting? Someone snoring? Someone breathing? Telepathic reception of all dreams going on in the bed?In the meantime, grinding my manual coffee grinder (circular motion with arm) gives me steps so maybe that\\'s what FB is: something that saves us from carrying pencil and paper around.In normal, pre-FB life, I can tell if I\\'m getting adequate sleep (what sleep deficit has accumulated) by how long weekend naps are and how necessary a nap feels when I\\'m home and it\\'s a real possibility.\\n\\n\\nHello,I have a problem with Sleep monitoring - my Fitbit assumes that I am asleep, when I am awake.I have the fitbit charge HR on my dnon-dominant hand, and I have the sleep setting on Normal and wrist placement on dominant.\\xa0I usually lie in bed for about half an hour in the morning, listening to the radio and using my phone, however this is still seen as sleep -sometimes I can even go to the loo and still be classed as asleep.I tried using sensitive and had incredibly innacurate sleep reading and if I set the wrist placement to non-dominant, Fitbit overestimates my steps by about 20%.It would be nice to modestly increase the sensitivity of the device during sleep, but not wakefulness, so it becomes more accurate.\\n\\n\\n@Rowmoseley\\xa0thanks for chiming in with your experience. I\\'m glad your tracker was able to mimic what the CPAP machine was helping with.\\xa0@Synapz\\xa0are you still having an issue with this?\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@SunsetRunner\\xa0Fitbit provides services to help you live a healthier life, but please keep in mind that our trackers and services\\xa0are not intended to provide medical data. Please see your doctor if you\\'re concerned with being diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Also, as the original post mentions, the \"normal\" setting is going to be the most accurate setting for almost everyone, and we strongly suggest most everyone use the normal setting.\\n\\xa0\\n@sharimah\\xa0it\\'s normal to still have restless lines in your sleep log, even if it\\'s set to \"normal.\" I\\'d be a little concerned if there weren\\'t any (or a little jealous, because it means you sleep like a log and don\\'t move at all during the night!)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@NugsMom\\xa0hmm, that sounds odd. Sleep is monitored by movement, so if you have a lot of animals in your bed, and you\\'re moving a lot during the night, your tracker might actually think you\\'re awake. That being said, can you please\\xa0try a restart of your tracker? Let me know if this helps at all.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@djbarker\\xa0thanks for your question. Since your tracker determines \"sleep\" by how much movement you make during the night, if you\\'re laying in bed in the morning being relatively still, your tracker may still \\'think\\' you are asleep. If you\\'re concerned about your awake time being inaccurate, you can go into your sleep log and edit your awake time.

Are there physical factors that correlate roughly to actual sleep but that aren’t actual artifacts of sleep?(Kind of like the way grinding coffee on my manual coffee grinder with my Fitbit arm adds up steps.)

       " '\\nAnyone else using the new pulse ox feature and being told that you die at night? lol! My nightly range is from 89-93%... which seems like I\\'m oxygen deprived at night. Of course I know that it can\\'t be medically accurate since it\\'s on our wrist and we move around a lot, but just wondering if anyone else is getting really low ranges. And are we all at 93% right now? I compared to 6 friends, everyone\\'s said 93%.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI disagree that it can\\'t be medically accurate, and you are still alive.\\xa0 Perhaps you are comparing to waking SpO2 levels, but sleeping SpO2 levels are lower.\\xa0 According to one medical source I just looked up:\"Oxygen levels are considered abnormal when they fall below 88%.\"I am not saying that it is accurate, but just that 89-93 could be reasonable.\\n\\nBefore posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am also interested in the Versa 2 accuracy for SpO2.\\xa0 My nightly values have varied much more than I would expect.\\xa0 Two nights ago the range was 92%-95% and last night it was 97%-100%.\\xa0 Over 12 nights of data, the minimum values are between 88% and 97%;\\xa0 the averages are between 93% and 98%; the maximum values are between 95% and 100%.\\xa0 My daytime SpO2 values with a finger pulse oximeter are consistently 96%-98%.\\n\\n\\nI have been between 92 and 94 for the past 2 weeks. Now it doesn\\'t monitor at all. totally stopped working. went on site for help and they tell me that my watch doesn\\'t match my name. i explained to the I have upgraded my watch 2 times since being on site, but they have me check somewhere else and when I come back they are gone. What a great support group from FitBit.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy pulse and Spo2 are 2 numbers less than my pulse oximeter. 68bpm would be 70 and my Spo2 would be 95 instead of 98.some times my pulse will match Spo2 not so much.\\n\\n\\n@AragonAl\\xa0it is hard to talk about accuracy when you have no access to data on demand. You can\\'t cross-examine results with any other device and neither you can do the on-the-spot test. In such a case, I wouldn\\'t stress too much with the results if even Fitbit isn\\'t confident enough to release the SpO2 feature such as it could be tested for accuracy and verified against other devices.\\n\\n\\nIf you have sleep apnea like I me you stop breathing for a few seconds each night . This may effect the Spo2 reading.I can\\'t say for sure since the watch can\\'t give me a reading during the day.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPulse oximetry is a standard monitoring device in intensive care units ICUs, currently used to guide therapeutic interventions. Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of SPO\\xa0in critically ill patients. Our objective was to compare pulse oximetry with arterial oxygen saturation SAO2\\xa0in such patients, and to examine the effect of several factors on this relationship.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI have been monitoring the Fitbit (night) vs Oximeter during the day.\\xa0 Big disconnect, although night time is supposed to be lower than daytime.\\xa0 I think the delta is too high at 2-3%.\\xa0 Anyway there is a BIG spread in daily Fitbit O2 levels whereas the oximeter is much more steady and stable.\\xa0 I personally think that the Fitbit is not all that accurate as I have had medical grade oximeter readings a few time this month and they are a much better match to the oximeter than the Fitbit.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy FitBit gives me lower readings than my oxymeter. I think it\\'s probable that your Fitbit along with your 6 friends are getting readings below what is accurate.\\xa0 Mmy fitbit says at night my oxygen is 95-97%.\\xa0 That is lower than normal for me but I am currently not near my oxymeter so I have to wait to get home to compare the accuracy.\\n\\n\\nSame I’m between 90-94 I need to stop looking at it I am getting anxiety 😟. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nYour oxygen levels do decrease while your sleeping since your breathing is steady and slower. Your oxygen level will very based on the type of sleep you have as well; light sleep, deep sleep, or REM sleep. 90% or higher is normal oxygenation when sleeping.\\xa0 Then factor in mouth breathing, illness, stuffy nose, etc. can change your O2 levels as well.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI just downloaded the spo2 clock for my versa 2 a couple hours ago and it’s reading \\xa078-81 but I’m breathing fine so I’m questioning the accuracy of this\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHis is the problem I’m having. My oxygen read as 78 last night. But I feel fine, lol. Did you ever get it figured out?\\n\\n\\nNever solved.\\xa0 Delta continues to be about 2% from daytime vs.sleep.\\xa0 That said, it is within the measuring error of the devices of +/- 2%.\\xa0 See the latest Oximeter vs. Fitbit plot below.\\xa0 \\xa0this is just short of 9 months of data.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThanks for posting. Yeah, same here. It’s not accurate. While lower amounts may be “normal,“ it’s not healthy to have levels that low while sleeping. The heart rate is never 100% accurate either. It’s usually off by about 5 to 10% in my experience. I don’t mind that as much because in many cases one doesn’t really need an exact heart rate assessment. Oxygenation is much more acute, though, with a 5% oxygenation variation representing a much bigger difference than a 5% heart rate difference.\\xa0What’s extra frustrating is that there seem to be only responses from\\xa0other users and giving their opinions and sharing their experiences, but not Fitbit employees with product knowledge explaining the latest technical details to us an answer to these questions. While the former can be helpful, the latter is what’s really needed here. Anybody with me on this? Anyway, I hope we can get some answers. Not just opinion.\\n\\n\\nI fully agree.\\xa0 We can opine till we are blue in the face, but it would be great to hear from the Fitbit people.\\xa0 I will update the graph every so often as well.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMine was 95 % but I\\'m a restless sleeper\\xa0\\n\\n\\nYou have the right idea... pulse oximeters are only estimates to get you \"ballpark figures\" and not FDA accurate (as with a blood draw, ouch!).\\xa0 There are many factors that cause variations and thus inaccuracies with these devices such as skin color, smoking, room lighting, poor blood circulation due to arm and clothing positioning, etc.\\xa0 It is suggested that you can expect a +/- 4% variation in accuracy with pulse oximeters vs blood draw measurements.\\xa0 Since a watch does not have as secure placement against the skin, I would suppose yet another avenue for variation and thus a further decrease in accuracy is possible perhaps.\\xa0 These devices are not true medical devices and are only meant to give you awareness of when you should consider seeking medical advice.\\xa0 Fitbit\\'s own advice is as follows... \"The data provided by Fitbit SpO2 is intended to be a close estimation of your blood oxygen saturation levels, but may not be precisely accurate. You should not use or rely on Fitbit SpO2 for any medical purposes.\"\\xa0 However my take on it is this: I\\'d rather have this estimate available to me than not... so thank you Fitbit for including it in the feature set for this watch.\\xa0 So to answer your question above... so far I get an average anywhere from 93% up to 96% with my lowest in range ever being down to 90%-93%.\\xa0 Remember with a recognized 4% variation for the pulse oximeter technology, my 93% average could theoretically have been as low as 89% true oxygen saturation (time to consult a medical professional) and my lowest in range could have dropped to as low as 86%, gasp!\\xa0 I\\'m not worried however as I don\\'t wake up continuously all night long and I feel well rested in the mornings.\\n\\n\\nI was getting low readings, averaging 85-88 per night.\\xa0 I was getting anxious and spoke to my doctor about this but he was not overly concerned since it was a wrist reading and many things can interfere with an accurate reading.\\xa0 His advice (which seems to have worked) helped and my readings are 93-96 overnight.His advice was since we tend to wear our watch nonstop with showers, exercise, cooking, cleaning, etc it is important to ensure any particles on the wrist and watch are cleaned and not interfering with the sensor:Ensure the sensor does not have any dirt, dust, or other particle on it.\\xa0 Just before bed wash your wrist and wipe the sensor area of the watch.\\xa0 Lotions, dust, and other particles transferred from our skin or from normal wear can create an interference of the sensor light.\\xa0 Even natural oils from our skin need to be wiped off the back of the watch or if we shower with it, water that dries on the sensor can leave a \"haze\" (think dried water on a window type spot).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I started to clean my wrist where the sensor meets the skin with an astrigent cleaner or alcohol right before bed and will wipe down the back of my watch with a clean cloth (almost like polishing) and it really has helped to get a more accurate reading.\\xa0 It has only been +/- 1 or 2 numbers off now instead of 10.\\n',\n",

If I don\\'t fall asleep at the wheel first. 😕\\xa0Most of my sleep data seems very....strange. I will include some recent screen shots. My doc wonders if I have sleep apnea, but the spO2 log has never shown any high variations. In the last week or so, my allergies have been horrible, and I\\'ve gotten one speck of high variation at night. I also have never experienced the other symptoms of sleep apnea (gasping) except for being tired all the time.\\xa0I will also be evaluated for narcolepsy because I have hallucinations and fragmented sleep and nightmares, and some days I could happily sleep all day. But not everyday day is like that! So my symptoms seem ambiguous. Maybe there\\'s nothing wrong with me at all except for anxiety.\\xa0\\xa0So I\\'m wondering...looking at these sleep charts...do you think my fitbit is functioning correctly???? Should I discount this information or show it to my specialist?\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\n\\n\\nWithout having read your description, I wouldn\\'t see any concern with your sleep logs. I do note a couple of nights when you got low scores, that is actually because the log was broken in two, giving you two shorter logs as if you had a longer wake period during the night, not necessarily a problem or possible a misreading.\\xa0 In either case, if considered together, it would have given you a decent score.\\n\\nBefore posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how much I trust the score. One night I got an \"excellent \" score, still woke up feeling like trash and took a midday nap.I\\'m more concerned about my crazy sleep cycles.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe \\'craziness\\' of them wasn\\'t obvious to me, but maybe to another; also kinda hard to see detail at that scale picture.\\n\\nBefore posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.\\n\\n',\n",

Since I was a child I remember looking at a clock until 4am in the morning.At some point i\\'ve tried Melatonin (1 night only, when I was a student), but I woke up so tired, just like I never slept.So usually when I was student and had an exam, stay awake all night, coffee, cigarettes, getting the exam, get home at 4-5pm next day and then sleep until next morning.I\\'ve read a book about sleep stages, \"Sleep\" by\\xa0Nick Littlehales. It helped alot and I started to use some techniques from there.\\xa0Now, I\\'m 30, work exclusively from home and have a 1 year daughter. My go to bed schedule is the following:- 23:30 - 01:00 - reading- 01:00 - 01:30 - sudoku (you can laugh) to kill any processing power left in my brainThen I fell asleep in 5mins or so (before this it would take me about 30m - 1h30m to fell asleep)In the morning I wake up at 9:00-9:20.\\xa0I\\'ll try now to push everything down by 30mins so I can wake up 30mins earlier.\\xa0Hope this helps.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHi\\xa0@adinasavescu,\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nInteresting!

In general, this is very important, you can read in more detail here https://studymoose.com/sleep about this topic. I didn\\'t take any pills, I just put my life in order.

Beware of this so call sleep medication because it isn\\'t to be used as a sedative. Magnesium is better for sleep as not only does it help you calm the mind it also helps your heart & the rest of your body functions.Most of us now lack magnesium.\\n\\n\\n@Xenus\\xa0It\\'s nice to see you around!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWow, 😮 this is very great information and thanks for taking the time to share this with us!\\xa0🙂\\n\\xa0\\nSee you around.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\\n\\n\\n\\nGlad to see this topic.\\xa0 \\xa0I just wanted to fall asleep a bit faster.\\xa0 I bought Melatonin 3 mg.\\xa0 \\xa0So, I took a 3 mg and cut it in half, so I figured it was about 1.5mg.\\xa0 I felt less was more for me.

Melatonin is naturally produce in the darkness of night whether you sleep or are awake. Sleep is natural and important to your well-being and for those that don\\'t sleep well it\\'s best to try and find the source of why not. You cannot force yourself to sleep and you need to find what time is your natural time to sleep and wakeup refreshed plus able to function well the next day. Melatonin can be taken in the morning to help (but there\\'s little evidence that it works) or 7-8 hours before bed to help change your bedtime to earlier.Melatonin is used for those with sleep disorders of the circadian clock cycle where someone\\'s sleep is out of sync with the rest of the society yet the use of melatonin for this purpose doesn\\'t have any proof of correcting the sleep wake times. I would say that melatonin serves little use in helping a person to fall asleep. Melatonin can cause nightmares,reduced body temperature,changes to heart rate,sweating,feeling cold and shouldn\\'t be taken by those that are diabetic.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nHello\\xa0@GretaS,\\xa0@cathm,\\xa0@Xenus.

At night, I switch it to my dominant wrist to give my other wrist a break. I leave it set to \"nondominant\" in the app and loosen the strap one notch at night because that seems more comfortable.\\xa0\\xa0I get good, reliable sleep data doing this and I\\'ve done it for years, with every device I\\'ve had. I started out years ago, with an Alta HR. Now I\\'m using a Sense, so I\\'ve had a big range of devices and this routine has always worked well for me. I don\\'t know if it would work for anyone else.\\xa0\\n\\nAmanda | Wyoming, USA\\n\\n\\n\\nI deleted the \"sleep\" card from my dashboard. Seems like since Alpha bought out the company, the sleep tracker is pretty worthless; and it wasn\\'t all that useful before. I\\'ve never liked that it was a total black box and that you could have quite similar sleep \"patterns\" from day to day but get wildly different results. Frankly, I prefer to base my evaluation of \"sleep score\" based on how refreshed I feel when I rise.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNo I do not. Sometimes, I charge my fitbit over night, so thats obvious. Sometimes, it plain bothers me to wear it at night and I take it off sometime during the night.\\xa0Right now I am trying to be more constant to figure out my sleep patterns after having a drink in the evening.\\n\\n\\n@alexthecat\\xa0what is your reason for not setting it on \"dominant\" in the app?\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\tNote: Despite profile name, I am not a runner.

I do find that, whenever I start using a new device, it will take a couple of nights to figure out how to wear it at night. I\\'m not comfortable if it\\'s too tight, but if it\\'s too loose it won\\'t be able to read my heart rate. It can take a while to get that worked out, but then I\\'m good for a long time.\\xa0\\n\\nAmanda | Wyoming, USA\\n\\n\\n\\nI first used Fitbit back when it was Charge (version 1) and then Charge 2 when that came out.\\xa0 After that, I switched to Polar and then Garmin and some other China brands and some European brands.\\xa0 I have not seen another app like Fitbit\\'s which tracks my weird multiple-sleep-patterns (I tend to wake up at 2am and sleep again at 5am) as almost every other brand treats my first sleep at the ONLY sleep I\\'ve during the night.\\xa0Now I am back to Charge 4 even though Charge 5 is out.\\xa0 And the ONLY reason I got it was because of this special ability for the app to track my multiple sleeps at night + naps during the day.\\xa0 If it doesn\\'t do that, then I am back to Garmin (my favourite, as it tracks my swim the best).\\xa0What\\'s this I hear about Fitbit charging premium for people to view their sleep patterns?\\n\\n\\nYes, I found that when I didnt, I felt like I\\'d had poor sleep. The reason I started tracking my sleep, was to help with my recovery from covid pneumonia. After a spell in hospital 4 months ago, I had a very slow recovery. I\\'m walking regularly now, but not running yet, still to weak and tired. One thing covid affects is sleep. Prior to this illness, i\\'d go to bed between 1-2am and sleep till about 8am, and managed just fine. I never woke when I slept, other than occasionally if I needed the loo.These days i\\'m waking around 3-6 times a night, although it is improving. The fitbit is useful not just for the tracking of sleep, but night time heart rate. You can see when you were in deep sleep, and when you were restless.My average heart rate is still quite high, it hovers around 67-73, but I did have to recover from a Tachycardia caused by my illness. That, thankfully has now gone.Generally, when i\\'m active during the day, my heart rate is 75-95, depending on activity. When I move around, around 90-110. Walking briskly, I\\'m around 100-120. So getting back to more normal numbers I hope.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been sleep tracking everyday since I started using my Sense end of December 2021. Prior to that I was using my Wear OS Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle with the app Sleep As Android for about 2.5 years. I think it did well in tracking, although I never saw a comparison with an EEG like I have with the Sense. But my sleep score wasn\\'t very helpful, was on a scale out of 5. Sense sleep tracking, especially with the premium, is definitely more helpful and informative and I think the score correlates well with how I felt about my sleep. I\\'ve been averaging low 80s per week which I would say isn\\'t too bad considering we\\'ve had a <1 year old baby sleeping in a our room. 🙂\\n\\n\\nYes my Charge5 give sleep data\\xa0 every day\\n\\n\\nMine is not correct.

Better having light sleep than none at all - and crucially I was awake for 1 hour 28 minutes and I guess it is that element that reduces my overall sleep efficiency.

       " '\\nHi sleepy Community members!\\n\\xa0\\nDoes your sleep log look something like this?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you think your log is inaccurate when it shows this much restlessness, you\\'re not alone! A lot of Fitbit users have sleep logs like this, and many times it\\'s due to the fact that Sleep settings are on \"Sensitive\" mode instead of \"Normal\" mode. A little about these two modes:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.\\nThe sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep.\\n\\nWe strongly suggest that most users use the Normal setting. To change your settings to Normal, follow these steps, or visit our help article!\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTo change your setting\\xa0in the Fitbit iOS app, go to\\xa0Account\\xa0>\\xa0Advanced Settings\\xa0>\\xa0Sleep Sensitivity.\\n\\n\\nTo change your setting in the fitbit.com dashboard, go to\\xa0Settings\\xa0>\\xa0Devices\\xa0> scroll down to\\xa0Sleep Tracking.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nI hope this helps - let me know if you have any trouble changing this setting or if you have seen a difference in the accuracy of your sleep log after switching!\\n\\nCallie | Community Moderator, FitbitWant to join the Fitbit Community Council? Apply here.\\n\\n\\n\\nI found on normal my Charge HR overestimated my sleep, on sensitive it then recorded that my average nights\\' \"sleep\" was 2.5 - 3 hours in 15 - 20 sessions, no evidence of sleep cycles etc.\\xa0This helped me convince my GP that my memory problems, basically a random inability to access previous memories, especially how to find places and people I\\'d been to many times in the past, might be due to sleep.Had the overnight session with electrodes everywhere at Papworth, the UK\\'s sleep clinic, was found to be getting less than half the recommended amount of REM sleep which is when the brain does it\\'s \"memory filing\".Thought to be due to the brain not getting enough oxygen - trial with a CPAP machine reduced number of low oxygen periods from 16 an hour to a normal 4 an hour.\\xa0 Interestingly, not only did the Fitbit record my best ever \"non moving\" sleep (over 5 hours) but also that my heart rate stayed around 60 rather than as usual falling to the low 50\\'s and sometimes even below 50.\\n\\n\\n*yawn* Oh hey\\xa0@CallieM,\\xa0My sleep log (when I still used a Fitbit, and had it on Sensitive) looked a lot like that.\\xa017 times awake23 times awake3:01 really asleep\\xa0^^ A lot of my sleep logs on sensitive looked like THAT \\xa0-Kai\\n\\n\\nGood for you. I got on CPAP in the 90\\'s for the same reasons (plus I was going to sleep everytime I drove) Its well worth the aggrivation of getting used to using it. 🙂\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy sleep log looks that way in both normal and sensitive modes. \\xa0Sometimes it indicates that I do not get to sleep until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, which is grossly\\xa0inaccurate. I routinely go to bed and get to sleep around 10:30pm. However, I do have a problem with sleep-walking.\\n\\n\\nBut - but - but - How do you actually rule out a sleep disorder? I\\'ve got a sleep log that has always looked like that on the sensitive setting. It\\'s probably not a sleep disorder, but I\\'m wondering what happens when people go to a sleep doctor with a log like that. What are the types of movement in normal sleep that log as restless on the sensitive setting? How do you know if your log is \"accurate\" - if you knew whether it was accurate or not, you wouldn\\'t need the Fitbit to track your sleep. (In the meantime I\\'ll go back to the normal setting. )\\n\\n\\nIf you suspect you have a \"sleep disorder\" your doctor can refer you to do a sleep study. This requires at least one over night stay in which they hook you up to several electrodes and they determine if you are having apneas, (breathing lapses) and to what extent, if any. This is pretty conclusive and they will prescribe a cpap machine or some variant which will stop the apneas. They use the numbers gleened from the sleep study to input a certain pressure setting so that you are getting the right level of air to stop the apneas. Hope this helps and hope you are well. 🙂\\n\\n\\nmy fitbit is set to normal but it still has all the restless lines, does anyone know why?\\n\\n\\nThere are chunks of hours missing from my sleep log sometimes each night, so it looks like I only slept 2 hours instead of 8. I have switched from normal to sensitive and back, made sure my fitbit was fully charged each night, tried switching wrists. It seems accurate the times I do wake up to go to the ladies room, and the time I wake up, but the time I went to bed/sleep vs it says when I actually was asleep, can also be hours off.\\xa0 I think the sleep is monitored by heart rate correct? If its at a low hr\\xa0its considered sleep? Its not like I am sleep walking, or it would say I am awake right? Or would track additional steps? I believe the \"restlessness\" times, (too many animals in my bed and can tell by how trashed my bed is in the morning) but I dont understand the missing chunks of time.\\xa0 Am I transporting myself into another dimension?\\xa0 lol\\xa0 Or does my fit bit have a glitch/issue?

Switching to normal gives me results that correspond more with how I experience the night, but then - why use fitbit at all? At this point it\\'s just a handy log of when I went to bed and got up. But you may have a clue in mentioning animals on the bed. I don\\'t have animals and switching to normal worked; while you have animals and switching to normal doesn\\'t work. Still leaves the question of what it\\'s measuring. Animals shifting? Someone snoring? Someone breathing? Telepathic reception of all dreams going on in the bed?In the meantime, grinding my manual coffee grinder (circular motion with arm) gives me steps so maybe that\\'s what FB is: something that saves us from carrying pencil and paper around.In normal, pre-FB life, I can tell if I\\'m getting adequate sleep (what sleep deficit has accumulated) by how long weekend naps are and how necessary a nap feels when I\\'m home and it\\'s a real possibility.\\n\\n\\nHello,I have a problem with Sleep monitoring - my Fitbit assumes that I am asleep, when I am awake.I have the fitbit charge HR on my dnon-dominant hand, and I have the sleep setting on Normal and wrist placement on dominant.\\xa0I usually lie in bed for about half an hour in the morning, listening to the radio and using my phone, however this is still seen as sleep -sometimes I can even go to the loo and still be classed as asleep.I tried using sensitive and had incredibly innacurate sleep reading and if I set the wrist placement to non-dominant, Fitbit overestimates my steps by about 20%.It would be nice to modestly increase the sensitivity of the device during sleep, but not wakefulness, so it becomes more accurate.\\n\\n\\n@Rowmoseley\\xa0thanks for chiming in with your experience. I\\'m glad your tracker was able to mimic what the CPAP machine was helping with.\\xa0@Synapz\\xa0are you still having an issue with this?\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@SunsetRunner\\xa0Fitbit provides services to help you live a healthier life, but please keep in mind that our trackers and services\\xa0are not intended to provide medical data. Please see your doctor if you\\'re concerned with being diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Also, as the original post mentions, the \"normal\" setting is going to be the most accurate setting for almost everyone, and we strongly suggest most everyone use the normal setting.\\n\\xa0\\n@sharimah\\xa0it\\'s normal to still have restless lines in your sleep log, even if it\\'s set to \"normal.\" I\\'d be a little concerned if there weren\\'t any (or a little jealous, because it means you sleep like a log and don\\'t move at all during the night!)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@NugsMom\\xa0hmm, that sounds odd. Sleep is monitored by movement, so if you have a lot of animals in your bed, and you\\'re moving a lot during the night, your tracker might actually think you\\'re awake. That being said, can you please\\xa0try a restart of your tracker? Let me know if this helps at all.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@djbarker\\xa0thanks for your question. Since your tracker determines \"sleep\" by how much movement you make during the night, if you\\'re laying in bed in the morning being relatively still, your tracker may still \\'think\\' you are asleep. If you\\'re concerned about your awake time being inaccurate, you can go into your sleep log and edit your awake time.

Are there physical factors that correlate roughly to actual sleep but that aren’t actual artifacts of sleep?(Kind of like the way grinding coffee on my manual coffee grinder with my Fitbit arm adds up steps.)

Seems like since Alpha bought out the company, the sleep tracker is pretty worthless; and it wasn\\'t all that useful before.

Frankly, I prefer to base my evaluation of \"sleep score\" based on how refreshed I feel when I rise.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNo I do not. Sometimes, I charge my fitbit over night, so thats obvious.

The reason I started tracking my sleep, was to help with my recovery from covid pneumonia. After a spell in hospital 4 months ago, I had a very slow recovery. I\\'m walking regularly now, but not running yet, still to weak and tired. One thing covid affects is sleep. Prior to this illness, i\\'d go to bed between 1-2am and sleep till about 8am, and managed just fine. I never woke when I slept, other than occasionally if I needed the loo.These days i\\'m waking around 3-6 times a night, although it is improving. The fitbit is useful not just for the tracking of sleep, but night time heart rate. You can see when you were in deep sleep, and when you were restless.My average heart rate is still quite high, it hovers around 67-73, but I did have to recover from a Tachycardia caused by my illness. That, thankfully has now gone.Generally, when i\\'m active during the day, my heart rate is 75-95, depending on activity. When I move around, around 90-110. Walking briskly, I\\'m around 100-120. So getting back to more normal numbers I hope.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been sleep tracking everyday since I started using my Sense end of December 2021. Prior to that I was using my Wear OS Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle with the app Sleep As Android for about 2.5 years. I think it did well in tracking, although I never saw a comparison with an EEG like I have with the Sense. But my sleep score wasn\\'t very helpful, was on a scale out of 5. Sense sleep tracking, especially with the premium, is definitely more helpful and informative and I think the score correlates well with how I felt about my sleep. I\\'ve been averaging low 80s per week which I would say isn\\'t too bad considering we\\'ve had a <1 year old baby sleeping in a our room. 🙂\\n\\n\\nYes my Charge5 give sleep data\\xa0 every day\\n\\n\\nMine is not correct.

I’ll send you a friend request on Fitbit now & then I’ll drop you a DM. I’m considering my next steps, as I’m sure you are too.Becky.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHmm, same issue here. I only noticed the spike a few days ago, and wondered if there’s a bug in Fitbit’s display of time/timezones…There’s one spike almost every night at the beginning around deep or light sleep, according to Fitbit app, before heart rate mellows out until I wake up. Would be great to know if anyone gets more information from their PCP.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI know that a lot of you like to compare your sleep patterns to others\\' so you can see if your sleep is in the normal range. A lot of you suspect that you may have a sleeping disorder such as Narcolepsy or Hypersomnia. From what I\\'ve read, experts believe that there are many people suffering with undiagnosed sleeping disorders, so don\\'t be afraid to bring this up to your physician, and advocate for yourself. My primary care physician initially just thought I was tired because I had four small children. Fortunately (well, in terms of getting a diagnosis is was fortunate), I was suffering from some other symptoms that pointed to more of a sleeping disorder as opposed to just the daytime sleepiness, so he referred me to a Pulmonologist who speacialized in Sleep Medicine. I did an overnight sleep study and a sleep latency nap study the following day. The criterion for a diagnosis of Narcolepsy (at least it was in 2006) is a sleep latency (time it takes to fall asleep) of less than five minutes for five naps (20 minutes max length) that are spaced two hours apart, and you must enter REM sleep in at least two of the five naps.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHere is a sampling of my sleep patterns according to my FitBit. I\\'ve definitely seen a lot worse on here. LOL That\\'s why I\\'m posting this so that some of you might feel confident enough to tell your docs that you think there might be something more than just your average sleepiness. Now, I will say that part of the problem for Narcoleptics is not spending enough time in the most restorative stages of the sleep. Fitbit only records \"restless\" and \"deep sleep\" and of course it\\'s not based on brain waves, so there\\'s no way to know when you\\'ve been in REM sleep, etc. However, it gives you a pretty good idea of the amount of sleep you\\'re getting.\\n\\xa0\\nI tried to include a wide sampling, showing some of my best and worst nights. Also, I \\xa0have it set to sensitive and dominant hand, but wear it on my non-dominant wrist to see if sensitivty was decreased. I\\'ve worn it on both wrists with the same settings and I don\\'t think I noticed a huge difference.\\n\\xa0\\nHave fun analyzing!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is actualy reall interesting to see, i tend to have a lot of restlessness during the night, being restless for anything over 2 hours during my sleep, and it seems to take forever to fall aslepp, some of my patterns seem pretty similar to yous, i have mine to high senstivity on my non dominant hand. i dont suppose they gave you any tips on how to help with your sleep pattern, or sleep efficency, mine is constantly quite low.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI am diagnosed with primary Hypersimnia and have had the same sleep study in 2006.

Show us!\\n\\n\\n\\nI was diagnosed with narcolepsy back in 2015 and just last week I saw a sale for the FitBit Flex. I decided to get it while it was cheep just to see what this thing said my sleep looked like... it\\'s depressing. I will open my sleep chart to all but I get 3.5hr a night on average for a 8 hour nights sleep.\\xa0I went to the doctor to get tested for a sleep disorder when I almost fell asleep driving with my kid in the car. (Luckily I noticed and pulled over to switch drivers with my wife.) Low and behold it was full blown narcolepsy.\\xa0If you feel like you never sleep but are always sleeping... GET TESTED.

Since there is no way to adjust that, you will end up like me- exercising an hour a day, eating half as much as you burn, and not losing any weight whatsoever.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThis is really interesting. \\xa0My background is I am awaiting for a second opinion at Stanford soon. \\xa0I have an appt for the PSG and hopefully a MSLT, but only if they deem needed.\\xa0Where I live I had one done and yes it has shown issues, but nothing that they can apparently help me with except medication. \\xa0Problem is, is I\\'m having problems with the meds and the sleep doc here in town is the only one and you cannot get in to see him. \\xa0My own doc doesn\\'t understand other medications for this problem, so she sent me to Stanford for help. \\xa0I also have other issue\\'s that have made me wonder if I also have an Autoimmune disorder so I am trying to get help with that too while I\\'m there.. Who know\\'s maybe their connected.Ok, so anyway, I just got a fitbit Charge2. \\xa0I have to admit it\\'s quite interesting watching my sleep patterns everynight. \\xa0So far I have done 3 nights \\xa0First 2 I was shocked when it said I was only getting 2 hours and 19 mins of sleep that night! \\xa0Next night it was 2 hours and 17 mins, and last night was much better.... 4 hours and some mins... can\\'t remember. \\xa0I am shocked. \\xa0really shocked. \\xa0I\\'m supposed to be keeping a log anyway to bring in right before I go to my appt so this is great as I can download all of this info.Thanks. \\xa0Would love to see more peoples results..\\n\\n\\nOh and I forgot to add.... I have been the same way with my weight... I am so frustrated as I lost 90 pds years ago. \\xa0It wasn\\'t easy as I found the only way I could do it was by eating 500-800 cals a day. \\xa0If I ate more than 1000-1200 I would gain. \\xa0People didn\\'t believe me. \\xa0But it was true. \\xa0I thought well hell, it\\'s menopause. \\xa0But noo.... now I don\\'t believe so.\\n\\n\\nIdiopathic Hypersomnolence World wide (Idiopathic Hypersomnia)\\n\\n\\nWhat an interesting thread! Now that sleep stages are available, I\\'d be interested in seeing what diagnosed narcoleptics are seeing now. I suspect based on my own (not diagnosed with narcolepsy) experiences that fitbit does overestimate what it calls deep sleep, and naps throughout the day usually seem to have an \"onset\" of either 1 or 6 minutes, which seems more like an artifact of the 5 minute HR sampling than an honest guess at when sleep commences.\\n\\n\\nWere you ever able to post an image of what your sleep chart looks like?

However, the percent sleep which is what I missedoriginally, I have figured out a way to calculate that myself.

       " '\\nI\\'ve been tracking for a month now and I seem to get somewhere between 10-20 minutes of deep sleep a night, even when I sleep 8 hours. I have always been a very tired feeling\\xa0person all the time and I\\'m wondering if this deep sleep tracking is\\xa0(1) accurate, (2) a sign I should see a doctor?\\xa0Also, I have little kids\\xa0and, while they\\'re not waking me up necessarily at night, I wonder if my vigilance about\\xa0them is keeping me from resting fully? Anyone have experience with very little deep sleep?\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll add that it\\'s on the normal setting\\n\\n\\nI have the same issue. I used to think I wasn\\'t getting enough sleep, but I see from tracking that I AM getting sleep - just below the normal range for deep sleep. Therefore, I don\\'t feel rested even if I meet my sleep goal. And I agree, I bet it is the vigilance that\\'s keeping you from resting, at least partially. Although even before I had kids, I was always a super light sleeper and woke very easily, from childhood. Any suggestions on how to get more deep sleep, anyone?\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThis could be an inaccurate reading or something else. My fitbit alta did this when i first started doing it but I tried incorporating some supplements such as 3-5mg extended release melatonin on certain nights in addition to L-tryptophan and the readings went to normal. My guess is that I never really had REM sleep before that on a regular basis.\\n\\n\\nI also don\\'t get much deep sleep, usually just under the normal range.\\xa0Typically deep sleep happens earlier at night, so if you are going to sleep too late or have insomnia before falling asleep, that could interrupt your deep sleep patterns.REM sleep tends to happen for most people later in the evening/early morning. Sometimes my REM/deep sleep cycles get mixed up because I think my body is compensating for not getting the deep sleep early on, then alternating sleep cycles more than most people early in the morning.With major insomnia earlier this year, I\\'ve tried taking tea, tinctures and other substances before bed. For me, I have allergies, so loratidine (antihistamine) actually was working the best.Diphenhydramine, Valerian/skullcap, and other substances helped me sleep but didn\\'t improve my deep sleep ratios (sometimes even left me groggier in the mornings.)Typical advice would be: set an alarm to remind you when to go to bed, have some kind of relaxation technique/rituals before bed, drink tea or something relaxing (herbal tea like chamomile, mint), limit screen time, maybe read or something to quiet the mind. These have helped me fall asleep but haven\\'t necessarily improved my deep sleep though. Sorry, that\\'s pretty generic advice... good luck -_- zzz.\\n\\n\\nMe too... I\\'ve always been aware that I am a fairly \\'light\\' sleeper and sadly my fitbit has confirmed it - I get less than half the amount of deep sleep in the benchmark, which is, I think, why I always feel tired even though I sleep about seven and a half hours a night. I know it also doesn\\'t help that I live in a noisy city and I have done all of the usual recommendations (warm bath, cool bedroom, chamomile tea, no alcohol, regular times, no evening screen time, turn off wifi, relaxation beforehand etc), to no avail. Short of moving somewhere that is absolutely silent at night (not gonna happen!), I\\'d love to hear any bright ideas!\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI have narcolepsy (mostly symptom free starting in my 30’s) and I’m ok with close to an hour of deep sleep but feel horrible on night with 20 minutes. Using earplugs helps me a lot. I can’t really tell what causes less deep sleep. It sure messes me up though.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nYou have the same problem as I do! \\xa0I could always fall asleep given the chance yet I can sleep for 8 hours but still only get 20 minutes deep sleep! \\xa0My children have long since grown up @And left home\\xa0so that isn’t the reason!\\n\\n\\nMy Fitbit tells me that most nights I only get about 20 minutes of deep sleep!!\\n\\n\\nHave any of you tried supplementing magnesium before bed? I do epsom salts baths and use magnesium oil spray on my skin after the baths, also taking a dose of ZMA (magnesium & B vits) on nights when I really need sleep.\\xa0 Seems to help me a lot.\\xa0\\n\\nAllie\\n\\n\\n\\nI have the same problem. \\xa0I suffer terribly from insomnia - husband doesn\\'t help with his laptop on til all hours and then waking me up on his toilet trips and once woken I can\\'t get back to sleep, sometimes for 2 or 3 hours. \\xa0I often wake up shattered, even if my Fitbit says I\\'ve had 7+ hours sleep. \\xa0It always shows so little deep sleep that it doesn\\'t even give it a percentage on the \"benchmarking\" tab. \\xa0I get little R.E.M sleep either, I\\'m either awake or in light sleep, \\xa0I used to sleep like a log for 9 hours a night, but since having children I wake at the slightest thing. \\xa0They are almost grown up now, and I suspect the problem may be stress related with work, and or peri menopause. \\xa0I wondered about the Dr but suspect they will either give me tablets and I will feel worse, or tell me to put up with it as sleep is sleep, deep or otherwise. \\xa0It\\'s affecting my ability to function and I worry I\\'m not safe to drive I get so tired. \\xa0Help!!\\n\\n\\nI had the same problem with my husband. He snores terribly and tosses around like a fish flopping in the sun. He has a c-pap machine but he only wears it for about 4 hours a night. Once I’m up, I just can’t go back to sleep. So here’s what I did, and it’s one of those things that people get weird about, but it works for us. We’ve been married for 27 years and happier than ever. Especially since I started sleeping in the guest room. Yes, we now sleep in separate beds. It’s done wonders. I didn’t realize how stressed I was \\xa0just anticipating how bad the night was going to be. I go to bed early, read, have soft music playing and just wind down in my own space. It’s really helped a lot and it’s something I carve out for myself and for my health. Oh, and by the way, now my husband doesn’t stress about waking me up!

The graph legend also states that a green line indicates small variations, while yellow marks bigger variations, so that\\'s also pretty self-explanatory. My graph is almost entirely green every night, but it\\'s fairly low on the chart.

Looking at it again, the graph doesn\\'t actually have a labelled y-axis, so I\\'m thinking maybe it only measures variations and not exact values, and displays them in two ways (ie colour coded and the graph going up and down). Either way, the sample graph used in the article looks fairly similar to mine, so I won\\'t worry about it.\\n\\n\\nHi Emmy,Sleep apnea is the question for me, and the blood oxygen level associated.\\xa0 If there is a large variation (and I think you\\'re correct that there is not a specific measurement on the y-axis--only a relative variation) I check heart rate to see if its elevated.\\xa0 At high variance, there could be less oxygen absorption.\\xa0Looks like a good tool, but is approximate.\\n\\n\\n@Emmy_M\\xa0wrote:Unfortunately, I\\'m unable to\\xa0include a pictureIn order to include a picture, just click on the camera symbol of the toolbar:\\xa0\\xa0The toolbar will look differently if you’re posting from a mobile device, but even on such a device, the reduced toolbar will include a camera symbol.\\xa0After clicking on the camera symbol, point to the screenshot you took (taking screenshots depends on the type of mobile device you’re using, google it if you don’t know how to do it on yours) from the Fitbit app and you will get something looking like this:\\xa0\\xa0My own EOV curves are also always in the low, green area.

In my opinion this is the best wearable Fitbit have produced yet.Search around for just over £100 .You won\\'t be disappointed.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI’m a 75-year-old man, and I’m going to post two graphs. The first one is what I see most every morning when I look at my oxygen variation graph, \\xa0The second is a graph from this morning. \\xa0This is actually the highest spike I’ve ever had. \\xa0About twice a month I’ll see one spike that usually barely goes into the “orange zone.” \\xa0I’m interested in the analysis others might have of this. Since these spikes are the exception and not the rule, and when they occur they are one lone spike and not multiple spikes throughout the night, I tend to think they are not an indication of sleep apnea but are more likely due to my twisting my wrist during sleep in a way that pulls the Fitbit away from my wrist momentarily. \\xa0What do others think.\\xa0\\u2003\\xa0\\u2003\\n\\n\\nI have been thinking the same thing. Mine had two spikes into the yellow last night but most nights has none. I also wondered if it is how I have my arm placed because my son has mild asthma but a couple years ago he got the flu paired with his asthma it caused pneumonia and we spent a few nights in the hospital. Sometimes when he would be sleeping the oxygen level alarm would go off and the nurse would say it was just because he was sleeping on the arm his oxymeter way on, we would move him and sure enough it would go back to normal. I really think Fit bit should have given more detailed info on interpretation of this.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWell, after ten days of no spikes, I had two last night. \\xa0I checked and my heart rate did not change at all during those spike periods, which it would have if I was not getting enough oxygen to my organs. \\xa0Therefore, I think you are correct, these occasional spikes don’t mean much, and are probably in some way related to unusual movement.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDid you ever learn anything further about your few spikes? My graphs look similar to yours and I have the same questions as in your original post.\\n\\n\\nI also get these spikes occasionally but have noticed they seem to occur at the time(s) I get up to use the restroom at night. I’m guessing the action of getting out of bed and walking cause me to breathe deeper, \\xa0causing a high spike.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI am really getting some big variations for oxygen and heart rate\\xa0 \\xa0Tried to post pic and haven\\'t figure it out yet\\xa0\\n\\n\\nInteresting. I had three big spikes last night which is unusual but I also woke up last night and my right arm and hand (arm I wear watch on) were asleep. Maybe that explains the spikes last night.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe graph should be fairly low on the scale and hopefully fully green.With my readings I see this quite a bit, but occasionally see some spikes with the yellow peaks.\\xa0 One thing I am noting is that when I see this my heart rate has dropped too low.\\n\\n\\nMy concern is that my Oxygen Saturation reading on my Fitbit Versa shows a range of 78% to 92% for last night???\\xa0 It is ALWAYS between 89 and 93% which is too low.\\xa0 Correct?\\xa0 How accurate is it?\\xa0 Thanks\\n\\n\\nI have been through sleep testing, overnight at the hospital. My breathing is too shallow so my oxygenation level stays very low. On the Fitbit graph this means I see low variation because the problem is consistent: I’m not getting enough oxygen all night. \\xa0The graph is not helpful for me.\\xa0\\n',\n",

It has to be a glitch. Mine does the exact same thing around 1:30am. It will look normal in the morning, but after I do an exercise during the day, it ads a dramatic spike at 1:30am for that day. It has been doing this since the active zone update.\\n\\n\\nDid anyone ever get an answer here? This glitch still happens to me!\\n\\n\\nI’m wondering the same thing. This has just recently started happening to me.

I went to a cardiologist today for an ECG bc I thought my heart rate was spiking (140+) at 1-2am every night. My doctor even prescribed me beta blockers bc of it!!! So yeah this is a big problem. This is reassuring though. The HR chart says it was at 67 at same time the target HR chart said 141.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDoes anyone know what the answer is to this?

Looks like it has been going on for about 3 years or so. I guess it was never fixed, just glad I am not the only one experiencing this spike at around 1:00 am on an almost daily basis.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThis bug is still happening to me, over 2 years later. I\\'ve noticed a very clear pattern where it shows an abnormal overnight spike only when I exercise earlier in the day - it appears to be something simple like the X axis is overlapping and transposing the exercise heart rate on to the time when I\\'m asleep\\n\\n\\nI am noticing the same thing. When I look in the morning, my HR chart while sleeping looks fine, but after I exercise and look in the evening, there is a spike at 1:30am. It seems to add this back in later, aligning roughly with my peak HR during the day. My sleep restoration HR tracker shows nothing not does my \"When you got your minutes\" report. Before I noticed the misalignment I went to see a doctor that day at the rushed urging of urgent care line got a bunch of tests and an EKG, which were all fine. While I\\'m reassured now by HR tracker in the morning and my sleep restoration HR tracking, I\\'m baffled why Fitbit is adding a HR spike for 1-1:30am later on in the day.\\n\\n\\nSame thing for me.

       " '\\nI got my Charge 2 last Tuesday, put it on and left it on to explore what it can do. It\\'s my first Fitbit and first fitness tracker ever. I am fit, exercise regularly and lead a healthy life, so I\\'d never felt a need for help from a gadget, but finally I broke down, interested primarily in keeping track of my heart rate and sleep patterns.\\xa0I didn\\'t sleep well on Tuesday night, but didn\\'t make much of it. I generally sleep well, but we all have an occasional bad night. It didn\\'t get better on Wednesday, and went downhill from there. I had difficulty falling asleep, kept waking up about every hour and then was awake at 3 am and unable to go back to sleep for a t least 1.5 hours. By Friday, I was taking a natural supplement supposed to help sleeping, and over the weekend I tried a sleeping pill. Nothing was helping. There had to be a cause for such a dramatic change, but nothing had changed in my life - no extra stress or illness, no change in diet, exercise or medications. The only thing that entered my life on Tuesday was the Fitbit. I took it off my wrist on Monday afternoon and put it away. I slept well Monday night and again last night.\\xa0\\xa0I am a rational person, not prone to panic; I don\\'t believe that\\xa0cell phones are causing brain tumors, etc., but \\xa0there is no way around it - it was my Fitbit that caused my insomnia. And I don\\'t believe it was just the discomfort from wearing it on my wrist. Considering the dramatic change in my sleep, it must have been something emitted by the device or the wireless communication going on between the tracker and my phone.\\xa0I haven\\'t been able to bring myself to put the Fitbit back on my wrist, even during the day, not knowing what it was that was affecting my sleep. I am curious if anyone else has experienced a similar problem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnswered!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGo to the Best Answer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a name for an unhealthy obsession with achieving perfect sleep: orthosomnia. It was coined by researchers from Rush University Medical School and Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in\\xa0a 2017 case study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.\\xa0This insomnia usually happens because the user gets to hung up on checking their Fitbit data, rather than relaxing.Here is one users experience\\xa0.\\xa0As several users pointed out, the first thing they do is check their sleep score. The tracker, instead of being a tool, has now become a mini god and the user is nervous trying to make the tracker happy. This of course will add frustration and cause sleep problems.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nView best answer in original post\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the way, I am not a jogger - don\\'t know where that came from.

I didn’t put it back on right when I got home from the hospital, I used it for the first time last night. I’ve been amazed at how well I’ve been sleeping the past few weeks and thought the surgery helped that somehow. Last night was terrible. Was fitful and woke several times. Was sluggish and tired this morning, even overslept. I’m keeping it off for now. Will try it again in a couple of weeks, but I am pretty sure the FitBit is disturbing my sleep.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI agree, I take the fitbit off at night and only wear it during the day. The light on the charge 2 wakes me up so sleep better without it!\\n\\n\\nOlana, \\xa0yes. I am like you. Never had anything like a fitbit before. 3 nights not sleeping and my husband noticed it started when I got my fitbit. Alta HR. I took it off and then slept normally. Nothing else happened to change my sleep. It must be the fitbit and me. Darn.\\n\\n\\nYes! I have been having issues ever since I switched to the tracker 2.the older, smaller version didn’t seem to bother me. I am sensitive to light when sleeping and the super bright green light that flashes with every movement was driving me crazy. I took it off a week ago and have slept better ever since.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI, too have found that the fitbit was messing with my sleep. Unfortunately, it took months to figure it out, since some other things were going on at the same time, so I didn\\'t attribute the problem was the fitbit. I was waking up every morning thinking every devil in hell was inside me. Of course I didn\\'t think it could be the fitbit. I tried everything to feel better. I finally took it off and now feel so much better! I know a lot of people aren\\'t affected by it, but there are some, and I am one of them.\\n\\n\\nI’ve had a Fitbit for years and recently noticed a friend (who had just got one) has much better sleep than me from comparing sleep analysis. Hers is mainly dark blue whereas I’m usually spending most of the night in light blue. I assumed it was just she’s a better sleeper than me. But when I take it off I have a much deeper more satisfying sleep (sadly just don’t have the analysis to review!). Another colleague visited his chiropractor and was surprised to find he was stronger in his arm when he took them fitbit off?!?!? Very odd but something isn’t going nowhere on with the Bluetooth and the nervous system\\n\\n\\nI couldn\\'t sleep for the first two nights when I had my Charge 2 to monitor my sleep. From third night, I took it off, then the sleep back to normal. Didn\\'t try it again.\\n\\n\\nI was just talking to my wife about.\\xa0 As I have not slept for more than 6 hours (and I am happy when that happens) for a long, long time.\\xa0 I am fearing that this may be true.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI’m so glad I found this message board. The last two months I was correcting my sleep cycle and was sleeping better than ever. I decided to track it because I just felt that good about how I slept. But every time I sleep with my Fitbit versa, I sleep terribly. I just can’t get comfortable or stay relaxed long enough to sleep. I’m going to skip it tonight and see if that helps.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m experiencing the same thing. My sleep had reached the best it has ever been. I was given a fitbit as a gift. Since the fit bit usage my sleep has declined. I was thinking maybe it\\'s the bright light\\xa0 it emits at night but now I\\'m concerned that it\\'s both the light AND the EMF\\'s. I\\'m not sure but I will experiment.... alternate\\xa0 a few days of usage.\\xa0I do know that studies show that sleep can be disturbed by bright light even shining Behind the knees on the skin only!. (Studies regarding jet lag, circadian rhythm etc.)I was wanting to know if other users have discovered a problem with the light by itself??\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI love my Fitbit, but, I too, have been experiencing bouts of insomnia while wearing it at night.\\xa0 i think what happens is that if it takes too long for me to fall asleep or if I wake a few hours after falling asleep, I become anxious about what the Fitbit stats will say in the morning.\\xa0 So I have decided that unless I truly need to wake up at a specific time, I will remove the Fitbit at night and alleviate the stress of those \"dang\" statistics.\\xa0 I like the gentle wake-up of the vibrating watch but will go without for a few nights and see if my overall sleep improves.\\n\\n\\nI am really glad to have found this link. I just bought myself a fitbit charge 3 about a week and a half ago. I wear this device while sleeping and my sleeps have been terrible every night since. I am interested in tracking not only my activity but my sleep patterns and how they relate to my heart rate. I normally will have one bad, that is restless, night of sleep per week, at the most. Every night is really bad ever since, with little to no deep sleep and waking up several time over the night. I will go to bed tonite not wearing my fitbit to see what happens regarding my sleep, though there will be no data.\\n\\n\\nOlana, I\\'ve experienced the same sleep problem while wearing my new Fitbit. Although I loved tracking my REM, Deep and light sleep, it\\'s not worth it. Reluctantly removed the watch last night and had a normal night\\'s sleep.\\n\\n\\nI am having the same results.

       " '\\nAccording to\\xa0this article by Fitbit, most users earn a sleep score between 72-83. \\xa0Since the score is out of 100, and the display on iOS shows up as a circle that I have failed to close, I am wondering if anyone has ever actually earned a sleep score of 100. \\xa0 Is it actually possible to achieve this goal? \\xa0If so, how? \\xa0Were strong sleeping pills involved? \\xa0\\xa0(Edit to add: No, I do not take sleeping pills, I do not drink, and I do not want to take any substances. \\xa0I made this comment because I believe the scoring system sets an impossible standard. \\xa0And no, I am not buying premium just to see the math).\\xa0Honestly, even on a night when I slept for over 10 hours with plenty of deep sleep, my “score” was still only an 84. \\xa0It seems impossible to earn above the low 80s.\\xa0It feels like I am taking one of those impossible “weed-out” classes in college where nobody earns above a B- and the prof doesn’t give As on principle. \\xa0Is that the model here? \\xa0\\xa0If it’s not really possible to get a sleep score of 100, why is the sleep score configured to look like an achievable “goal” from which we have somehow fallen short? \\xa0If we are doing everything in our power to get good sleep, and we still cannot earn 100 or even 90, what’s the point of it? \\xa0Fitbit has been so useful for helping me to set and reach goals. \\xa0Why create a goal that is inherently unattainable?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve achieved over 90 one time since it was implemented.\\xa0 For reference, I don\\'t set any alarm, so my wake up is \"natural\".\\xa0 The single 91 I scored was after a night where I got 8 hours 19 minutes restful sleep (9 hours and 8 minutes total sleep).\\xa0My actual average restful is between 6h30m and 7h15m.\\xa0 I generally score between 80 and 84.\\xa0 I\\'m totally fine with that, but the stupid scoring implies I could sleep 15-20% better each night, which doesn\\'t seem possible, as the score seems to value time spent restful sleeping the most, and no way will I ever be able to achieve over 8 hours restful regularly (meaning likely over 9 total) - nor would I want to.\\xa0However, I\\'ve given up on the score being useful just today.\\xa0 I\\'ve been working on my poor posture lately, and may have overdid it a bit on Sunday - as yesterday I had a bit more back pain that usual (it\\'s gradually going down, but some days I maybe exercise a bit too much or sit poorly a bit too much, still).\\xa0 My restful sleep when I woke up this morning checked in at 4h51m (I was up later than usual as I was just uncomfortable) and my total was only 5h13m.\\xa0 I felt like hot trash, and needed a 90 minute nap about 4 hours later.\\xa0 However I was scored at an 80 - which is simply laughable.\\xa0I\\'ve only had one other night with such poor sleep since the score came into being, and it was rightly scored much lower (66 - though I would have rated it lower), and so many much better nights of sleep scored in the 70\\'s.\\xa0I don\\'t see the point of the Sleep Score at all.\\xa0 In my 48 years I\\'ve never slept as much as it seems to indicate I need to in order to get an excellent night\\'s sleep, and have no need nor desire to start now.\\xa0 And when it scores bad nights as \"good\", it\\'s number becomes useless.\\n\\n\\n@Yennnny\\xa0 \\xa0First, if you don\\'t mind, I am going to move this thread to the Sleep Better forum. \\xa0You bring up some very interesting observations. \\xa0I think this thread will generate more interest and responses in the Sleep Better forum than in the iOS app forum.\\xa0This\\xa0Help article\\xa0explains what is used in calculating a sleep score. \\xa0Premium users get more specific information about each component of their sleep score.\\xa0Sleep changes with age. \\xa0Recently, my daughter sent me her sleep stage graph that showed zero minutes awake. \\xa0Not typical for me. \\xa0I suspect there are higher scores out there, especially from those users who are out right after their heads hit the pillow and open their eyes the next morning.\\xa0Strong sleeping pills are not the answer. \\xa0Some sleeping pills interfere with deep and REM sleep. \\xa0Likewise, more than moderate alcohol use interferes with sleep stages.\\xa0The Fitbit\\xa0Blog\\xa0has articles that discuss improving sleep. \\xa0The Blog is just one of many sources available to help with sleep. \\xa0\\xa0Last night I got my highest score ever, an 86 on 7 hrs 23 mins of sleep. \\xa0I had much less time awake, a lot of deep and REM sleep and a lot of time with my sleeping heart rate less than my RHR.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nLaurie | Maryland, USAVersa 3, Luxe, Aria 2 | iOS | Mac OS Take a look at the Fitbit help site for further assistance and information.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, summing up, 100 is not achievable? Then why the sleep score is designed to set unrealistic standards that push users into anxiety and depression?\\n\\n\\nI regularly get sleep scores of 90 and 91. I have FitBit premium and the score is calculated as such: \\xa0Time Asleep counts for 50 points, Deep+REM count for 25 points, and sleeping heart rate counts for 25. I scored a 91 when I was asleep for 8:45 (46/50 points),\\xa0received 2 hours of Deep+2 hours of Rem (23/25 points), had my sleeping heart rate at 87% below my resting heart rate (22/25 points). Improvements in each of these 3 categories would get you to a score of 100.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW UP: I am in awe how our bodies adapt and respond to changes. \\xa0Due only to persistence and my sleep research, I offer this progress update to those interested in the science of healthy sleep habits. \\xa0My restoration sleep score continues to improve (21 to 23 out of 25) which in turn affects the overall sleep score with daily averages now in the 90 to 95 range. \\xa0I am committed more than ever to adapt everything I have gleaned so far into a lifetime of healthy habits towards restful sleep. Thank you Fitbit for participating and being a vital part of my overall healthy lifestyle.\\xa0Excellent answer Squatticus.I subscribed to Fitbit premium to use as a guide to help me set and achieve better health goals. My rationale, I would rather spend $6.67 per month for Fitbit premium in order to stave off hundreds of dollars per month in prescription drugs for the rest of my life. I find the sleep data and analysis plus the other guides that come with the Fitbit premium quite useful.Having said that, as far as the sleep score is concerned; for me, it is simply another tool to help me achieve improved health by developing healthier lifestyle choices. I don’t view the sleep score as competitive or some race I have to win. \\xa0For me personally, I ascertained my biggest hurdle was the restoration subset of the sleep score which is based on the sleeping heart rate. \\xa0Because of the data from my sleep score analysis, I discovered by lowering my resting heart rate and my sleeping heart rate naturally through interval training and breathing exercises, I improved my sleep restoration. For the first time last night, my sleeping heart rate was below my resting heart rate 65% of the time I was asleep, which gave me a score of 21 out of 25. A huge improvement since I started tracking my sleep in the Fitbit app. This small progress is definitely worth the $6.67 per month.Don’t get me wrong, the Fitbit premium is not a solution for everyone but it certainly has shed some light on areas of fitness and health I wasn’t even aware of. It is my wish we all can achieve our overall health goals through our sweet dreams...\\xa0\\n\\n\\t“A person who resolves to begin regular morning exercises usually does so not because he already has physical fitness but in order to get something he does not have. Once one has something he can be anxious to keep it; previous to that, he is anxious to get it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Because of the data from my sleep score analysis, I discovered by lowering my resting heart rate and my sleeping heart rate naturally through interval training and breathing exercises, I improved my sleep restoration.\"\\xa0Thanks for sharing that observation and your success. It is interesting to see that the sleep score provides actionable information for improving sleep beyond just staying in bed longer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI had a Sleep Score 90 recently where it was typically around the 80\\'s..\\xa0 For others here I have Premium so I can analyse these scores.\\xa0Why ?.... I had a walking, \"over use\" issue in my calf muscles and my RHR shot up to 61. The sleep\\xa0 Restoration results had my sleeping HR at 95% under the elevated RHR.. I have genetic low HR..\\xa0See this link which reported an odd error about sleep\\xa0 but the graph is there on the 11th December with a score of 22/25..\\xa0@Baltoscott\\xa0 and @LZeeW\\xa0 I feel the mathematics is incorrect in this case because I lowered the RHR after physio after 3 days and it\\'s remained constant at 57 bpm now, on the way to 52 again..\\xa0 The sleeping HR is back to 40-50% under the new RHR which gives me a score of 17/25.. Overall beck to a Sleep Score of 80\\xa0\\xa0@SilviaFitbit is handling the error in the link and I\\'m hoping there is more thought on the RHR and Sleeping HR.\\xa0 Or, maybe, I\\'m just the genetic odd one, and come outside the normal distribution bell curve of the Fitbit population.\\xa0But the Sleep scoring works for me with the restless nights, because in Melbourne (Australia) we are having our typical weather of 4 seasons in a week, except rain..\\xa0 It will be 44oC (111oF)\\xa0 today and 21oC (70oF) tomorrow, It was 41oC (106oF) 2 days ago and the same drop again yesterday.\\n\\nColin:Victoria, AustraliaIonic (OS 4.2.1, 27.72.1.15), Android App 3.45.1, Premium, Phone Sony Xperia XA2, Android 9.0\\n\\n\\n\\nFitbit is an analytical model of how you use your body.\\xa0 And all models are wrong, but some models are useful.\\xa0 So, a\\xa0better question is why are people getting depressed over a device that generates some information based on your heart rate and hand movements?\\xa0 It\\'s not an EEG machine.\\xa0 It\\'s not even an EKG machine.\\n\\xa0\\nI would like everyone here to use this platform as a useful tool that helps you take better care of yourself, and not as a video game to be won.\\n\\xa0\\nModerator edit:\\xa0 word choice\\n\\n\\n100 is achievable. I already laid out how the sleep score is calculated and what metrics need to be improved to achieve 100.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI think the question really is, does anyone every actually achieve it? Have you?\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Since we are told that sleep decreases in quality by age, I wish Fitbit would show age adjusted sleep scores in addition to what they are doing now. It may be that some of us who are in our 70s or 60s or 80s and have lower sleep scores or actually doing quite well compared to the population of people their age.Wish someone from Fitbit would answer this!\\n\\n\\nThere is a benchmark section, which will tell you for your age range what a typical night\\'s sleep looks like for your age group.\\n\\n\\nStill wondering if Squatticus - or anyone else - has actually achieved 100?\\xa0 Knowing the metrics is one thing.\\xa0 Knowing if 100 is achievable is a separate matter.\\xa0 And knowing specifically what steps to take to achieve it is yet another.\\xa0(Metrics= If you have $100 and multiply by 10, you will have $1000.\\xa0 But what steps do you take to multiply it, has it ever been achieved by anyone taking those steps, and is it achievable to most anyone who takes those steps?).\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFOLLOW UP: I am in awe how our bodies adapt and respond to changes. \\xa0Due only to persistence and my sleep research, I offer this progress update to those interested in the science of healthy sleep habits. \\xa0My restoration sleep score continues to improve (21 to 23 out of 25) which in turn affects the overall sleep score with daily averages now in the 90 to 95 range. \\xa0I am committed more than ever to adapt everything I have gleaned so far into a lifetime of healthy habits towards restful sleep. Thank you Fitbit for participating and being a vital part of my overall healthy lifestyle.\\xa0How were you able to lower your sleeping HR? I’ve lowered my RHR by 10 over the past month in a half but my sleeping HR is still well above my RHR for the first 1/2-1/3 of the night (sometimes more). I understand lowering your RHR will help but so far my sleeping HR hasn’t changed. I also get that it’s been a short amount of time since I started watching this and it takes time. I would think that lowering my RHR by so much already that it would have made some kind of difference. I’ve had 2 nights where my sleeping HR was higher for less than 1/2 the night. I analyzed those days and see nothing that was different on those days than any other. I must be missing something here.I have also done some research but I’ve not had much success in finding ways to lower both sleeping HR and REM sleep. I tend to get way more REM than average and less light sleep due to that, even though one of meds is supposed to suppress REM. I did skip that 2 nights and there was no change in REM sleep, I just had muscle spasms for several days after which made it harder to exercise those days.\\xa0A side note: I do not drink, I have chronic pain so am limited on cardio workouts (I do walk and am able to spend some of the time walking faster in short bursts to bring it up, but never to peak), I’m 5’5” and 157lbs with a 26.2 BMI down from 28.6 (still dropping fat and gaining muscle). I’m sure the fat loss will help too. Unfortunately I do need medication to keep my pain in check. I have dropped by 50% in the past year, which helps other areas of my life, wish I could live on nothing but it’s not doable if I don’t want to be home bound.\\xa0What kind of breathing exercises do you do that have helped you? I know they may not help me but I’d like to give it a shot. I do 3 mins of inhale 5, exhale 8 nightly before bed. It helps me fall asleep faster and I do feel better if I don’t forget to do them, which is very rare.\\xa0Any advise or reading references would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your post. It gives me hope that it’s possible to lower my SHR!\\n\\n\\n\\xa0I regularly get sleep scores of 90 and 91. I have FitBit premium and the score is calculated as such: \\xa0Time Asleep counts for 50 points, Deep+REM count for 25 points, and sleeping heart rate counts for 25. I scored a 91 when I was asleep for 8:45 (46/50 points),\\xa0received 2 hours of Deep+2 hours of Rem (23/25 points), had my sleeping heart rate at 87% below my resting heart rate (22/25 points). Improvements in each of these 3 categories would get you to a score of 100.\\xa0Same question as I asked Austin...How were you able to lower your sleeping HR. My RHR is lower by 10 but there’s no change in sleeping HR. Please see my reply to Austin for more details.\\xa0Any ideas are welcome! I’d love your input since it sounds like you’ve found the sweet spot!\\xa0btw I’m not looking at this as a game to be won. I’d just like to figure out how to get less REM and how to lower my sleeping HR. I do well in the amount of time asleep and all other areas, it’s just my sleeping HR is high and my REM tends to be higher than average. I rarely go to bed and wake at different times. I may sleep an extra hour on Saturday mornings every few weeks but that’s only 1-2x a month max. I did forget to add that I’m currently a 43yrs female with over 10,000 steps a day. I consider myself moderately active by walking and doing resistance training 3-5x a week. I’m unable to run or jog but try to do spurts of speed walking while in my daily walks. Those are not as I’d like but better than it used to be. Still working on increasing the duration of spurts to work my heart a little more. Never expect it to be on high end for long due to pain issues stopping me from any jarring exercise but do want to spend more time in the middle area while exercising.\\xa0Thanks for your comment as well, you both have given me hope that better sleep is possible!\\n\\n\\nOver the last month external influences have affected my RHR.. Mainly th fluctuating Melbourne weather and temperatures. On high temperature sleep nights.. (we don\\'t sleep with the aircons on), my RHR stabilized at 58 for 3 days and a week earlier, when it was a \"blanket\" night to sleep it went down to 52..\\xa0Over that time my average sleep score is 83 and a peak of 90.. The image below shows how I lose sleep score.\\xa0 Because it uses yesterday\\'s RHR I suffer in the numbers.. Fortunately this measure is only 25% of the total score.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nColin:Victoria, AustraliaIonic (OS 4.2.1, 27.72.1.15), Android App 3.45.1, Premium, Phone Sony Xperia XA2, Android 9.0\\n\\n\\n\\nThe highest I\\'ve managed to score is an 89, and the lowest I\\'ve scored was a 51. My average tends to rest around 87. I do have premium, so I can see the breakdown. As long as I hit my sleep goal (6 hours), my scores seems to stay above 85. The next important piece seems to be how much time is spent with my heart rate below my average resting heart rate for that day. After that seems to be how much time I spent awake. I\\'m unsure how to raise the third category because it\\'s based on how much deep and REM sleep you get. I always seem to score 20-22 out of 25 on a normal night. I pretty much always hit the \"benchmark\" for the percentage of time spent in each category, but my deep and REM tend to be at the bottom end. My light sleep is practically always at the very top of its benchmark, so it may be that it values deep and REM sleep over light sleep. How much you toss and turn at night also seems to be a factor, but I don\\'t see a significant difference caused by it. The app does talk about its breakdown, and what it says is pretty similar to what I\\'ve noticed. I think, to have a \\'perfect\\' score, you have to score 0% on their restlessness, get a LOT of deep and REM sleep, hit your sleep goal, and wake up very very little. Possibly not at all. I wish I had my Fitbit on when I went into my coma in January. It lasted 27 hours, and I would\\'ve loved to see how they broke down my sleep score for that.\\n\\n\\nI think the standard is supposed to be in the 80s. 90-100 is marked as \"excellent,\" so I think it\\'s supposed to be those extremely good nights of sleep that people don\\'t have near as often. If they made 100 the \\'normal\\' amount of sleep, then they wouldn\\'t be able to show when you had a REALLY good night of sleep. Though it does seem that they should bump it up a little seeing as how 100 is likely impossible without going into a short coma.\\n\\n\\nWhat I am about to share with you\\xa0works for me. My disclaimer is that you please clear any physical exertion beyond your normal levels with a qualified professional.\\xa0Before I start, allow me to share this thought I discovered years ago which made an impression on me at the time and still speaks volumes today,\\xa0“A person who resolves to begin regular morning exercises usually does so not because he already has physical fitness but in order to get something he does not have. Once one has something he can be anxious to keep it; previous to that, he is anxious to get it.”My passion for fitness exceeds 40 years. \\xa0I taught aerobics back in the day of leg warmers until running became the “in” thing to talk about and do. So naturally I had to become a runner. Fast forward to today, I am now retired and I try to maintain a sensible routine that includes the four components of fitness: cardio, strength training, flexibility, and nutrition. About 20 years ago I stumbled on Phil Campbell’s Sprint 8 for my cardio, just 20 minutes a day. (Here’s a link to describe the theory:\\xa0https://sprint8.com/the-workout/). An interval type workout is extremely beneficial for strengthening the heart muscle which in turn lowers the RHR. The Sprint 8 can be adjusted to your current level of fitness and gradually increased over time.Strength training (not bodybuilding or weightlifting) keeps my major muscle groups in check. I do no more than ten repetitions each using handheld weights for the\\xa0major skeletal muscle groups forming the upper body which are the abdominal, pectoral, deltoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, biceps, and triceps.\\xa0The major skeletal muscle groups of the lower body are the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, and gluteus.\\xa0I always work both sides of a muscle group so as not to cause injury in tearing a muscle due to a lack of resilience in an underworked muscle.Flexibility is important to keep the tendons and ligaments structurally aligned to support the entire skeletal system. Flexibility\\xa0is the range of motion in a joint or group of joints or the ability to move joints effectively through a complete range of motion. Flexibility\\xa0training includes stretching exercises\\xa0to lengthen the muscles.\\xa0Nutrition is the fitness glue and is more than a fad diet with a scale. I chose to go vegan three years ago and I limit my intake of salt, no refined sugar, and no processed foods. When my sodium intake is high, I notice a correlating increase in my RHR for that day. To keep the critical food naysayers at bay I simply tell them my food choices are the result of a heart condition. \\xa0The heart condition doesn’t have to be a bad thing [wink and a smile].OK, let me summarize and I apologize for rambling but our RHR is the result of all of the above. The whole idea is to train your heart to work smarter not harder. Throw in deep breathing exercises to train your diaphragm and lungs to disperse the ever important oxygen to your blood cells and major organs and you are on the right path to a healthier lifestyle. I breath deep (nose breathing not mouth breathing) whenever I am not talking; deep nose breathing is an acquired habit. Most people tend to be shallow mouth breathers and bypasses the all important function of the nose which filters out contaminants and warms the air before it enters the lungs. Last but not least, I try to maintain a daily 10,000+ step regimen. \\xa0Oh and the best part of staying healthy is achieving good mental health, reduced stress, and low blood pressure sans prescription meds.\\xa0Thank you for asking the question and thank you for reading this post. May all your steps be heart healthy...\\n\\n\\t“A person who resolves to begin regular morning exercises usually does so not because he already has physical fitness but in order to get something he does not have.

I then stopped wearing it and the dreams stopped. I recently found it and thought I would give it another go and wore it for the first time last night. The dreams returned hence googling to see if there are other reports on this and found your post I certainly believe the fitbit is responsible .\\n\\n\\nI stopped using my fitbit he two years ago due to vivid dreams and nightmares.\\xa0 I recently thought I would give it another go and they have started again .\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIt is 12:22 at night and just woke up for the second night in a row from a crazy nightmare and this is the second time I have worn this to bed. When I woke up it was the first thing I thought of was to take it off. I’m not sleeping with this anymore.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHi Heather, It is quite worrying and think more research into fitbit and\\xa0 dreaming needs to be done. I know plenty of people who have fitbits and don't have the dreams so it seems it is only a few of us affected this way.\\xa0Sent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nI started using my fitbit alta HR 10 days ago. I've had very vivid dreams, and in almost all cases nightmares, 7 out of 10 days. I NEVER remember dreams, and may have a nightmare I remember once every couple of years. I can recount all the nightmares during the last week with precise detail. I searched google to see if I was the only one experiencing this, and clearly I am not.\\xa0I will continue to use and then stop use if this persists. It is difficult to theorize what in the Fitbit device might be causing this.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHi , Fitbit' s response to me was not to wear it at night! I have found that even if i wear in the day but take it off at night I still dream but the dreams are not as vivid and like you I am not usually a vivid dreamer.I wish they would do some research on this. I don't suffer with headaches but some people are suffering with migraines when wearing so it seems to me that wearing the fitbit triggers something in certain peoples brains and if I wear the R&D department at fitbit I would want to find out what could be doing this. I do not know how to get Fitbit to take this as a serious side effect or to to find out how many people this affects or if something is awry with our brains!!SaleghSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThank you Salegh. I agree with you that more research needs to be done. It’s either some type of electromagnetic frequency that messes with the brain or potentially, the light emitted by the heart rate monitor if the device is not perfectly glued to the skin. It could be psychological, but I truly doubt it. Either way, I will keep evaluating and will post any updates.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nI also had a nightmares a few days ago.

I firmly believe it is due to the flashing light pulses from the heart rate monitor. If the device is not perfectly glued to the skin (I wear it more loose to bed) and you happen to have your Fitbit hand close to your eyes while you sleep, it's easy to see how the flashing lights could affect your sleep. It is easy to see the pulsating, green lights at night. From what I've researched, it is well documented that flashing, high frequency lights cause lucid dreams. This is my strongest hypothesis thus far.\\xa0See below for one simple reference to light flashes causing lucid dreams, searches in google constantly reference this technique.https://lucid.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Initiated_Lucid_Dream\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThank you for this, I am going to try again with the fitbit on tighter as I did loosen it at night too.

I have had a heart issue known as preventricular contractions and my cardiologist sent me to a Sleep Clinic for one night and they told me I had sleep apnea despite the fact that my fiance has never once mentioned that I stop breathing and so I was a little suspicious because the Sleep Clinic also rents out CPAP machines. I am not a good sleeper in any case and I don\\'t really know how to read this chart because it says variations in green are minor variations but the minor variations look fairly major and it might be possible to have a minor form of sleep apnea which might be remedied with a CPAP machine. If anyone has any thoughts with my charts please share and post yours. This is not personal information so I don\\'t know why anyone would care.\\xa0\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\n\\n\\nIf you want others to post their charts you should probably post yours first no?

I specifically got it to track my sleep. I never get a very deep sleep, I may be insomniac too, always am fatigued. I do have other health issues that contribute to that but my gut has been telling me there is something not right about my sleeping. I\\'ve not being diagnosed as having sleep apnea but having many yellow fluctuations in my graph maybe it\\'s a possibility. I\\'m not sure how to.post the graph but it saw somewhere that you can\\'t post an image until you post at least once so will try that 😊\\n\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\n\\n\\nMy graph looks a lot like yours. This is my first post so I will try the screen shot after. It\\'s been like this as long as I\\'ve been measuring. I\\'m not sure how I didn\\'t notice before. I have excessive fatigue. I\\'m going to bring it up to my doctor for sure.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMine look like this and I am wondering if I have sleep apnea as well.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI just read that it\\'s an android update issue and several people are seeing the same with version 3.64. I\\'m still following up as I do have other sleep apnea symptoms.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nGreat, I will remain optimistic then 😊 thank you\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s \"insurance normal\" to have an AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea-Index, or number of apneas (breathing pause) and hypopneas (breathing much slower but no pause) per hour of sleep) of 5 or less per hour.\\xa0 It\\'s an \"insurance normal\" because AHI of greater than 5 on a sleep study is required for Medicare to cover treatment and essentially all other public & private US insurance use the same standard. Probably 3 or less is ideal for treatment and many people would be lower than this. The Fitbit breathing chart wouldn\\'t tell you directly anything about your AHI because even with sleep apnea your blood O2 won\\'t start dropping significantly unless or until your apnea is severe.\\xa0 Fitbit doesn\\'t precisely determine blood O2, just level of variation and an overall estimate of % for the entire night. With the old graph, I never had any variations outside of low. With the new graph, every night I have lots of yellow spikes even though I wear a CPAP to bed each night.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tSense, One, Flex, Charge 2, Blaze, Ionic, Aria\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2003Yours are all in the green zone. Mine spike to the yellow zone a few times a night. I don’t have any sleep apnea symptoms.Thanks for sharing yours too (everyone who did)! Now looking at the date of this conversation was 6 mos. ago, but I’m grateful to see the comparisons.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDo you know if you snore? I was tested years ago and found out that I have mild sleep apnea. I never got around to treating it because some life circumstances got in the way, but I\\'m finally going to a sleep clinic in October.My sleep apnea shows up on my FitBit charts only a couple times a week, if that. When it does, it\\'s about once or twice a night. Sleep apnea can still cause cardiovascular and cognitive issues even without daytime sleepiness, so it might be worth it to get it checked out if that\\'s what your charts look like considering mine barely register anything. My apnea occurs mostly during REM sleep.\\xa0\\n',\n",

If that is the case, the sleep score discounts the time in light sleep. So it doesn\\'t mean anything.\\xa0\\xa0Second, I want to know whether using the HRV is equivalent to using the \"electroencephalogram to\\xa0detect\\xa0brain activity along with other systems to monitor eye and muscle activity\"?

If something cannot be verified then it could be just random number given and it would mean exactly the same. Sleep score is just another made-up metric not backed by any science.\\xa0Your second question is very interesting and there is a lot of research done discussing such correlation (it is really interesting topic).

That is part of my life. The sleep algorithm built into the sleep function trashes the sleep that I had before getting up to do my business. The sleep data that the app is showing underestimates the amount of sleep that I am actually getting. If I were a conspiracy theorist I would say that Fitbit is deliberately giving every customer the idea that they are getting much less sleep than they actually are getting.\\xa0\\xa0The explanations for the sleep analysis does not dig into the facts of the matter, things like how you correlate the heart beat data with the brain wave activity is nonexistent. That is the basis of your justification of doing this kind of analysis using a substtute measure, and yet the explanation is ambiguous and the justification is: You just have to trust us.\\xa0\\xa0Really not science and very duplicitous.\\n\\n\\n@pwung0327, thank you very much for your reply!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nI\\'m sorry for any inconvenience caused, your comments haven\\'t gone unnoticed and be sure they are very important to us.

I also take issue with the fact that the reports ignore chunks of sleep data because I had to get up to go to the bathroom and I am having to log in those times because the sensor stop recording. This isn\\'t why I paid to get the data.\\n\\n\\nHello\\xa0@hawkmeister, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for your input!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@pwung0327, currently, it is expected that when you wake up or get up at night your Fitbit device will stop recording your Sleep Activity, therefore; your Sleep stages. When you go back to Sleep, then it might start a 2nd Sleep log but take into consideration that this happens when your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep.\\n\\xa0\\nAs a workaround, on the Mobile Fitbit App, you can begin a sleep log by going into your Sleep tile and clicking on the plus (+) sign. Choose “Begin Sleep Now” and then whenever you wake up, just click on the “I’m Awake” button to stop logging. Therefore; this options prevents Sleep Stages and Sleep Score to be received.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThank you very much for your feedback!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nSee you around.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am doing that now, logging the missing sleep. My question to you is: why do I need to do that? The system can retieve my sleep data from the Fitbit during that time when I have not rested for an hour continuously, why cut that out of the reporting and making me, the customer to retrieve it by hand?\\n\\n\\n@pwung0327, the situation is that your Fitbit device automatically detects your movements. For this reason, when you wake up or get up at night, your Fitbit device will finish the Sleep tracking and it will start recording a second log after it detects that there hasn\\'t been any movement. This is expected.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nI\\'ll be around.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy biggest problem with sleep (and Fitbit tracking my sleep) is I wake up in the middle of the night, usually around 3:00 AM.\\xa0 I\\'ve taken to working a puzzle such as SODUKO until my eyes get heavy.\\xa0 I then roll over and fall asleep again.Fitbit records this as two separate sleep cycles.\\xa0 Sometimes the second sleep cycle is short (about 2 hours) and I get no sleep score for it.\\xa0 Sometimes the cycle is long enough that I get two sleep scores for the night, but both will typically be somewhat low numbers such as 60.Is there anyway to resolve the sleep score average for the night?\\xa0 I tend to ignore the sleep score due to this and work with just the total number of hours of sleep.\\xa0 I use the formula of total number of hours asleep divided by the total number of hours in bed to get a percentage of my sleep time.\\xa0 80% is believed to be a healthy number.\\xa0Thanks\\n\\n\\nHello\\xa0@Joe.FIT\\xa0Welcome to the community forums!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThank you very much for the detailed information!

Indeed, I have asked time and again for proof, in the form of a published and juried paper correlating the Fitbit classification of the sleep stages through the heartrates with the brain wave studies which we assume to be the reference. No response.\\xa0And the moderator\\'s attempt to obfuscate the issues that is plaguing this function is frustrating. They know they have an issue with the population that gets up in the middle of the night and who are not getting accurate readings and all we get is: you should sleep better, like normal people. How condescending.I also just got a firmware update from Firbit, so I know they do updates on the devices, why not correct the problem through the firmware?

I sleep cycle disorder meaning I don’t cycle through stages and I wake up 7 to 8 times per night for no reason just to go back to sleep. It tells me I got great sleep because I got 45 minutes of deep sleep at the beginning of the night, 80 REM at the end, and a total “time asleep” of eight hours. Didn’t complete a single REM cycle, feel like crap, and could sleep another 3-4 in the morning.\\xa0It is a very basic algorithm, it has to be.\\xa0\\n',\n",

That typically happens at the end of REM.\\xa0I also think that I had more than 9 minutes of deep sleep based on the fact that I felt rested after waking up.\\xa0I am 77 years old in reasonable health.I use a Versa 2. I have a FitBit Premium subscription.My CPAP machine is a Phillips Respironics with a Dreamwear mask.Last night the CPAP said I had an AHI of 5.4.

My reports have been a good mix of REM, Light and Deep sleep. You can read more about how Fitbit calculates sleep and sleep stages, and also read tips for a better sleep here. \\xa0You may also want to check how tight or loose your Versa 2 is on your wrist. The\\xa0wristband should be snug but not constricting, a tight wristband restricts blood flow, potentially affecting the heart-rate signal ... which affects how sleep stages are interpreted.\\xa0\\xa0Hope this helps.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThanks Carol,I have had the Versa 2 fairly snug on my wrist.I will loosen it and see if that makes a difference.\\n\\n\\nCarol,\\xa0I loosened the strap one notch. No changes.I loosened another notch. Still no deep sleep recorded.If I loosen it more, it will slide along arm.\\xa0Maybe the fact that I do not see deep sleep is a combination of the fitbit algorithm for sleep stage detection and me personally. I usually sleep on my back. I will sometimes fall to sleep on my side, but I always wake up on my back.\\n\\n\\nI’m sorry the trouble shooting did not work for you,\\xa0@RichardMW\\xa0. You are very methodical. A question - Does your heart rate appear to be working correctly? Try carefully cleaning the contact points. Instructions are here.\\xa0\\xa0If you have not already done so, you may want to check out the Fitbit Help documentation regarding the estimated oxygen levels and the Help data regarding sleep stages-\\xa0\\xa0how they are calculated, and how to interpret your results.\\xa0\\xa0Finally, it never hurts to restart your Versa a couple times. Wish I could suggest more. Maybe other CPAP users will chime in with their experiences.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI had given up on my CPAP for close to a year. \\xa0When I started looking at my nighttime oxygen levels (a LOT of orange spikes), I got it out and started using it again- WOW! only a couple spikes in over a month.\\xa0-how is that reading for you?(I have a charge 3)\\n\\n\\nI recently started using a cpap with the same equipment. I'm experiencing the same issues... I wondered if others were experiencing that too.\\n\\n\\nThx for this post, I am in the same boat. Have been through several smart watches discovering various levels og insufficient deep sleep levels and now just started using fitbit.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOtdk,I am now using a\\xa0Resmed 10 with a Phillips Dreamwear mask.Phillips issued a worldwide recall last May for all their CPAP machines. They warned users to immediately\\xa0stop using them.\\xa0There was a big problem with sound reduction foam breaking down if used with a ozone cpap cleaner.Smaller problems for non-ozone users.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nYes! My sleep tracking rarely shows REM or deep sleep when I have my bipap on. I also have days where I wake up feeling like I slept well when wearing it but my fitbit show under 30 minutes of rem.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI have severe sleep apnea and am using a bi-pap machine. I was recording very little deep sleep. I'm 68 and have recently lost a lot of weight but still very little deep sleep. Rem and light sleep has been in the benchmark for my age group. I read about taking 3 mg of melatonin a couple hrs. before going to bed. It's helped. Took a few days but I'm recording much better deep sleep. Last night I had 1 hr. and 12 min. deep sleep. That's great for me and within the benchmark. Give it a try, might help.\\n\\n\\nTwo years late to the discussion but I wondered the same thing (which is of course how I came here :-). I have had a couple different Fitbit models and have had the same experience. I have compared nights I wore my CPAP and nights I didn't. I definitely see less deep sleep reported by my Fitbit when I wear my CPAP and maybe less REM as well. I also see lower reported estimated oxygen variation, tossing and turning, and sleeping heart rate.\\n\\n\\nI have been experiencing this as well!\\xa0I've been wearing a Fitbit to measure sleep for years (currently using a Sense), and my sleep scores were pretty good - averaging in the mid-80s and sleep stages within normal benchmarks. However I was feeling more and more exhausted during the day, in spite of these pretty decent scores. The HR and breathing variability numbers were spiking most nights so I underwent evaluation for apnea and found I have moderate obstructive apnea.\\xa0\\xa0I've been using a ResMed 11 CPAP machine since mid-August -- I find it very comfortable and have no trouble wearing it all night long. I have gone from 16 apnea events per hour to ZERO using this CPAP device, and I feel a million times better when I wake up and during the day, the difference in how I feel compared with before the CPAP is really extraordinary.\\xa0\\xa0However, my Fitbit scores rarely break 80 now, mostly due to reduced time in deep and rem sleep.\\xa0It does appear to be correctly tracking HR and respiration variability, because am not seeing any orange spikes any more like I did before the CPAP.\\xa0 I experimented with setting the sensitivity to high vs normal, but it hasn't made a noticeable difference.\\xa0 It really seems like wearing the CPAP is interfering with how the Sense tracks sleep stages.\\xa0\\xa0It's puzzling and a frustrating, and has led me to cancel my Premium Fitbit service, since I don't have confidence in the metrics anymore, given they don't seem to relate to my actual experience.\\xa0 I am sorry others are seeing this too, but it is a bit of a relief as well - I though I was going nuts.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHey\\xa0@AZLemur\\xa0, congratulations on getting zero ahi. That's huge. Isn't it amazing when you get a good nights sleep using the cpap? I felt so good when I got my cpap dialed in and was getting ahi's of 2 and below with some 0 event nights. I knew I was dragging during the day and for me headaches but had no idea how much better I could feel. I have to remember my Fitbit device is not a medical device and a cpap machine is, so I don't put much stock in my Fitbit over my cpap. ( but I still want to get a good score, lol.) I found my Fitbit is a great motivational tool for me and if I'm heading in the right direction re active minutes, steps etc. Take care.\\n\\n\\nYes!! \\xa0I’ve only been using my CPAP for 1 week and my sleep data is worse that before! \\xa0 Like you, my CPAP is showing a good record of sleep….\\xa0I use a Sense Fitbit and my oxygenation spikes are low but my overall oxygenation % for the night is super low…\\n\\n\\nSo, since I have been using the CPAP machine my sleep has been better and I feel much more awake and energetic during the day. I am also much more positive, but my Charge 5 has no idea how to record my sleep. Since using the CPAP, my Fitbit records between 1 and 3 hours of sleep maximum per night, whereas I allow for 9 hours and I am asleep for at least 7 of them.For clarity, my bedtime routine has not changed and previously Fitbit recorded between 6 and 8 hours per night. Now that I sleep better, the results are absolutely useless. Is anyone else experiencing this?\\n\\n\\nYep, mine just shows 30min of sleep in total\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nAs someone who has been interested in deep sleep, I was pleased when Fitbit rolled out the sleep stages. Over the last few weeks, my deep sleep has plummeted, and I\\'ve tried a few things to improve it. One in particular has worked really well, that I\\'d like to share.\\n\\xa0\\nBut first, what is deep sleep, and why is it important, especially to people engaging in fitness. Deep sleep is the most mysterious part of sleep, because we\\'re not awake, we\\'re not consciously dreaming. Really, there\\'s not much going on at all, mentally. And that\\'s important, to give us a break from thinking so we can process and integrate our experiences.In terms of physical health, deep sleep is critical. Potent hormones such a GH and IGF-1 are released during deep sleep. These hormones are linked to physical health as well as performance. When I don\\'t get enough deep sleep, my strength workouts really suffer. Interestingly enough, getting a small amount of overall sleep affects me less than getting 8 hours of sleep, but very little deep sleep. That\\'s how important it is.\\nI read a lot of articles and papers online about getting more deep sleep. But almost all of them were just generic advice on getting more and better sleep. They didn\\'t focus on deep sleep itself, which is what I\\'m trying to improve. So I began experimenting...\\n\\xa0\\nSince deep sleep is a kind of oblivion (from the mind\\'s perspective), there\\'s no real conscious way to make it happen. While there are many tricks to falling asleep, or inducing dreams, the realm of deep sleep seems less traveled.So what\\'s worked for me? First, is acknowledging I can\\'t consciously put myself into deep sleep, because the very nature of deep sleep is unconscious. This may seem obvious, but it was an important realization to me. Because deep sleep occurs near the beginning of the sleep cycle, before REM, I feel the \"getting to sleep\" portion of the night is the most important aspect of getting deep sleep.Recently, when I can\\'t sleep, I\\'ve taken to just getting out of bed, have some water, read a little. Just forget all about getting to sleep. Last night I went to sleep when ready, instead of when I should. I got less than 6 hours sleep, but my deep sleep was greatly increased. Today\\'s workout I hit two personal records (squat and overhead press), and felt fine afterwards, despite not much sleep. It will be interesting to see the relationship between amount of overall sleep compared to deep sleep. For now, my experience says the amount of deep sleep is critical to physical performance.Would love to hear other\\'s thoughts on the subject.Edit 2/24/2018:\\n\\nCompilation of tips and links from the first 8 Pages:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gartenberg_the_brain_benefits_of_deep_sleep_and_how_to_get_more_of_it?...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a great guy Shawn Stevenson.

Getting 10k steps isn’t just about getting the steps, it’s about carving out that time for yourself. So is disconnecting from electronics. When I take care of my mental self, I get deep sleep. I barely got any exercise over Christmas, but my sleep was excellent because my anxiety was low. That’s going to be different for each of us, but I think the core of it is the same - making time toward the end of each day to spend time doing the thing that makes us happy. For me, it’s keeping my caffeine consumption low during the day and then reading a book before I fall asleep. For someone else, it’s digging in the dirt. But what I heard on this forum is a lot of anxiety and not a lot of time carved out of the day to take care of our inner selves. That’s the greatest treat we can give ourselves these days - the gift of time for ourselves.

On an SSRI (Lexapro), but have no major other health issues. I\\'ve started to become concerned because my deep sleep statistics are far below the benchmark for women my age. On a normal night, I get between 25 minutes-1 hour of deep sleep. It\\'s usually either too small of a percentage to show, or about 12% of my total sleep. My REM statistics are normal and I sleep 6-7 hours a night, 8-9 on weekends.\\xa0What\\xa0could be causing this lack of deep sleep? Could I just be a lighter sleeper than most?\\xa0thanks for your help!!\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHi I\\'m in my 50s and only seem to get around 5 - 6 hrs sleep a night and only 11 - 13% showed as deep sleep but I had to get a new Fitbit charge 2 and now I appear to have no deep sleep at all! I\\'m not convinced it\\'s really all that accurate so I wouldn\\'t worry to much. If you feel fine when you wake up that\\'s the main thing 👍\\n\\n\\nHi Dave, \\xa0I absolutely agree with you on the importance of deep sleep. \\xa0I wish I knew how to get more. \\xa0Some nights I get 30 to 40 minutes deep sleep and have very little energy all day and then boom....I\\'ll have over and hour and a half and feel great and my endurance is greatly enhanced. \\xa0Good luck in your quest for a better nights sleep!\\n\\n\\nI am averaging only about 1 hour of deep sleep a night and this concerns me. I would like to know an average for about 7 and a half hours sleep.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m glad I clicked on this topic. The first night I used my Fitbit and tracked my sleep, I spent 10 minutes in Deep Sleep. The night before last, I spent 1 hour and 10 minutes in Deep Sleep. I spend most of my time in Light Sleep, followed by REM Sleep. It baffles me. But I\\'m glad I\\'m not alone. I think one of the things I need to start doing is disconnecting from electronic devices a few hours before bed. It\\'s very difficult but I\\'ll have to wean myself from them earlier and earlier each night.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI am with you in needing to disconnect from the electronics. \\xa0I\\'m not sure about how much deep sleep you actually need but my body tells me it is more that 30 - 40 minutes. \\xa0I feel ok if I get at least an hour but much less than that and I just feel tired all day. \\xa0I am going to try to go electronic free from 8:00 tonight and the next couple of nights and see if that helps. \\xa0 \\xa0I have been walking/jogging at 8:00 because it so hot here during the day. \\xa0I may have to start exercising at 6 am instead if the electronic fast doesn\\'t work. \\xa0Good luck finding better sleep!\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI am also a night exerciser due to the heat. Although, I do exercise indoors on my treadmill and Total Gym, I do wait until I lower my A/C at night. I\\'m also very much a night owl! I\\'m not sure if I can exercise in the mornings. Really doubtful. Good luck with stepping away from the electronics at 8pm. I\\'m going to try to step away earlier from my laptop but I will have the tv on. In fact, I go to sleep with the television on. Bad idea but I can\\'t really sleep without it.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a great guy Shawn Stevenson. He\\'s written a book called Sleep Smarter - it\\'s well worth a read. Also you can check him out on You Tube.\\xa0I\\'m finding it hard to get my 8 hours sleep - averaging at about 6:40. \\xa0Getting 50-60 min deep sleep.\\xa0They say if you go to bed at 10am, you get the optimum sleep and recovery etc.\\xa0Good luck!\\n\\n\\nUsing electronics at night definitely has an effect on sleep and deep sleep. I\\'ve used a freeware program on android and windows called F.lux. What it does is adjust the color spectrum of these devices to more naturally follow the changes of day and night.\\xa0Since then, I picked up a pair of blue-blocking glasses, that I wear while watching TV at night. They work really well.\\n\\nWork out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California\\n\\n\\n\\nI normally get less than 6 hours sleep a night.\\xa0 The problem with working two jobs with one having you get up at 3:30 am four days a week.\\xa0 My deep sleep on a good day is less than an hour.\\xa0 My more common time is about 10-15 minutes.\\xa0 I wake up constantly worried about not sleeping.\\xa0 Crazy, trying to get more sleep.\\xa0 Summer is the worst because it is light till 9 pm.\\xa0 Can\\'t get up and read when you are pushing sleep less than 6 to begin with.\\n\\n\\nThanks so much Dave, I downloaded the f lux on my mac!\\n\\n\\nThanks so much Dave for taking the time to share your great post. \\xa0I completely agree about the importance of deep sleep and have been researching trying \\xa0to figure out how to get more of it each night. \\xa0I\\'ve read and heard from more than a few sources that getting to bed before 10pm is recommended and I\\'d like to shift things around to start doing that. My routine/habit has been \\xa0staying \\xa0up to late (past midnight.. closer to 1:00am) and \\xa0the light from using cell/laptop surely is not helping.\\xa0It\\'s of comfort to be able to communicate with others who are on the same page. \\xa0🙂 \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI *think* I might have solved the riddle of how to get more deep sleep.\\xa0\\xa0I have noticed that the more strenuous physical activity that I get, the more deep sleep that I get.\\xa0\\xa0One day I did a lot of gardening and that night I got almost an hour of deep sleep. It didn\\'t register as \"steps\" because I was doing more bending than anything, but I did not meet the 10K step requirement. If I had, I might have been able to get more deep sleep. A couple of days ago, I got in my 10K steps and that night I got 1 hour and 9 minutes of deep sleep, which is the highest I have ever got since using my Fitbit Charge 2 (just got it about 3 weeks ago).\\xa0\\xa0So, I think that if we are able to get enough physical activity\\xa0in AND get\\xa0at least 10K steps in a day, we should be able to get more deep sleep. I\\'m starting to think that since we, as a society, move less than generations before us, that we are not getting enough deep sleep. Most of us have jobs where we are at the computer almost all day long (I\\'m one of them) and we do not get enough physical movement. It\\'s VERY hard for me to get in 10K steps in a day. But if you read the community board about how to sneak in extra steps, it really does work (e.g. parking your car further away, taking stairs instead of elevator, etc.).\\xa0\\xa0Just thought I\\'d share my findings so far.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI meant to say I got 1 hour and 19 minutes of deep sleep. I couldn\\'t go back and edit it. Anyway, that\\'s the most deep sleep I\\'ve ever gotten while tracking it on Fitbit. I think it probably means move more, sleep better. And I think if you\\'re moving more, then naturally you are not tied into electronics as much. I thought disconnecting from electronics was the key but not if you\\'re going to just go sit somewhere else, like read a book. You need to move more. That\\'s what I\\'m finding anyway. Would love to know if anyone else has discovered this with themselves.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n@AllThatGlitters, that makes sense to me. We know that excessive mental stimulation can make getting to sleep more difficult. And that deep sleep tends to occur early in the sleep cycle.\\xa0 As we all know, at the end of a day of vigorous activity, our bodies just fall into sleep. The mental component winds down, and our deep sleep is allowed to happen naturally. At least that\\'s how I see it.\\xa0Tried an experiment with a sustained nap yesterday afternoon. 4 hour nap, 1 hour deep sleep, very little REM activity. Felt very refreshed.\\n\\nWork out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California\\n\\n\\n\\nI have the Shawn Stevenson\\xa0book at home but not read it yet, never have time for reading despite my best intentions.\\xa0I use an app called Calm that has sleep stories to help my drift off to sleep each night, also take ZMA to help me sleep. The main trouble I have is sharing a bed with someone who needs medication that makes them twitch and snore all night... I keep having to get up in the night to take myself into the spare room to try and get some sleep. The interrupted nights are hurting me. I feel better after reading this thread though, at least I know I\\'m not alone in my less than an hour of deep sleep each night.\\n\\nAllie\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s fantastic!!!! Absolutely awesome that you got an hour of deep sleep when taking a 4 hour nap! I\\'m sure you did feel\\xa0refreshed!\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Alicat: \\xa0I wonder if getting one of those dual control mattresses would help? I forget what they\\'re called but you can adjust one side of the mattress without disturbing the other side.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nFWIW, I\\'ve read that antidepressants can stifle REM sleep (I took the stuff, not just Lexapro, but tried almost everything for 20 some years). But that\\'s different. The lack of deep sleep is happening to me, too. I\\'m 50 and I sleep for an average of seven hours- if I get *any* deep sleep, I\\'m lucky. Last night it was only 11 minutes! With everything I\\'m reading about how lack of deep sleep can lead to dementia and how our bodies can\\'t heal themselves properly without deep sleep, I\\'m letting the numbers kind of scare me . I thought it was hormones so I fixed that - I don\\'t have sleep apnea, I\\'m\\xa0 active and I live like a nun. I\\'m not really sure what\\'s going on, should we not really trust this figure? I do feel exhausted when I wake up. Really kind of a mystery. I\\'ll bet we\\'re not alone...\\n',\n",

       " '\\nMy fitbit seems to think I get little to no REM or Deep Sleep. Is this happening to anyone else? I have a sleep disorder, but it involves sleeping too much and doesn\\'t result in non REM or Deep Sleep. I just have trouble trusting my results and was wondering whether anyone else had the same feelings.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nModerator edit: subject for clarity \\n\\n\\nYes me! I\\'m often tired and have memory problems and that\\'s why I got a fitbit with a detailed sleep tracker. However I\\'m really alarmed at how little rem and deep sleep I seem to be getting! I\\'ve tried all the sleep hygiene tips I can find on the net, and been following Paul McKenna\\'s book but it\\'s still as bad. I\\'m hoping that the fitbit sleep tracker is inaccurate as I don\\'t know what else I can do. I really don\\'t think I suffer from sleep apnoea. I\\'d love to know others experiences.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHello!\\xa0So getting too little REM sleep can be an area for concern, but so can getting too much. Ideally, you guys have been in a sleep lab and know how much REM you guys are sleeping. Barring that (those things can get quite expensive), if you\\'re reaching about 20-25% REM sleep, that\\'s quite typical (give or take a few percentages to account for variance and the fact that we\\'re all unique).\\xa0When you guys say \"little\" or \"low\" REM sleep, how much are you guys talking about?\\xa0Sources:\\xa0https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleephttps://blog.fitbit.com/sleep-stages-explained/\\xa0The fitbit link is a more simplified version of understanding sleep stages, since Fitbit also simplifies the conception of sleep stages for our Charge 2.\\n\\n\\nHiya, thanks for responding.I sleep about 8 hours (I know, lucky me!) And last night for example I got 1 hour 38 mins rem (16%) and 29 mins deep.Previous night 1hr 15 rem (13%) and 59 mins deep.\\xa0It often doesn\\'t tell me percentages as so low.\\xa0Maybe I wear my tracker too loosley??Thanks!\\n\\n\\nHello again,\\xa016% REM is quite fuzzy, that 13% is markedly low indeed. If you say it often doesn\\'t say percentages are low, I\\'m assuming that getting less REM is recent? If so, how long ago was it saying you were getting more REM? Any changes in your sleep environment/household (like, are people coming in and out like a college dorm or shared apartment, are there moving vehicles/trains/trucks that travel late at night that wake you up sometimes, etc).\\xa0\\xa0Wearing the tracker too loosely can throw off your sleep stage readings; your device may actually revert to the old sleep stages screen if you get poor heart rate monitoring. The issue is, it\\'d be hard to tell where the line is drawn between \"inaccurate sleep stages\" and \"won\\'t measure them at all\" if you\\'re wearing it too loosely. Still, couldn\\'t hurt to tighten it a bit if you can comfortably.\\n\\n\\nHiya, I\\'ve only had the Alta hr for less than a week so don\\'t know if it\\'s a recent problem. I suspect it\\'s long-standing as I\\'m often tired no matter how much sleep I\\'ve had. That\\'s why I got the device with sleep stages.\\xa0I\\'ll try wearing the tracker a bit tighter and lower on my wrist and also hope it\\'s\\u200b just a temporary issue. I need to give it longer I guess.Thanks again.Ruth\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0Like negligible deep sleep. Which is funny because I think my sleep disorder typically results in much MORE deep sleep than necessary. This is just an example from last night\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThat looks similar to mine. I\\'ve been wearing mine quite loosely and further up my arm. Going to try more tightly and nearer the wrist. I think it\\'s probably not causing the problem though but just wanted to rule it out. I get really tired a lot of the time and think it\\'s maybe because I\\'m not getting enough deep and REM sleep. I don\\'t know what to do about it though!\\n\\n\\nHave you found any rhyme or reason to your sleep? Mine is similar to yours and it\\'s stressing me out a bit. I know in prior models you can change the sensitiviy mode but that doesn\\'t appear to be the case with the Charge 2. Last night I slept a total of 6hrs 20min and got a total of 24min deep sleep\\xa0I\\'m exhausted and I don\\'t know if I\\'m really tired or if it\\'s a mind thing \"knowing\" I only had 24min of deep sleep. This has been they type of sleep report I\\'ve been seeing since they rolled out the cycles. Is something wrong with mine? Is something wrong with me? I\\'m getting stressed over this. I wear it where I\\'m suppose to. Ugh, I guess really venting but hoping others have insight. Thank you! -Piglet612\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhat sensitivity setting do you have it on? Or rather, what hand is your dominant hand, what arm do you wear it to sleep, and does your Fitbit settings reflect those?\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThere isn\\'t a sensity setting, correct? I wear it on my non dominant hand(left) which is reflected in app. I have tried it on my other wrist tosleep and had same results. The firmware prior to the sleep cycles did notshow the crazy sleep that I\\'m getting with this new version.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nIf you wear it on your non-dominant hand and the app reflects this setting, it\\'s more sensitive and will pick up steps more easily to compensate for the idea that a non-dominant hand will not move as much as a dominant hand. If you switch it to your dominant hand, but leave the app setting for non-dominant hand, you may pick up even more movement. Wearing it on your dominant hand and switching the app setting to reflect this reduces sensitivity for steps (I\\'ve noticed that as I move while I sleep, I wake up with less \"added\" steps if I wear it on my dominant hand). Try giving that a shot, it could make your fitbit less likely to interpret movement during the night as always \"light\" sleep.\\n\\n\\nUnder personal information there is a sleep sensitivity setting: \\xa0 normal or sensitive\\n\\n\\nAccording to my tracker I do get enough deep sleep but get very very little REM sleep most of the nights. It\\'s around 5 % wich is about 30 - 50 minutes. I also hope my fitbit is wrong. If not, is this something to worry about? And what might cause this little REM sleep?\\n\\n\\nI have it on normal, was hoping it was sent on sensitive. I did set it to sensitive and then back to normal hoping that would trigger something. Also, slept with it on sensitive mode and it yielded similar results.\\n\\n\\nMy Fitbit shows I only get 2-4 hours a night sleep. I wonder if it\\'s because I\\'m always restless and turn a lot?\\n\\n\\n@Shirleyy\\xa02-4 hours of sleep out of how many hours of total sleep time.Im averaging 3:58 hours of sleep, but in the last 5 days i only averaged 5 total hors a night of sleep. 20% awake time is considered norma, when you add in the micro periods of awake time.\\n\\n\\nCharge 2,non dominant wrist, high sensitivity. REM averages 12minuets a night,some zero, some as “high” as 30 minutes. Sometimes reported asleep as little as \\xa03 hours, sometimes as much as 6, average Around 5.5. My doctor is under the impression Fitbit numbers are “remarkably unreliable” based on clients whose sleep they’ve studied with the fancy devices. I’ve decided to think of Fitbit as relatively internally accurate but nit realistically calibrated - so I read my numbers as a relative scale WRT sleep, dream, awake times. I wish I had accurate actual times tho...\\n\\n\\nI get about 6% REM at night and I’ve never had sleeping problems except sometimes getting up to pee. That’s about 20 minutes since I get an average of 8hrs 2mins a night. I figure it’s just wildly inaccurate since I don’t seem irritated when I wake up like it says I should. I get sleepy everyday about 3 pm but who doesn’t. Don’t fret the little toy on your wrist. If you’re actually worried a doctor is the person to discuss that with not a forum.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI see this thread started a while back, but wanted to share a similar experience.My deep sleep and light sleep times commonly fall within (and sometimes exceed) the benchmark averages. However, my REM percentages are so low, there is often no percentage reading and it falls well below the benchmarks on the bar graph.Initially I was concerned, then I thought my charge 2 might be\\xa0inaccurate. I decided not to worry about it too much; since that won\\'t help me sleep (!).I had extremely bad sleep for a number of years when I lost my wife to cancer. \\xa0For me, many of the tips for better sleeping help a lot... including guided meditations, occasional magnesium supplement (I use something called \"Calm\"), not exercising right before bed, eating better, etc. etc.I still hope that the Charge 2 is wrong and I\\'m getting more REM. Interested to see more responses in this thread.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nHi sleepy Community members!\\n\\xa0\\nDoes your sleep log look something like this?\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nIf you think your log is inaccurate when it shows this much restlessness, you\\'re not alone! A lot of Fitbit users have sleep logs like this, and many times it\\'s due to the fact that Sleep settings are on \"Sensitive\" mode instead of \"Normal\" mode. A little about these two modes:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.\\nThe sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep.\\n\\nWe strongly suggest that most users use the Normal setting. To change your settings to Normal, follow these steps, or visit our help article!\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTo change your setting\\xa0in the Fitbit iOS app, go to\\xa0Account\\xa0>\\xa0Advanced Settings\\xa0>\\xa0Sleep Sensitivity.\\n\\n\\nTo change your setting in the fitbit.com dashboard, go to\\xa0Settings\\xa0>\\xa0Devices\\xa0> scroll down to\\xa0Sleep Tracking.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nI hope this helps - let me know if you have any trouble changing this setting or if you have seen a difference in the accuracy of your sleep log after switching!\\n\\nCallie | Community Moderator, FitbitWant to join the Fitbit Community Council? Apply here.\\n\\n\\n\\nI found on normal my Charge HR overestimated my sleep, on sensitive it then recorded that my average nights\\' \"sleep\" was 2.5 - 3 hours in 15 - 20 sessions, no evidence of sleep cycles etc.\\xa0This helped me convince my GP that my memory problems, basically a random inability to access previous memories, especially how to find places and people I\\'d been to many times in the past, might be due to sleep.Had the overnight session with electrodes everywhere at Papworth, the UK\\'s sleep clinic, was found to be getting less than half the recommended amount of REM sleep which is when the brain does it\\'s \"memory filing\".Thought to be due to the brain not getting enough oxygen - trial with a CPAP machine reduced number of low oxygen periods from 16 an hour to a normal 4 an hour.\\xa0 Interestingly, not only did the Fitbit record my best ever \"non moving\" sleep (over 5 hours) but also that my heart rate stayed around 60 rather than as usual falling to the low 50\\'s and sometimes even below 50.\\n\\n\\n*yawn* Oh hey\\xa0@CallieM,\\xa0My sleep log (when I still used a Fitbit, and had it on Sensitive) looked a lot like that.\\xa017 times awake23 times awake3:01 really asleep\\xa0^^ A lot of my sleep logs on sensitive looked like THAT \\xa0-Kai\\n\\n\\nGood for you. I got on CPAP in the 90\\'s for the same reasons (plus I was going to sleep everytime I drove) Its well worth the aggrivation of getting used to using it. 🙂\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy sleep log looks that way in both normal and sensitive modes. \\xa0Sometimes it indicates that I do not get to sleep until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, which is grossly\\xa0inaccurate. I routinely go to bed and get to sleep around 10:30pm. However, I do have a problem with sleep-walking.\\n\\n\\nBut - but - but - How do you actually rule out a sleep disorder? I\\'ve got a sleep log that has always looked like that on the sensitive setting. It\\'s probably not a sleep disorder, but I\\'m wondering what happens when people go to a sleep doctor with a log like that. What are the types of movement in normal sleep that log as restless on the sensitive setting? How do you know if your log is \"accurate\" - if you knew whether it was accurate or not, you wouldn\\'t need the Fitbit to track your sleep. (In the meantime I\\'ll go back to the normal setting. )\\n\\n\\nIf you suspect you have a \"sleep disorder\" your doctor can refer you to do a sleep study. This requires at least one over night stay in which they hook you up to several electrodes and they determine if you are having apneas, (breathing lapses) and to what extent, if any. This is pretty conclusive and they will prescribe a cpap machine or some variant which will stop the apneas. They use the numbers gleened from the sleep study to input a certain pressure setting so that you are getting the right level of air to stop the apneas. Hope this helps and hope you are well. 🙂\\n\\n\\nmy fitbit is set to normal but it still has all the restless lines, does anyone know why?\\n\\n\\nThere are chunks of hours missing from my sleep log sometimes each night, so it looks like I only slept 2 hours instead of 8. I have switched from normal to sensitive and back, made sure my fitbit was fully charged each night, tried switching wrists. It seems accurate the times I do wake up to go to the ladies room, and the time I wake up, but the time I went to bed/sleep vs it says when I actually was asleep, can also be hours off.\\xa0 I think the sleep is monitored by heart rate correct? If its at a low hr\\xa0its considered sleep? Its not like I am sleep walking, or it would say I am awake right? Or would track additional steps? I believe the \"restlessness\" times, (too many animals in my bed and can tell by how trashed my bed is in the morning) but I dont understand the missing chunks of time.\\xa0 Am I transporting myself into another dimension?\\xa0 lol\\xa0 Or does my fit bit have a glitch/issue?

Switching to normal gives me results that correspond more with how I experience the night, but then - why use fitbit at all? At this point it\\'s just a handy log of when I went to bed and got up. But you may have a clue in mentioning animals on the bed. I don\\'t have animals and switching to normal worked; while you have animals and switching to normal doesn\\'t work. Still leaves the question of what it\\'s measuring. Animals shifting? Someone snoring? Someone breathing? Telepathic reception of all dreams going on in the bed?In the meantime, grinding my manual coffee grinder (circular motion with arm) gives me steps so maybe that\\'s what FB is: something that saves us from carrying pencil and paper around.In normal, pre-FB life, I can tell if I\\'m getting adequate sleep (what sleep deficit has accumulated) by how long weekend naps are and how necessary a nap feels when I\\'m home and it\\'s a real possibility.\\n\\n\\nHello,I have a problem with Sleep monitoring - my Fitbit assumes that I am asleep, when I am awake.I have the fitbit charge HR on my dnon-dominant hand, and I have the sleep setting on Normal and wrist placement on dominant.\\xa0I usually lie in bed for about half an hour in the morning, listening to the radio and using my phone, however this is still seen as sleep -sometimes I can even go to the loo and still be classed as asleep.I tried using sensitive and had incredibly innacurate sleep reading and if I set the wrist placement to non-dominant, Fitbit overestimates my steps by about 20%.It would be nice to modestly increase the sensitivity of the device during sleep, but not wakefulness, so it becomes more accurate.\\n\\n\\n@Rowmoseley\\xa0thanks for chiming in with your experience. I\\'m glad your tracker was able to mimic what the CPAP machine was helping with.\\xa0@Synapz\\xa0are you still having an issue with this?\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@SunsetRunner\\xa0Fitbit provides services to help you live a healthier life, but please keep in mind that our trackers and services\\xa0are not intended to provide medical data. Please see your doctor if you\\'re concerned with being diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Also, as the original post mentions, the \"normal\" setting is going to be the most accurate setting for almost everyone, and we strongly suggest most everyone use the normal setting.\\n\\xa0\\n@sharimah\\xa0it\\'s normal to still have restless lines in your sleep log, even if it\\'s set to \"normal.\" I\\'d be a little concerned if there weren\\'t any (or a little jealous, because it means you sleep like a log and don\\'t move at all during the night!)\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@NugsMom\\xa0hmm, that sounds odd. Sleep is monitored by movement, so if you have a lot of animals in your bed, and you\\'re moving a lot during the night, your tracker might actually think you\\'re awake. That being said, can you please\\xa0try a restart of your tracker? Let me know if this helps at all.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n@djbarker\\xa0thanks for your question. Since your tracker determines \"sleep\" by how much movement you make during the night, if you\\'re laying in bed in the morning being relatively still, your tracker may still \\'think\\' you are asleep. If you\\'re concerned about your awake time being inaccurate, you can go into your sleep log and edit your awake time.

Are there physical factors that correlate roughly to actual sleep but that aren’t actual artifacts of sleep?(Kind of like the way grinding coffee on my manual coffee grinder with my Fitbit arm adds up steps.)

       " '\\nAnyone else using the new pulse ox feature and being told that you die at night? lol! My nightly range is from 89-93%... which seems like I\\'m oxygen deprived at night. Of course I know that it can\\'t be medically accurate since it\\'s on our wrist and we move around a lot, but just wondering if anyone else is getting really low ranges. And are we all at 93% right now? I compared to 6 friends, everyone\\'s said 93%.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI disagree that it can\\'t be medically accurate, and you are still alive.\\xa0 Perhaps you are comparing to waking SpO2 levels, but sleeping SpO2 levels are lower.\\xa0 According to one medical source I just looked up:\"Oxygen levels are considered abnormal when they fall below 88%.\"I am not saying that it is accurate, but just that 89-93 could be reasonable.\\n\\nBefore posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.\\n\\n\\n\\nI am also interested in the Versa 2 accuracy for SpO2.\\xa0 My nightly values have varied much more than I would expect.\\xa0 Two nights ago the range was 92%-95% and last night it was 97%-100%.\\xa0 Over 12 nights of data, the minimum values are between 88% and 97%;\\xa0 the averages are between 93% and 98%; the maximum values are between 95% and 100%.\\xa0 My daytime SpO2 values with a finger pulse oximeter are consistently 96%-98%.\\n\\n\\nI have been between 92 and 94 for the past 2 weeks. Now it doesn\\'t monitor at all. totally stopped working. went on site for help and they tell me that my watch doesn\\'t match my name. i explained to the I have upgraded my watch 2 times since being on site, but they have me check somewhere else and when I come back they are gone. What a great support group from FitBit.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy pulse and Spo2 are 2 numbers less than my pulse oximeter. 68bpm would be 70 and my Spo2 would be 95 instead of 98.some times my pulse will match Spo2 not so much.\\n\\n\\n@AragonAl\\xa0it is hard to talk about accuracy when you have no access to data on demand. You can\\'t cross-examine results with any other device and neither you can do the on-the-spot test. In such a case, I wouldn\\'t stress too much with the results if even Fitbit isn\\'t confident enough to release the SpO2 feature such as it could be tested for accuracy and verified against other devices.\\n\\n\\nIf you have sleep apnea like I me you stop breathing for a few seconds each night . This may effect the Spo2 reading.I can\\'t say for sure since the watch can\\'t give me a reading during the day.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nPulse oximetry is a standard monitoring device in intensive care units ICUs, currently used to guide therapeutic interventions. Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of SPO\\xa0in critically ill patients. Our objective was to compare pulse oximetry with arterial oxygen saturation SAO2\\xa0in such patients, and to examine the effect of several factors on this relationship.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI have been monitoring the Fitbit (night) vs Oximeter during the day.\\xa0 Big disconnect, although night time is supposed to be lower than daytime.\\xa0 I think the delta is too high at 2-3%.\\xa0 Anyway there is a BIG spread in daily Fitbit O2 levels whereas the oximeter is much more steady and stable.\\xa0 I personally think that the Fitbit is not all that accurate as I have had medical grade oximeter readings a few time this month and they are a much better match to the oximeter than the Fitbit.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMy FitBit gives me lower readings than my oxymeter. I think it\\'s probable that your Fitbit along with your 6 friends are getting readings below what is accurate.\\xa0 Mmy fitbit says at night my oxygen is 95-97%.\\xa0 That is lower than normal for me but I am currently not near my oxymeter so I have to wait to get home to compare the accuracy.\\n\\n\\nSame I’m between 90-94 I need to stop looking at it I am getting anxiety 😟. \\xa0\\n\\n\\nYour oxygen levels do decrease while your sleeping since your breathing is steady and slower. Your oxygen level will very based on the type of sleep you have as well; light sleep, deep sleep, or REM sleep. 90% or higher is normal oxygenation when sleeping.\\xa0 Then factor in mouth breathing, illness, stuffy nose, etc. can change your O2 levels as well.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI just downloaded the spo2 clock for my versa 2 a couple hours ago and it’s reading \\xa078-81 but I’m breathing fine so I’m questioning the accuracy of this\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHis is the problem I’m having. My oxygen read as 78 last night. But I feel fine, lol. Did you ever get it figured out?\\n\\n\\nNever solved.\\xa0 Delta continues to be about 2% from daytime vs.sleep.\\xa0 That said, it is within the measuring error of the devices of +/- 2%.\\xa0 See the latest Oximeter vs. Fitbit plot below.\\xa0 \\xa0this is just short of 9 months of data.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThanks for posting. Yeah, same here. It’s not accurate. While lower amounts may be “normal,“ it’s not healthy to have levels that low while sleeping. The heart rate is never 100% accurate either. It’s usually off by about 5 to 10% in my experience. I don’t mind that as much because in many cases one doesn’t really need an exact heart rate assessment.

You should not use or rely on Fitbit SpO2 for any medical purposes.\"\\xa0 However my take on it is this: I\\'d rather have this estimate available to me than not... so thank you Fitbit for including it in the feature set for this watch.\\xa0 So to answer your question above... so far I get an average anywhere from 93% up to 96% with my lowest in range ever being down to 90%-93%.\\xa0 Remember with a recognized 4% variation for the pulse oximeter technology, my 93% average could theoretically have been as low as 89% true oxygen saturation (time to consult a medical professional) and my lowest in range could have dropped to as low as 86%, gasp!\\xa0 I\\'m not worried however as I don\\'t wake up continuously all night long and I feel well rested in the mornings.\\n\\n\\nI was getting low readings, averaging 85-88 per night.\\xa0 I was getting anxious and spoke to my doctor about this but he was not overly concerned since it was a wrist reading and many things can interfere with an accurate reading.\\xa0 His advice (which seems to have worked) helped and my readings are 93-96 overnight.His advice was since we tend to wear our watch nonstop with showers, exercise, cooking, cleaning, etc it is important to ensure any particles on the wrist and watch are cleaned and not interfering with the sensor:Ensure the sensor does not have any dirt, dust, or other particle on it.\\xa0 Just before bed wash your wrist and wipe the sensor area of the watch.\\xa0 Lotions, dust, and other particles transferred from our skin or from normal wear can create an interference of the sensor light.\\xa0 Even natural oils from our skin need to be wiped off the back of the watch or if we shower with it, water that dries on the sensor can leave a \"haze\" (think dried water on a window type spot).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0I started to clean my wrist where the sensor meets the skin with an astrigent cleaner or alcohol right before bed and will wipe down the back of my watch with a clean cloth (almost like polishing) and it really has helped to get a more accurate reading.\\xa0 It has only been +/- 1 or 2 numbers off now instead of 10.\\n',\n",

Beware of this so call sleep medication because it isn\\'t to be used as a sedative. Magnesium is better for sleep as not only does it help you calm the mind it also helps your heart & the rest of your body functions.Most of us now lack magnesium.\\n\\n\\n@Xenus\\xa0It\\'s nice to see you around!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWow, 😮 this is very great information and thanks for taking the time to share this with us!\\xa0🙂\\n\\xa0\\nSee you around.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\\n\\n\\n\\nGlad to see this topic.\\xa0 \\xa0I just wanted to fall asleep a bit faster.\\xa0 I bought Melatonin 3 mg.\\xa0 \\xa0So, I took a 3 mg and cut it in half, so I figured it was about 1.5mg.\\xa0 I felt less was more for me.

Melatonin is naturally produce in the darkness of night whether you sleep or are awake. Sleep is natural and important to your well-being and for those that don\\'t sleep well it\\'s best to try and find the source of why not. You cannot force yourself to sleep and you need to find what time is your natural time to sleep and wakeup refreshed plus able to function well the next day. Melatonin can be taken in the morning to help (but there\\'s little evidence that it works) or 7-8 hours before bed to help change your bedtime to earlier.Melatonin is used for those with sleep disorders of the circadian clock cycle where someone\\'s sleep is out of sync with the rest of the society yet the use of melatonin for this purpose doesn\\'t have any proof of correcting the sleep wake times. I would say that melatonin serves little use in helping a person to fall asleep. Melatonin can cause nightmares,reduced body temperature,changes to heart rate,sweating,feeling cold and shouldn\\'t be taken by those that are diabetic.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nHello\\xa0@GretaS,\\xa0@cathm,\\xa0@Xenus.

So you would just take the deep or rem time in minutes divided by the total time asleep and the percentage is higher then FITBIT says because they include awake time and micro awake times.Also since FITBIT includes awake times of 30 seconds or so I just change my time asleep goal to 6 hours and 45 minutes which would be more then the minimal 7 hours recommendation if you have only 30 min of fit bit awake time.\\n',\n",

Welcome to the community forums!\\n\\xa0\\nThank you for being part of the Fitbit family and for sharing your experience. I\\'d like to let you know that\\xa0Resting\\xa0heart\\xa0rate\\xa0is the number of times your\\xa0heart\\xa0beats per minute when you’re still and well-rested. Typically,\\xa0resting\\xa0heart\\xa0rate\\xa0ranges from 60-100 bpm, but the\\xa0rate\\xa0can vary based on age and fitness level.\\n\\xa0\\nLifestyle changes can boost heart health and lower your pulse. Here are some good tips:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1. Manage stress: anxiety and stress can elevate the heart rate, too. To help bring it down, try to bring calm to your day, For this, you can practice mindfulness, try to meditate or do breathing exercises.\\n\\xa0\\n2. Avoid caffeine and nicotine:\\xa0caffeine and cigarettes can drive your heart rate up, cutting back (or cutting them out entirely) may help lower your resting heart rate.\\n\\xa0\\n3. Get moving:\\xa0The most common cause of a high resting heart rate is a sedentary lifestyle, one where you spend a lot of time not moving.\\xa0And being in poor shape can increase the risk of other problems, including obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4.\\xa0Stay hydrated: dehydration can cause the blood to thicken. That means your poor heart has to work even harder to push the blood around. To give your heart a break and lower resting heart rate, drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol (which can dehydrate you).\\n\\xa0\\nNote that Heart rate varies from person to person and day-to-day. But if you notice your heart rate is consistently over 100, especially if you’ve tried making lifestyle changes, it’s worth mentioning it to your doctor.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHope this helps.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\\n\\n\\n\\n… last reply got cut off mid way!i am trying to get any doctor to take me seriously on this: no one seems to think it’s an issue, but it is an issue. Poor sleep links to so many other chronic health issues.\\xa0I’m planning on going back to the GP and trying to insist they refer me to a sleep clinic.if at least one of us can get answers it may solve the mystery for all.ps… the only possible theory I found is that it’s caused my longstanding anxiety.I had\\xa0burn out 15 years ago and I’m wondering if it reprogrammed my anxiety response and I’m now in some kind of permanent state physically.i don’t feel overly stressed - at least not every single day … but maybe I’m just used to it now.have you suffered from anxiety?\\n\\n\\nI am 130 lbs and exercise 4-5 times a week. It is NOT being sedentary that’s causing this.\\xa0given the amount of health data you guys collect it’s about time you returned the favour and gave us some answers about this!My multiple fitbits have shown this happens to me EVERY night and has done for years. No doctor seems to think it’s an issue, but rubbish sleep that’s ineffective IS obviously an issue…can you shed any further light on this?\\n\\n\\nI have the exact same thing happening to me. Almost every night my heart stays above my resting heart rate. I’ve tried taking nine of my beds before bed, no alcohol… all I can think of is my anxiety, too. Which is pretty bad. My fight or flight kicks in pretty quick but why is it staying like this ALL night, right??\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t…. It’s concerning isn’t it? I do worry about it.I’ve been taking Ashwsghadna since January and think it’s helped overall with level of anxiety but not the heart rate thing.I’ve had my gene profile done and know I have gene mutations that mean my body is very slow at breaking down stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine. This means they stay in my system longer and I can’t ‘come down’ as quickly. Even cycling home post 8pm is enough to keep me awake because the adrenaline doesn’t go for hours!Maybe you’ve got the same.I’m not sure there’s a solution other than trying to live like a Buddhist monk and not ever get stressed past lunchtime!Sent from my iPhone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExactly!

That is considered a measure of sympathetic activation (fight or flight response), so if it’s stress, it might show up there too. There are published HRV norms by age and sex — see where you stand. Practicing resonant breathing a.k.a. coherence can improve HRV (reduce physiological effects of stress).\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but that was a copy-and-paste response about HR lowering techniques generally, and it didn\\'t speak at all to the fact that some of us have a sleeping HR that largely stays above our RHR (only 7% last night, for example).\\xa0 I\\'ve noticed this trend increasing in my case and it\\'s impacting my sleep quality score thanks to being 10 or more points below optimal on the \"Restoration\" component (e.g., last night\\'s score being 14/25 while Time Asleep was 42/50 and Deep and REM was 22/25.\\xa0 I more focused response--if one is available--would be appreciated.\\xa0\\n',\n",

So the brain sends a signal for the person to be \\xa0aroused from phase 3 sleep, for example, back up to phase 1 sleep, and the person is not aware of this during the night. A sleep study in a sleep lab would tell you whether you are being roused from sleep during the night.

       " '\\nIt would be useful to be able to log how you feel each morning (e.g. refreshed, tired, groggy or wired, or maybe just a simple scale 1-5 ) in the Sleep Log so you can see how the aspects of the sleep data (restoration, time, awake periods etc) affect how you *actually* feel. I have often been told I had a \"good\" sleep score, but in fact I feel dreadful like I had a terrible night\\'s sleep. Having a log of how you feel along side the data can help you identify, for example, how much sleep you personally need and, if sleep appears to be \"good\", you could then look at what other factors might be either causing fatigue or having a positive effect. Without being able to log how you feel compared with the data, you can\\'t see any patterns. I also think this data would massively contribute to AI learning about the relationship between sleep and tiredness across the population.\\xa0In addition to logging how you feel there could potentially be other things to record like whether you used your phone before bed or had a bath or used a sleep pillow mist.... Logging pre-bed activity could help people hone their bed time routine for the best nights sleep.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nFor some time now I have been annoyed by finding incomplete or missing sleep data when I wake up in the morning. I finally found a solution to this, at least with the Charge 4. If your sleep data are incomplete in your app (e.g. it suddenly stops displaying data half-way through the night), you can click on the day in question under Sleep, touch the little drop-down menu in the upper right corner, and choose Edit Log. Then manually enter your actual wakeup time and Save.I did this and suddenly the missing data appeared. The device had recorded it but, for some reason, wouldn't display it in the app. You can use the same trick if the app shows no data at all. Just create a new log with the time you fell asleep (if not sure, estimate it) and the time you woke up. The Fitbit app will then show whatever data is has for that time period.I have done this with missing sleep data going back to last November and have managed to recover data for every night I thought I had missed. You can also do this on the web site, and more easily than you can with the app.Hope this helps someone. It solved a major annoyance for me.\\n\",\n",

For night when the app displays no data at all, I have found the creating a new long with my approximate sleep and wake time will cause the app to display all the data it has for that period.The Fitbit device apparently collects sleep data reliably, but does not reliably display it in the app. Clearly, there a bug in the software somewhere.I\\'m using a Charge 4, FYI.\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s another example from today:What I\\'m asking for is the ability to select and delete that fifteen minutes of REM sleep that didn\\'t actually happen (because I was awake that whole time), so that one continuous period of sleeplessness is what the data shows.\\xa0Alternatively, it might be a good idea to add some specific parameters to the sleep sensitivity settings, instead of just being sensitive or normal.\\xa0 I\\'d like to be able to increase the amount of time one must lie still before the device considers one to be asleep.\\xa0And, once again, I\\'m requesting that the mods move this thread to the\\xa0the \"Feature Suggestions\" subforum.\\xa0 I\\'m not interested in tricks that might fool the existing system into providing slightly better data (I\\'ve tried them, and the quality of this data is still poor); I\\'d like to help improve it for everyone.\\n',\n",

However if I edit my sleep log to say I went to sleep at 12:00, you would expect it to say I slept 8 hours and was only awake 30 minutes, but it actually says I was now awake for 58 minutes and only slept for 7 hrs 32 minutes, so reducing my actual sleep time by 30 minutes while keeping time awake basically the same.

You have to ask yourself how important your sleep and it\\'s related health aspects are to you.\\n\\nWork out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m wondering this as well. I realize I\\'m a few years after the post, but new to fitbit. I think the 1 hour awake that Fitbit registers wasn\\'t taken into consideration when people recommend 8 hours of sleep, so I tend to agree with your choice of B.\\xa0And, to be honest, I\\'m not sure we really are awake for that hour. The algorithm that fitbit uses to determine where you are asleep or not is based on movement. So, I think you would not be able to move the whole night for the whole night to be registered as sleep on a fitbit, and I\\'m not sure that just because you move you are awake!\\xa0Yes, I\\'m in same boat. To get 8 hours I need to be in bed by 8:30 on worknights. That\\'s hard to do with kids, chores, any time to relax after work.\\xa0\\n',\n",

It may be worth noting that I am unwell with the flu currently.\\xa0I have tremendous health anxiety and this isn’t helping my cause! Thanks for any advice\\xa0\\n\\n\\nI used to have this. I had more frequent high peaks than you did. I went to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. I wear a CPAP every night and no longer have this issue as long as I wear my CPAP.My doctor referred me to the sleep clinic because I had issues with migraines when I woke up in the morning.\\xa0\\n',\n",

Specifically, HRV during sleep. I've found multiple sleep-stage and HR validation papers, but none on HRV for any Fitbit band. Has this been validated?\\n\",\n",

       " '\\nThe recommendation for time asleep and percentage they are saying like if you fell asleep at 10 and woke at 6 and don’t have any memory of being awake for a prolonged period of time that is an 8 hour sleep. They aren’t deducting micro awake times or 1 to 2 minutes a few times a night.Also if you take the total time slept and recalculate the percentage without the awake percentage: when they refer to needing 13 to 20 percent of deep sleep that’s of your total time asleep. So you would just take the deep or rem time in minutes divided by the total time asleep and the percentage is higher then FITBIT says because they include awake time and micro awake times.Also since FITBIT includes awake times of 30 seconds or so I just change my time asleep goal to 6 hours and 45 minutes which would be more then the minimal 7 hours recommendation if you have only 30 min of fit bit awake time.\\n',\n",
