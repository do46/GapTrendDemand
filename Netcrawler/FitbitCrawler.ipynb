The names of the stages are what we’ve chosen to use in your Fitbit sleep log.\\xa0LIGHT SLEEPLight sleep serves as the entry point into sleep each night as your body unwinds and slows down. This stage typically begins within minutes of falling asleep. During the early part of light sleep, you may drift between being awake and asleep. You may be somewhat alert and can be easily awoken. Breathing and heart rate typically decrease slightly during this stage. \\xa0Light sleep promotes mental and physical recovery.DEEP SLEEPDeep sleep typically occurs in the first few hours of sleep. When you wake up feeling refreshed in the morning, you’re likely to have experienced solid periods of deep sleep during the previous night. During deep sleep, it becomes harder to be awakened since your body becomes less responsive to outside stimuli. Breathing becomes slower and muscles relax while heart rate usually becomes more regular. Adults may see a normal decrease in deep sleep as we get older, though sleep patterns vary among people.\\xa0Deep sleep promotes physical recovery and aspects of memory and learning. This stage has also been shown to support your immune system.\\xa0REM SLEEPThe first phase of REM sleep typically occurs after you’ve had an initial stage of deep sleep. You generally stay in REM sleep for a longer period of time during sleep cycles occurring in the second half of the night. During this final stage of sleep, your brain becomes more active. Dreams mainly occur during REM sleep, and your eyes move quickly in different directions. Heart rate increases and breathing becomes more irregular. In principle, muscles below the neck are inactive to avoid acting out dreams.REM sleep has been shown to play an important role in mood regulation, learning, and memory as your brain processes and consolidates information from the previous day so that it can be stored in your long-term memory.',\n",

A lot of you suspect that you may have a sleeping disorder such as Narcolepsy or Hypersomnia. From what I\\'ve read, experts believe that there are many people suffering with undiagnosed sleeping disorders, so don\\'t be afraid to bring this up to your physician, and advocate for yourself. My primary care physician initially just thought I was tired because I had four small children. Fortunately (well, in terms of getting a diagnosis is was fortunate), I was suffering from some other symptoms that pointed to more of a sleeping disorder as opposed to just the daytime sleepiness, so he referred me to a Pulmonologist who speacialized in Sleep Medicine. I did an overnight sleep study and a sleep latency nap study the following day. The criterion for a diagnosis of Narcolepsy (at least it was in 2006) is a sleep latency (time it takes to fall asleep) of less than five minutes for five naps (20 minutes max length) that are spaced two hours apart, and you must enter REM sleep in at least two of the five naps.\\xa0\\xa0Here is a sampling of my sleep patterns according to my FitBit. I\\'ve definitely seen a lot worse on here. LOL That\\'s why I\\'m posting this so that some of you might feel confident enough to tell your docs that you think there might be something more than just your average sleepiness. Now, I will say that part of the problem for Narcoleptics is not spending enough time in the most restorative stages of the sleep. Fitbit only records \"restless\" and \"deep sleep\" and of course it\\'s not based on brain waves, so there\\'s no way to know when you\\'ve been in REM sleep, etc. However, it gives you a pretty good idea of the amount of sleep you\\'re getting.\\xa0I tried to include a wide sampling, showing some of my best and worst nights.

At least my Fitbit seems to think so. Less restlessness.\\xa0Try vitamin D supplements. Increase the dose gradually every day, and monitor your Fitbit\\'s sleep analysis. See if your restlessness goes down and see if you start feeling better. When you reach the level of sleep regularity that you\\'re comfortable with, start tapering off the vitamin D. See how much you can reduce the dose before your sleep begins to become restless again.\\xa0Hope this helped. Good luck with it.

And very good of you to speak up about it.I have anxiety and at one point I got anxiety mostly before bed and panic attacks about the fact that I could/would not sleep, which made it so much worse. Starting your night with a good hour of crying does not help.\\xa0I am trying to remember what helped for me:1. Discovering that I am not my fear, but that I have a fear. Realising that I have thoughts and that I am not my thougts. So when I was thinking something that was created by the fear, I would try my best to change my thoughts to what I wanted to think. For me the fear actually sometimes felt like it was outside myself, like a voice or a monster in my head. So at times I would talk to it and tell it how wrong it was (or my boyfriend would ask me to say what the voice was saying and he would speak back, learned so many good come back lines for it from him).2. Doing 5 minutes of yoga before bed to calm the body down. You might not be in as much control over the mind as over you body, but they co-exist. And it is easier for the mind to be calm in a calm body. As well as phobias and anxiety having the tendency to create tension in your shoulders, neck and jaw, so it is good to try and release that.3. Do a breathing exercise before going to sleep.\\xa0Now when I wake up in the middle of the night due to my anxiety I can calm myself back down by doing a combination of breathing exercise and child's pose.\\xa0I am not saying you should not see a doctor. I don't know how much sleep you are getting at the moment and for the short term a sleep pill could help you out. I can only share my own experience. However, for the long term you will have to find a way to get this phobia under control. The doctor can also get you an appointment with a psychologist if you feel you could use help with this from one.\\xa0One thing that I learned myself:Try not to go overboard with all the sleeping aids like tea, oils etc. etc. While they can help you fall asleep as they calm the body and nervous system, the problem for us is in our minds and I found that the more I relied on those kind of aids the stronger my mind became about not going to sleep.\\n\\nKarolien | The Netherlands\",\n",

Best I can tell (before fitbit) I probably got about 4-5 hours of sleep half the time, 6 hours on a good night.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Getting up early to exercise has enabled me to stay in bed and remain screen-free overnight; I get back to sleep easier when I wake up in the middle of the night. After I committed to this routine I got my Fitbit and now I know I more routinely get 6 hours of sleep with about an hour of wake time scattered over the course of the night (which Fitbit says is normal for men my age). Clearly an improvement.\\xa0\\xa0So I\\'m looking to improve to an average of about 6.5 hours of sleep per night, and then increase from there. But in order to exercise I have to get up at 5AM. Now that my wife has early work hours, she needs to get up at 4:50 AM, so I get up with her (we exercise together).\\xa0On a normal night, I help my daughter to bed and she\\'s asleep by about 9:30. If housework is done at that time I can get to bed and be asleep by, say 9:45.\\xa0\\xa0Obviously, I\\'d love to have less awake time in the middle of the night, as that would get me some bonus sleep given my time constraints, but I don\\'t have much control over that.\\xa0\\xa0Working out after work is not really an option because I get out of the office at 5:30 and home by 6:20, meaning it\\'s time to cook dinner. By the time we\\'ve eaten, cleaned up from dinner and given our food time to digest, it\\'s close to bedtime.\\xa0\\xa0On paper, you\\'d think I\\'d get more sleep if I gave up exercising in the morning and pushed the alarm clock back to 6AM to get ready for work, but the exercise is what\\'s preventing full-blown insomnia.

After cutting down on your sleep, you’ll naturally become sleepier at night, leading you to sleep more deeply.\\xa0\\nNext, if you find yourself awake at night for more than fifteen minutes, get out of bed. Go to a quiet, dimly lit couch or comfortable chair, and do a relaxing activity like reading, meditating, or gentle stretching. Once you feel drowsy again, head back to bed.\\xa0\\nFinally, stick to your normal wake up time, even if you had a bad night of sleep the night before. Staying consistent with a bedtime and wake up time will help your body remain in tune with its circadian rhythm, and help your chances of resting peacefully through the night. *(best comments I've read)\\n\\nWant to get more active? ᕙ(˘◡˘)ᕗ Visit Get Moving in the Health & Wellness Forums.

When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep. While you’re sleeping, your device tracks the beat-to-beat changes in your heart rate, known as heart rate variability (HRV), which fluctuate as you transition between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages. When you sync your device in the morning, we use your movement and heart rate patterns to estimate your sleep cycles from the previous night.\"\\xa0Taken from:\\xa0https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htm',\n",

The sleep study was covered by my insurance. During the 8 hour study, they found that I never went into a deep sleep and moved over 800 times during the night. They kept me the next day for further study. They had me lay down for a nap every hour and a half to see if I could fall asleep and how quickly. I fell asleep every time. They ended up diagnosing it as \"hypersomnolence\" which to me is the same as CFS.I took sleeping pills for many years but the last year I have weaned myself off and now only take melatonin. I think I slept better on the sleeping pills but I hate to be dependant on them. When I do feel decent when I wake up, its usually the nights that I dont play on my phone before bed.

Any health care provider who does not listen to and learn from their patients is to be avoided! The total hours slept reported by the fitbit are valuable data for a health care provider, especially as it is accepted lore in the medical community that people with insomnia most often greatly under-estimate the amount of sleep they get, making self-report unreliable (I don\\'t agree with this). Physicians are trained early to report subjective \"symptoms\" (reported by the patient) and separately objective \"signs\" (where there is external evidence).\\xa0Looking at my own data, I find the total hours slept to be the most helpful sleep data. I tend to push myself too hard and pay for it. The fitbit gives me hard data about self-care that is essential to my work and health. Sleep disturbance is very important, as it is correlated with suicide; mood; thought content; cognitive funcitoning; psychomotor function and safety; and heart health, just to name a few functions. I have no idea what the restlessness indicators actually signify, but it is interesting to look at that data as well. If a patient brought me a fitbit report that indicated a consistent lack of sleep, I would place it in the chart, especially if it were from a Charge or above (which track sleep automatically and are thus more reliable). We have discussed purchasing several trackers to send home on our patients to monitor their activity level (our mandate is health maintenance and prevention). These things are more than toys. They can be useful motivational tools, and they provide relevant and reliable data that is helpful to track a variety of modifiable lifestyle factors--which are increasingly recognized as the vanguard of medicine. I have no doubt we are seeing just the beginning of their use. I use biofeedback for some folks, and adding a heart rate variability function to the fitbit may be one of the next features we see. HRV is useful for addressing anxiety, the most common mental health problem. Galvanic skin response might be another option as this is correlated with anxiety as well. An enterprising student invented a sensor to place in shoes, which is able to detect changes of gait that signify an increased risk of falling in the elderly (falls are a main precipitant to death in the elderly). There is no end of possibilities to do useful and clever new things with this technology.

       " 'As someone who has been interested in deep sleep, I was pleased when Fitbit rolled out the sleep stages. Over the last few weeks, my deep sleep has plummeted, and I\\'ve tried a few things to improve it. One in particular has worked really well, that I\\'d like to share.\\n\\xa0\\nBut first, what is deep sleep, and why is it important, especially to people engaging in fitness. Deep sleep is the most mysterious part of sleep, because we\\'re not awake, we\\'re not consciously dreaming. Really, there\\'s not much going on at all, mentally. And that\\'s important, to give us a break from thinking so we can process and integrate our experiences.In terms of physical health, deep sleep is critical. Potent hormones such a GH and IGF-1 are released during deep sleep. These hormones are linked to physical health as well as performance. When I don\\'t get enough deep sleep, my strength workouts really suffer. Interestingly enough, getting a small amount of overall sleep affects me less than getting 8 hours of sleep, but very little deep sleep. That\\'s how important it is.\\nI read a lot of articles and papers online about getting more deep sleep. But almost all of them were just generic advice on getting more and better sleep. They didn\\'t focus on deep sleep itself, which is what I\\'m trying to improve. So I began experimenting...\\n\\xa0\\nSince deep sleep is a kind of oblivion (from the mind\\'s perspective), there\\'s no real conscious way to make it happen. While there are many tricks to falling asleep, or inducing dreams, the realm of deep sleep seems less traveled.So what\\'s worked for me? First, is acknowledging I can\\'t consciously put myself into deep sleep, because the very nature of deep sleep is unconscious. This may seem obvious, but it was an important realization to me. Because deep sleep occurs near the beginning of the sleep cycle, before REM, I feel the \"getting to sleep\" portion of the night is the most important aspect of getting deep sleep.Recently, when I can\\'t sleep, I\\'ve taken to just getting out of bed, have some water, read a little. Just forget all about getting to sleep. Last night I went to sleep when ready, instead of when I should. I got less than 6 hours sleep, but my deep sleep was greatly increased. Today\\'s workout I hit two personal records (squat and overhead press), and felt fine afterwards, despite not much sleep. It will be interesting to see the relationship between amount of overall sleep compared to deep sleep. For now, my experience says the amount of deep sleep is critical to physical performance.Would love to hear other\\'s thoughts on the subject.Edit 2/24/2018:\\n\\nCompilation of tips and links from the first 8 Pages:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSource: https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gartenberg_the_brain_benefits_of_deep_sleep_and_how_to_get_more_of_it?...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a great guy Shawn Stevenson.

I think there are a few that may be questionable as to their effectiveness. But what hasn\\'t been mentioned much in this thread is the role of diet and gut health may play in promoting enough deep sleep. That being said, I feel as though the line can be blurred here between what\\'s specifically helpful for\\xa0deep\\xa0sleep vs sleep in general (light and REM stages).\\xa0\\nhttps://www.alexfergus.com/blog/how-to-increase-deep-sleep\\nhttps://selfhacked.com/blog/methods-to-fall-asleep-insomniac/\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nStress\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGratitude list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWrite down worries\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think in various ways we’re all saying the same thing - mental stress. Getting 10k steps isn’t just about getting the steps, it’s about carving out that time for yourself. So is disconnecting from electronics. When I take care of my mental self, I get deep sleep. I barely got any exercise over Christmas, but my sleep was excellent because my anxiety was low. That’s going to be different for each of us, but I think the core of it is the same - making time toward the end of each day to spend time doing the thing that makes us happy. For me, it’s keeping my caffeine consumption low during the day and then reading a book before I fall asleep. For someone else, it’s digging in the dirt. But what I heard on this forum is a lot of anxiety and not a lot of time carved out of the day to take care of our inner selves. That’s the greatest treat we can give ourselves these days - the gift of time for ourselves. Maybe that sounds hokey, but that has been the biggest thing for me, more than what I eat or drink or if I use F.lux on my devices (I do). I know that’s easier said than done, but I hope my experience helps someone get better sleep tonight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCalm app and meditation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTimings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve read and heard from more than a few sources that getting to bed before 10pm is recommended\\n\\xa0\\nThey say if you go to bed at 10am, you get the optimum sleep and recovery etc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving a set routine is really critical for the body to know when to shut down and repair\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nTools\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLinking up the sleep stage monitoring so that the deep sleep enhancing sounds are played through a small speaker at the relevant periods so as to increase the effectiveness of the deep sleep in regenerating the body and mind\\n\\xa0\\nSince deep sleep occurs mostly at the beginning of sleep, I\\'m going to try falling asleep listening to some delta waves. You can use anything that will play music. If you search youtube for \"delta wave sleep\" or \"binaural beats\", there are lots of selections to choose from\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEar plugs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUsing electronics at night definitely has an effect on sleep and deep sleep. I\\'ve used a freeware program on android and windows called F.lux. What it does is adjust the color spectrum of these devices to more naturally follow the changes of day and night.

After two days of taking it at bedtime, my deep sleep % has gone from 10 to 18. Maybe someone else will get similar results?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Try Prebiotica before you go to sleep.

Shutting off the screens about 90 minutes before bed. 2. Drinking homemade \"sleepy tea\" with chamomile, valarian, lavender, hibiscus, red raspberry leaf and stevia. 3. Downloading the \"Calm\" app and doing at least a 5 minute meditation from their sleep options right before falling asleep. Also, having a routine that I am sticking to, which includes these things, plus writing a gratitude list and putting on on my humidifier/diffuser with lavender essential oil in it and reading if there\\'s time.

       " 'Hi\\xa0@Victamon\\xa0This excerpt from What should I know about Fitbit Sleep Stages\\xa0explains how your Fitbit device determines if you\\'re asleep:\\xa0Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep.I believe you get a sleep score when your Fitbit records about 3 hours of sleep. If it recorded you being in REM/light sleep and decent Restoration during that time,\\xa0 you could get a score around 65 since it calculates those as percentages of your sleep. I haven\\'t read anything so far that suggests your sleep score is weighted by the previous days\\' scores.\\xa0Like you, I have had nights where I know I was asleep but it wasn\\'t recorded by my Fitbit. I\\'ve also had times when my tracker recorded me as asleep when I\\'ve been reading a book or playing games on my tablet. Although I know that I can edit the sleep log, I don\\'t bother except to remove the erroneous extended sleep in the morning.\\xa0On most days, I wake up before I\\'m ready to get up, then lay in bed not moving much, which gets recorded as REM or light sleep. Knowing that I can \"fool\" my Fitbit so it records me as sleeping, I consider the sleep data as interesting but don\\'t rely on it to be extremely accurate.\\xa0The most important thing is that you feel refreshed and rested after your sleep.\\xa0\\n\\nRieko | N California USA MBG PE',\n",

       " \"Hello everyone!\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHow's everything going?\\xa0🤗\\n\\xa0\\nHave you heard about Narcolepsy before?\\xa0Narcolepsy is considered a neurological >nervous system< disorder that affects the brain’s ability to control sleep and wakefulness. \\n\\xa0\\nIf you have narcolepsy, you experience excessive daytime sleepiness and may have uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep “attacks” may occur during any type of activity and at any time of the day.\\n\\xa0\\nSymptoms of narcolepsy include:\\n\\xa0\\nDisrupted nighttime sleep: this symptom is described as frequent awakenings during the night.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAutomatic behavior:\\xa0this symptom is described as falling asleep for several seconds but continues to perform routine tasks, such as eating, talking, driving or writing, without any awareness or later memory of ever doing the task.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nExcessive daytime sleepiness: All patients with narcolepsy have this symptom. In general, this interferes with normal activities like work, school, home life, social activities every day. Although brief naps during the day may help you feel rested and alert, tiredness returns within one to two hours. People with this report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood and/or extreme exhaustion.\\n\\xa0\\nSleep paralysis:\\xa0this symptom is the inability to move or speak just before falling asleep or just after waking up. Episodes of sleep paralysis usually go away after a few seconds to a few minutes.\\n\\xa0\\nHere Are Some Tips To Stay Awake With Narcolepsy:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nRest Best at Night:\\xa0\\n\\nRelax before turning in. Avoid alcohol close to bedtime.\\nTry to go to bed at the same time each night.\\nIf you wake up during the night, avoid reaching for your phone or other electronics. Screens stimulate, not relax, you.\\n\\nWatch Your Carbs: Some people feel drowsy after a big meal. That can be especially true if you have narcolepsy. Limit sugar and other carbs to stay more alert. Eat smaller meals and snack on nuts, berries, and other nutritious foods in between.\\n\\xa0\\nMove around: walk around every 20 minutes or so to stay alert. If you work at a desk, get up and visit the break room.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nStand up when you read emails and texts.\\nWalk to the bathroom even if you don’t need to go.\\nPace while talking on the phone.\\n\\nKeep Cool: cold feet may help keep you awake.\\xa0One study found that people with narcolepsy tend to have warmer skin temperatures in their fingers and toes. Cooler hands and feet made the people in the study more alert. You can dial down your body warmth with special cooling clothing, by avoiding warm drinks or meals, or using fans to keep your hands and feet chilled.\\n\\xa0\\nExercise:\\xa0physical activity ramps up your metabolism but also may help you rest better at night. Find something you can enjoy and stick with at least 20 minutes per day. Think tai chi, dancing, weight training, gardening, swimming, or tennis.\\xa0Finish your workouts at least 3 hours before bedtime so you can wind down for restful slumber.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nSchedule Naps: try to take several cat naps of about 15-20 minutes every day. But cap your dozes to no more than 30 minutes.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThese are just a few tips that can help with Narcolepsy. I wonder if anyone else has more tips or more information about this topic. It'd be great to see and read comments about it\\xa0😴😊\\n\\xa0\\nHave a wonderful day!\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\",\n",

Those three months off can be important to help catch up on missing sleep. What you want is to \"reset\" your internal clock to get used to longer sleep during those months. I find getting a bunch of exercise helps keep my asleep longer. Once your body gets used to longer sleep, you can dial back the exercise, but at the beginning you can pour it on.\\xa0Also, things like keeping the bedroom cool and using blackout curtains to block light can help.

       " 'Since the sleep graph fiasco going on in another thread, a lot of users have spoken about using the Fitbit to track sleep disorders. \\xa0I\\'ve been doing that for quite a while, so figured I\\'d do a short write-up.\\xa0Remember that insomnia is a significant medical condition. \\xa0Minor, occasional insomnia is normal; long-term, chronic, and severe insomnia is dangerous, leading to brain damage and to dangerously-poor ability to function. \\xa0Always inform your doctor about your insomnia and any actions you\\'ve taken to remediate it; for extreme cases, find a qualified psychiatrist experienced in treating insomnia.\\xa0A little background on me.\\xa0Several months ago, I\\'d gone in for psychiatric care to treat ADHD. \\xa0I had a diagnosis and active medication until I was 16, and have been off drugs for about 15 years; it got really, really bad. \\xa0I knew I had some sleeping issues, but thought I\\'d resolved them—mostly.\\xa0At the time, my Fitbit (in Normal mode) was showing me as sleeping 5.5-6.5 hours per night. \\xa0Eventually I took the time to look at the graphs when I woke up, checking the times I\\'d awakened against the red spans on the graph. \\xa0It showed times I\\'d spend lying awake in bed as \"asleep\", and counted those.\\xa0Switching the\\xa0tracker used to Sensitive wasn\\'t 100% accurate, but it came close. \\xa0A few spots awake where I was asleep, and a few asleep where I was awake; and it highlighted the spans I\\'d spent lying awake as solid wake times.\\xa0That\\'s where I started trying to treat insomnia: \\xa0I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night and, near as I could tell without a sleep journal to accurately re-model all my sleep data, it\\'d been going on for over a year.\\xa0Along the way, I used some drugs, did some research, and learned a lot. \\xa0I\\'m schizoid, so I don\\'t have friends; I like information. \\xa0Pharmacology is fascinating, and sleep therapy is relevant.\\xa0Actigraphy Sleep TrackingFitbit provides wrist actigraphy sleep tracking, and some mild instructions about sleep tracking. \\xa0The instructions documented are as follows:\\xa0The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.The sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent restless or\\xa0awake.\\xa0This setting may be helpful for users who wake up feeling tired even though\\xa0their sleep history shows sufficient rest.It\\'s notable the directions given all suggest a\\xa0predictive strategy: \\xa0if you think you\\'ll have a sleep-disorder-laden night, you should set your Fitbit to Sensitive ahead of time. \\xa0That\\'s not entirely helpful, and so many Fitbit users with sleep disorders have\\xa0retroactively reset the setting for sleep segments after the fact.\\xa0One might wonder why it\\'s normally okay to count rolling over or shifting around as sleep, yet completely-inaccurate if you wake up feeling tired. \\xa0The answer has something to do with wrist actigraphy in the role of sleep tracking, on which a number of papers have been published.\\xa0A review of these studies published in 2004 in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine cites some discussion of sleep actigraphy\\'s detection of sleep and waking events.\\xa0More recently, Pollak and colleagues have suggested different ways to compute the performance of an actigraph’s ability to detect sleep and wake.21 They use “predicted value for sleep” (PVS) which is the proportion of actigraphic sleep epochs that are also classified as sleep by PSG, and use “predicted value for wakefulness” (PVW) which is the proportion of actigraphic wake epochs that are also classified as wakefulness by PSGEssentially, sleep actigraphy is metered against Polysomnography in the detection of sleep and wakefulness. \\xa0These are opposite states, and their detection is considered separate for good reason.\\xa0If a person sleeps well, then the great majority of the measured time is accurately measured as sleep. \\xa0Failure to detect wakefulness will only mis-detect a small amount of time, thus the total measurement will be quite-accurate.\\xa0If a person sleeps poorly, then failure to detect wakefulness will measure them as sleeping much more than they actually do; while failure to detect\\xa0sleep will only matter for a smaller portion of the measurement.\\xa0To measure actigraphy, the researchers score how frequently it concurs with Polysomnography on both counts. \\xa0Adjustments to actigraphy algorithms can change these both: \\xa0a more-sensitive algorithm will detect more-subtle motions as wake events, and a less-sensitive algorithm will detect sleep during higher periods of activity. \\xa0In essence, the algorithm is adjusted to suppress detection of one or the other.\\xa0Importantly, PVS measures if a sleep epoch measured by actigraphy is\\xa0also a sleep epoch in polysomnography. \\xa0If actigraphy detects wakefulness but polysomnography detects sleep, that doesn\\'t lower the PVS; it only counts against actigraphy if the actigraph claims sleep and the polysomnograph claims wakefulness. \\xa0The same\\xa0is true of PVW: \\xa0if the actigraph says you\\'re awake and the polysomnograph says your asleep, it counts against PVW.\\xa0That tuning has an important impact:\\xa0In these comparisons, low threshold actigraph algorithms (e.g., defining wake as occurring even when a small number of activity counts accumulated during the epoch) yielded the best accuracy rate and\\xa0PVS; however, as sleep efficiency diminished, accuracy rate diminished (evidence level 1A). Actigraph PVW was best with high threshold algorithms (e.g., defining wake as occurring when a large number of activity counts, such as 100, accumulated during the epoch) compared to low threshold algorithms but at a cost of lower accuracy and PVS.The above\\xa0essentially says:\\xa0If the actigraph is sensitive and detects you as awake more-often, then it will more-accurately detect sleep;If the actigraph is less-sensitive and detects you as asleep more-often, then it will less-accurately detect sleepThis sounds strange because \"accuracy\" is contextual: \\xa0it\\'s either inaccurately detecting sleep (sleep when awake) or it\\'s inaccurately detecting wake (wake when asleep). \\xa0If, of 100 sleep epochs, it detects 10 as sleep and 90 as awake, it\\'s got 100% PVS accuracy; the same analysis would detect 0% PVW accuracy.\\xa0This bit is rather important:To summarize, when compared to PSG, actigraphy was found to be valid and reliable for detecting sleep in normal, healthy adult populations but less reliable for detecting sleep as sleep became more disturbed (evidence level 2B).As I said in the beginning: \\xa0I notated the times I had woken up and validated against both graphs. \\xa0Neither is perfectly-accurate; likewise, blindly selecting graphs based on a feeling of how well you\\'ve slept is not necessarily accurate. \\xa0I\\'ve had nights where I slept poorly but got a more-accurate measure out of Normal graphs—especially as I recovered and started increasing\\xa0the restfulness of my sleep.\\xa0If you\\'re not keeping a dedicated sleep journal, at least check the time when you wake up and don\\'t fall right back asleep. \\xa0If you wake up and feel restless several minutes later, glance at your Fitbit. \\xa0It\\'s on your arm. \\xa0When you wake up and remember being awake for a\\xa0short (twenty minutes?) time at 1:25am and an extensive (hour or so) from 3:30am to nearly 5, look at the graphs and decide which best tells you your sleep\\xa0based on those WASO events.\\xa0Sleep Restriction\\xa0I\\'d found also that my sleep, even once treated with drugs, was terrible. \\xa0I slept enough, but not well. \\xa0I\\'d been trying to go to bed at 10pm, and I woke up around 8am; that\\'s a good 10 hours in bed, with 7 hours of sleep. \\xa0No fun there.\\xa0At some point I noticed I\\'d sleep better if I stayed up later. \\xa0That lead me to sleep restriction therapy, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\\xa0Sleep restriction is dead-simple:\\xa0Identify your average total sleep time for the week;Identify the time you want to wake up;Stay up until you\\'ve got just enough time to sleep (maybe +15 minutes);When your average sleep efficiency exceeds 90% over a\\xa0week, move your bed time back 15 minutes;If your sleep efficiency falls below 80% over a week, stay up 15 minutes later;Do this consistently, every day.I handle sleep latency separately. \\xa0The Fitbit has historically calculated total sleep time by ignoring the time in bed spent falling asleep—it cuts off the sleep latency and starts from there. \\xa0I use that measurement. \\xa0If my sleep latency increases, I keep trying; if it\\'s stubborn or large, I delay my bedtime so I\\'m not lying in bed awake for an hour. \\xa0Sleep latency might take a week to come down after daylight savings time, for example; if it takes longer, I move my bedtime up an hour and start again from there.\\xa0Pharmacological Intervention\\xa0Drugs can help you sleep; drug therapy also brings risks and trade-offs. \\xa0Those trade-offs can be unacceptable.\\xa0I\\'ve gone through a lot of drugs. \\xa0You\\'ll have to ask a psychiatrist for some help here; my experiences won\\'t necessarily be yours.\\xa0Melatonin receptor agonists include Melatonin, as well as Ramelteon (e.g. Rozarem). \\xa0Melatonin is OTC; Ramelteon requires a prescription.\\xa0Dosing melatonin is hard; higher doses disrupt sleep. \\xa0At my worst, I needed literally 20mg 8-hour release to sleep; currently I do best with 2mg of 8-hour bi-phasic release. \\xa0Melatonin dosages around 0.3mg (300mcg) instant-release can be far more-effective than doses around 1mg; some research shows 2mg of 8-hour continuous-release is effective with no tolerance or rebound insomnia in the elderly.\\xa0Orexin Antagonists currently only include Suvorexant (e.g. Belsomra). \\xa0This is a new drug. \\xa0It worked fantastically for me, cutting my sleep latency to an easy 20 minutes; for most people, it doesn\\'t do anything until you take enough to make you groggy. \\xa0Suvorexant has a 9-hour half-life and will stay with you all day; maybe in the future they\\'ll make one with a 1-2.5-hour half life that can knock you out and then leave your body. \\xa0It\\'s C-IV, no rebound, no withdrawal; you\\'ll need a prescription, and it\\'s expensive so your insurance company won\\'t want to pay for it.\\xa0GABA Drugs are generally alpha-GABA-receptor positive allosteric modulators. \\xa0They bind to the receptor and cause it to react more-strongly to GABA. \\xa0There are also GABA reuptake inhibitors such as Tiagabine, which increase the amount of GABA in your brain. \\xa0Prescription required, for obvious reasons.\\xa0GABA PAMs include benzodiapezines such as Diazepam (e.g. Valium) and Lorazepam, as well as non-benzodiapezines like Zolpedim (e.g. Ambien) or Eszopiclone (e.g. Lunesta). \\xa0These drugs can work; they can also have horrible side-effects, including memory loss, sleep driving, and hallucinations. \\xa0Eszopiclone made me\\xa0incredibly high 24/7, and I almost drove into another car in a hypnotic state 20 hours after my last dose; I stopped, and went through one day of withdrawal—tachycardia, tremors, sweating, anxiety, depression, and the sensation of sunburn without sensitivity to touch and heat. \\xa0Your mileage may vary; don\\'t abuse these things,\\xa0never mix with alcohol.\\xa0Magnesium is also a GABA PAM, apparently, hence why ZMA is marketed as a sleep-promoting drug. \\xa0Use ZMA long enough and you\\'ll have trouble sleeping when you stop taking it; it is, fortunately, not Valium.\\xa0Atomoxetine is an ADHD drug. \\xa0I\\'m on that now. \\xa0It\\'s a norepinephrin and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), weaker on serotonin. \\xa0It seems to have sharply-diminished my insomnia, so I\\'m now managing that with melatonin and sleep restriction. \\xa0It\\'s been prescribed off-label for insomnia, but it\\'s not necessarily an insomnia medication; I\\'m uncertain by what mechanism it\\'s helping me.\\xa0Whether you\\'re using prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs,\\xa0talk to your doctor. \\xa0Insomnia can be crippling; in extreme cases, you may want to employ a psychiatrist—potentially, a sleep specialist.\\xa0f you have insomnia and ADHD, try to get away from the stimulants; amphetamine will seriously destroy your sleep. \\xa0Modafinil actually works quite-well for ADHD and frequently doesn\\'t upset people\\'s sleep, despite being a eugerogic;\\xa0do not use Modafinil to stay up for days straight. \\xa0I used Modafinil for my ADHD before I started treating the insomnia, and it drove me to suicidal depression suddenly and with no warning (I don\\'t respond to that kind of thing, so I observed it as an interesting and\\xa0unpleasant\\xa0data point and returned the drugs to my psychiatrist); if you get it in your head to stay up for a week straight on your shiny new ADHD drugs, you are screwing up badly.\\xa0CconclusionsManaging insomnia is a combination effort between information tracking (e.g. sleep actigraphy, sleep journals), cognitive behavioral therapies (e.g. sleep restriction, sleep environment), and drug therapy.\\xa0You should definitely report your insomnia to your doctor; for significant cases, you should find a psychiatrist to help treat it. \\xa0Drug therapies carry risks, and can be used safely and effectively for a large subset of patients; you and your psychiatrist need to determine if the drugs are necessary, effective, and\\xa0safe for you.',\n",

Take a few weeks to tweak your habits, and track your sleep each night to see if your lifestyle changes are adding up to more Zzzs.\\n\\xa0\\n1. Turn off the lights\\xa0Not just your main lighting, all those electronics with power lights or digital clocks should be dimmed or powered down\\xa0as much as possible. If you can’t block out the light in your bedroom, consider\\xa0wearing a sleep mask.\\n2. Unplug yourself\\xa0Watching TV or browsing your smartphone or tablet can keep your mind awake, and your body right along with it. Avoiding certain devices right before bed might\\xa0help you fall asleep faster.\\n3. Go to bed at a reasonable time\\xa0Start getting ready for\\xa0bed a little bit earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. But be careful with this one. The last thing you want to do is lie in bed tossing and turning because your body isn’t ready to fall asleep. Instead of jumping the gun by, say, a whole hour, chip away at it in 10 to 15 minute intervals until it feels right. But more importantly…\\n4. Set a Sleep Schedule\\xa0Going to bed at the\\xa0same time every night\\xa0can help you fall asleep faster. Your\\xa0body craves regularity and keeping your circadian clock dialed in is extremely important for\\xa0upholding quality sleep. As your body adjusts, you should be waking up naturally at the optimal time each morning as well, as long as you’re getting enough sleep. If you have time to experiment going to bed at different times, even better! You can find the time that works best for you.\\xa0Set\\xa0alarms on your Fitbit device.\\xa0Bedtime and wake-up reminders, which are calculated based on your sleep logs, can help you achieve a more consistent sleep cycle.\\n5. Keep it cool\\xa0Studies show\\xa0it’s easier to fall asleep when the temperature is cooler. If it’s too hot, or too cold, it can be more difficult.\\n6. Cut back the caffeine & alcohol\\xa0Try limiting caffeine intake to just mornings.\\xa0Caffeine\\xa0can affect your sleep for hours after drinking it! Studies have shown that\\xa0drinking alcohol before bed\\xa0may help you fall asleep faster, but it will also cause you to toss and turn— or wake up—more throughout the night as well, bringing down your overall sleep quality.\\n7. Get active\\xa0Hitting your daily step goal\\xa0 can help you sleep better, too. Try making an effort to\\xa0workout\\xa0during the day, and your sleep quality should improve, too.\\n8. Stay positive\\xa0Learning how to destress and having a positive outlook is the best thing you can to improve your overall health and your sleep. Find simple ways to unwind at the end of the day—a walk in nature, a breathing session with Relax—so you can ease into slumber and have a great night’s sleep.\\n\\xa0\\nHave a great day! \\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\",\n",

Work fatigue is an event that isn't relieved by rest and a constant state of weariness that reduces your energy, motivation and concentration.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLet’s take a closer look at what causes work fatigue and what you can do to stop being so sleepy at work.\\n\\xa0\\nNot enough or poor sleep: This is one of the main causes of Work Fatigue and this is due to a lack of adequate of sleep.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nInsufficient downtime: Sometimes we are sitting in from of a computer looking at the screen, while we can blame a portion of that on work, most of us usually spend hours attached to our mobile devices or laptops.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nThis does not only affect the ability to get a proper rest (device that emit blue light like phones, tablets, and laptops can also reduce sleep quality and increase depression, and stress) but it is actually confirmed that when not being able to fully disconnect from work is a major source of work-related fatigue.\\n\\xa0\\nA few ways to fight work fatigue and regain your energy all day long:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nManage your motivation: It is necessary to create your own workspace and your brain to self-motivate. Let's start by changing up your workspace to reduce clutter and make it more action-oriented. Taking into consideration that Clutter provides distractions and therefore, unmotivated.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTake more breaks during the day: Taking breaks can help to improve your productivity or combating fatigue. The human body follows a rest-activity cycle around every 90-120 minutes. At night, that cycle takes through the different stages of sleep. During the day, it manages the energy and alertness levels.\\n\\xa0\\nThis means is that your body craves a break to rest and recover after about 90 minutes of work. Once you understand this rhythm, you can use it to your advantage by scheduling your breaks so you are resting and recovering when your body needs it most.\\n\\xa0\\nDevelop some meditation routines: Some studies have determine that Yoga and meditation can help to decrease the stress and anxiety that lead to work fatigue.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nYou don’t have to relegate yourself to feeling tired at work all the time. Instead, determine the cause of your work fatigue and try one of these solutions.\\n\\xa0\\nHope someone else can share more tips about how to manage work-fatigue\\xa0😊\\n\\xa0\\nSee you around.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\",\n",

       " \"Hello.\\xa0😊\\n\\xa0\\nImagine that it's too late and you can't sleep, here we go again, 😅 often go to the sofa and attempt drowsing off to go back to bed, time goes and the it's already 5 am. Your eyes are tired and yet, you still can't sleep. Finally, an hour later you head back to bed and finally fell asleep.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOkay, let's try to fix this and make sure you get a good night's sleep. Here are some tips:\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n1. First, prepare your bedroom so it becomes the perfect place to sleep. Your bed needs to be at a good quality, good enough that when you lay on it you feel very comfortable, a good pillow is important too, to properly support you. In addition to this, there are different pillows, Thick, Thin, Firm, soft and find out what's best for you.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2. Lighting is important, but if your room is too light even at midnight, might be one of the reasons you can't sleep well. If there are windows, you can use some thick black curtains and put those and that will do the trick.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3. Also, the best you can do is to choose a bed time, set an alarm 1 or 2 hours before going to bed and when it goes off, it's your time to turn off all those electronic devices. Well, you don't have to turn them off, but at least stop using them. The Blue light coming out of the screens can affect your sleep, instead pick up a book and there will be a chance you're going to fall asleep with it on your face\\xa0😂 and you might even dream about it.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n4. Exercise, it has been mentioned before and it really helps your Sleep and Night. One of the exercises to improve your sleep is Cardio, so go out to the park and run for a while. Exercise will help you to stay awake in the day and no more feeling that you want to take a nap at the middle of the day\\xa0😬.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5. For naps, please be careful with those and avoid them after 3:00 PM. If you really want to take a nap, do it earlier in the afternoon, use an alarm and only sleep for 15 o 20 minutes.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n6. It happens that when you go to bed, you're looking at the celling, trying to fall as sleep, you might sometimes feel dizzy and that something is nor right. So, if you're feeling this way, there is currently an easy solution to this and place one of your feet on the ground and you'll fee better after some deep breaths.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5. Finally, eat some meals with carbs, at least 4 hours before bed. It might help with your sleep.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCan you share which other tips have you been practicing to get a good night's Sleep? Have you found any helpful tip in the Sleep Well board or in different threads?\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nLooking forward to reading your comments!\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\",\n",

I was very excited to use it to see ways I can optimize my REM sleep, however upon the first night of use, I had the absolute worst night of sleep I have had in a long time.After almost 2hrs of trying to get to sleep, I ended up having to take the Versa completely off to get into any sort of deep sleep.\\xa0In fact, I doubt I had any sort of REM sleep because I woke up so many times throughout the night. The Versa did accurately track those 2hrs of restlessness. Does anyone else have this issue or advice to resolve it? I am a petite person and have a very small wrist (I keep the device in the 4th notch from the watch face) if that provides any insight and I tried to adjust the Versa band where it can still track, but still wasn't too tight. If I find that this device just isn't compatible for my sleep, I will likely return it for something less intrusive like an Oura ring.\",\n",

An exercise regimen should always be enjoyable, it should never feel like punishment. Losing weight because your starving yourself and punishing yourself with streneous and lengthy exercise routines\\xa0is no fun for anyone; losing weight because you're becoming more active by doing things you like doing is an essential prerequisite to a permanent paradigm shift from sedentary to a more active and healthy lifestyle.\\xa0Of course, keeping your diet in check is also important, especially if you significantly increase your activity level, which would probably call for more fuel.\\xa0\\xa0Hope this helps.

       " \"Hello!\\xa0What I liked to read here is that there is some audio filter that can be trained with bruxism noise and use my phone to try to detect it. Perhaps some low-noise high-sensitivity microphone hanging over my bed would make sense. Probably I'm in a specific sleep phase, that probably the Fitbit can detect. So here we have the potential to interrupt the bruxism phase by some vibrations in the Fitbit.\\xa0(Dito idea for the snoring ones of us;)\\xa0Where do I read from these ideas ? Is the API to Fitbit usable for this?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Now to the reasons for bruxism and some alternative was to see on it:\\xa0I have read a lot about MCAS, mast cell activation disorder. Bruxism is on the symptom list.\\xa0It is related to histamine intolerance, but stems from mast cells that are way to sensitive (to heat, cold, vibration/scratching on the skin, to all kinds of chemicals to skin or stomach, to a lot of medicine that releases histamine or is related to histamine or other mast cell expressed messenger substances. But depending on age and severity, only some of the long list of symptoms may occur. The longer the symptoms are known, the more severely they get for MCAS and the more organs are involved. (Childhood: bowel symptoms, sometimes only bad after parties (to much sweets, to much histamine or Theorin in chocolate), youth: lung, skin; later: arthritic symptoms, tinnistus, bruxism, heart stutters, bad headaches, neurologic symptoms of AHD, Autism or schizophrenia, etc...)\\xa0Use the list of borrelia b. based Lyme disease, and you have the picture. But: MCAS have 5-10% of the population. Nearly 0% now it. (Lyme D.: 0,03%)\\xa0One symptom is high muscular tones, leading to symptoms of fibromyalgia, and in this vicinity also to bruxism.By the way, high tension in the neck under the ear often produces tinnitus, because some 1/3 of population has a vital part of inner ear blood circulation by arteries leading between the neck muscles.Therefore that is remedied by massage of the neck and vibrating massage of the ear canal by keeping the ear closed with a finger on the tragus and pumping gently inward. And by manual therapy and Craniosacral methods of balancing our large bowl on the neck a-new.\\xa0Diagnostic therapy:Leave out all mast cell activating substances, like any alcohol even in small amounts (therefore low-carb \\xa0anti-yeast diet, since yeast produce alc inside you as well), iodine in salt, folic acid in vitamins and supplements (widely spread to donate some folic acid here and there...)\\xa0Try Levoceterizine 2-4/d for a month. Combine with antioxidants like Vitamin C (retard or depot, since you should take 0,5-1,5g/d, to protect your teeth and bowel mucosa).Also try all mast cell taming things like curcumine, thyme, tryptophane, cumin oil, etc..\\xa0\\xa0Therefore also try to clean up your bowel, i.e.: bind toxics and feed the right bacteria, Lactobacillae and Bifidae. This is most effectively done by praebiotics named galctooligosaccharides, as I found here:\\xa0Wolz Curabiom baby:https://www.wolz.de/produkte/darmgesund-fuer-eine-gesunde-darmfunktion/curabiomr-baby/(It's a google translate link above the link of the original link of the manufacturer. They also produce good probiotics, that helped me to get my immune system fit against infections, but not to alter my biome in my bowels, very inert to change. So I have to live with the beasts I was given between birth and 1yr old, where the biome stabilizes, minus all I have lost due to antibiotics that often eradicate one or other stem from your biome. I always ask myself: if I really have to take antibiotics, why not freeze in some sample of my biome? Perhaps to cheap a remedy...)\\xa0If symptoms get slightly better, investigate further. It's a detective's game! Never give up. You have the right to be well and feel good! 😉\\xa0Of course you have to do the list of differential diagnosis for MCAS to exclude any problem leading to the same symptoms, to find a more ground based diagnosis and based on this profound therapy.\\xa0Most important is to find out what you do not tolerate, any allergies, especially food allergies, second food intolerances. This may change if your balance is re-gained, so try out some years later.\\xa0But to sum it up: lend some wisdom from the really old therapeutic systems, as you like, choose TCM or Ayurveda, and change your epigenetic program, e.g. \\xa0by meditation. I think in TCM you could search for kidney energy build-up treatment.A more scientific approach was given by Pruimboom: Wirkkochbuch in his Literature List, if interested, pm me. But the scientist investigating MCAS also draw conclusions in the direction of epegenetics.Eg. search for Prof. Molderings & epigenetic.\\xa0For the spiritually inclined lending towards belief in a higher being, I found some analogies on the way relief of sins is discussed e.g. in the bible. While zapping I sometimes listen to pastor Joseph Prince from newcreationchurch.org and find his preaching somehow, on a high level, related to my search for cures for MCAS. Don't be fixated to one way of thinking here. Sometimes I stand upon one leg (The Tree in yoga) and pray a father in heaven. This gave me some aha-effect not only once.\\xa0\\xa0Good luck!\\xa0Andi\",\n",

You should make sure that you always have a full day of activity. Always stay active. Exercising is great if you can never get enough sleep. It will tire you out and make you tired for bed. I also recommend to lose the electronics at least an hour before bed. No phone, no tablets, and try not to watch the television. Pick up a book instead. If you don't have books, that's sad. Go to your nearest library to borrow some books to read before bed. You can also buy books at your local book store. I recommend Barnes and Noble. But my point is, no screens before bed. Do not take sleep medicine unless it was prescribed by your doctor. Not even Melotonin or any other sleep aid or sleep vitamin. If you want to sleep well every night, you need to get it into a schedule. That also means to get to bed at a certain time every night and wake up at a certain time every morning.

Exercise regularly: moderate exercise on a regular basis, such as swimming or walking, can help relieve some of the tension built up over the day. But make sure you do not do vigorous exercise, such as running or the gym, too close to bedtime, as it may keep you awake.\\n\\xa0\\n2. Create a restful sleeping environment: your bedroom should be a peaceful place for rest and sleep. Temperature, lighting and noise should be controlled so that your bedroom environment helps you to fall (and stay) asleep. If you have a pet that sleeps in the room with you, consider moving it somewhere else if it often disturbs you in the night.\\n\\xa0\\n3. Do not over-indulge: too much food or alcohol, especially late at night, can interrupt your sleep patterns. Alcohol may help you to fall asleep initially, but it will disrupt your sleep later on in the night.\\n\\xa0\\nSee you around.\\xa0\\n\\n\\tWilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.\",\n",

They are only funny numbers that I get with it.And I'm even more reluctant to get the coach, because I'm using, in my opinion, the best coaching fitness application there is. The freeletics coach. And I'm paying for it.So if there's a reason you know what the app would give me and I wouldn't have to get the coach, then I'm interested.\",\n",

       " \"Hi guys. Ok so me and my friend have the same Charge HR. The sleep tracker on mine works fine and is accurate. I have a toddler that wakes at night and I always have bad sleep. Its the one with the few thin blue lines (5h18) and I know is correct. My friend sleeps great, he takes meds and is knocked out all night, he's rested and feels good but he constantly gets these weird patterns that are full of thick blue lines all night (4h25), there is no way he is sleeping that little. What is happening? He is a tummy sleeper if that matters, is he wearing it wrong, something else? We thought it was just defective but I switched Fitbits with him and we got the same thing. So its how he is wearing it or how he is sleeping...\\xa0Correct (mine):\\xa0[IMG]http://i68.tinypic.com/241oytj.png[/IMG]\\xa0Messed up (his):[IMG]http://i65.tinypic.com/2me22p5.png[/IMG]\\xa0Any idea what could be causing this and how to get him to have accurate readings? Thanks!\",\n",
       " 'You had exactly my question. Did you ever get an answer? In a 7.5 hour night, I sometimes have 170 - 190 \"restless\" minutes. Only 5-7 episodes, no awake periods show, but way more than the 25-30 minutes they say is \"normal.\"I take no sleep aids. But because of my restless periods my fitbit subtracts 3 hours and calls my sleep 3-4 hours. Do I have a problem?!? (2 years ago my restless periods were not as long.)',\n",
