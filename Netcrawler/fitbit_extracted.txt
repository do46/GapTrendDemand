As long as the line is green and below the 'High' line, that means your EOV is low (or at least not high), which is good.  When line goes above 'High', graph turns yellow, at least on Android - can't guarantee graph looks same on IOS. 3.

Using an Inspire 2 tracker.  Consistently, EVERY night, I get a spike in my heart rate that falls mostly in the fat burn range but sometime goes into the next level.  The duration is variable, sometimes only one reading, sometimes spanning as much as 15 min.  It always occurs when the tracker indicates I am in light sleep but a few times during deep sleep (when the duration is longer).  Most curious, it always happens between 1 and 1:45 am,  I cannot correlate this with anything.  Any thoughts?
@tdlopez74.. but you can change the time of your step reminders if you use that feature...

They all do different things.  From the fitbit article  WHAT DOES EACH SLEEP STAGE MEAN?Fitbit’s sleep researchers and the National Sleep Foundation describe the following sleep stages. The names of the stages are what we’ve chosen to use in your Fitbit sleep log. LIGHT SLEEPLight sleep serves as the entry point into sleep each night as your body unwinds and slows down. This stage typically begins within minutes of falling asleep. During the early part of light sleep, you may drift between being awake and asleep. You may be somewhat alert and can be easily awoken. Breathing and heart rate typically decrease slightly during this stage.  Light sleep promotes mental and physical recovery.DEEP SLEEPDeep sleep typically occurs in the first few hours of sleep. When you wake up feeling refreshed in the morning, you’re likely to have experienced solid periods of deep sleep during the previous night. During deep sleep, it becomes harder to be awakened since your body becomes less responsive to outside stimuli. Breathing becomes slower and muscles relax while heart rate usually becomes more regular. Adults may see a normal decrease in deep sleep as we get older, though sleep patterns vary among people. Deep sleep promotes physical recovery and aspects of memory and learning. This stage has also been shown to support your immune system. REM SLEEPThe first phase of REM sleep typically occurs after you’ve had an initial stage of deep sleep. You generally stay in REM sleep for a longer period of time during sleep cycles occurring in the second half of the night. During this final stage of sleep, your brain becomes more active. Dreams mainly occur during REM sleep, and your eyes move quickly in different directions. Heart rate increases and breathing becomes more irregular. In principle, muscles below the neck are inactive to avoid acting out dreams.REM sleep has been shown to play an important role in mood regulation, learning, and memory as your brain processes and consolidates information from the previous day so that it can be stored in your long-term memory.
I was late as well 😞 will the spo2 data be used for this new sleep score?
That beautiful Sleep Score that appeared on our Fitbit devices today was a brilliant idea to make people not feel bad about themselves first thing in the morning. Without a possibility to opt out! Yaass! Seeing someone grading me according to some abstract " ideal sleep" and showing me that probably I should be feeling unwell and not very productive during the day because I haven't hit someone's made up standard tonight, was such a great and motivating start of my day today, that I came up with an idea - let's go further and introduce Weight Score! Or better, FAT SCORE! Let's show people this Poor or Meh label not only on the sleep screen, but everywhere across the app, preferably at the top of the screen and with some giant flashy number, authoritatively confirming how Poor someone did and how Meh they should feel. Preferably every morning! Just like that brilliant, forced and into-your-face sleep score you can't hide from, Fat Score would motivate people work harder and reach their goals faster, to finally hit that standard put out there by someone at some glossy FIT-the-standard-or-die-BIT magazine. Right? What do you think? Great idea? Isn't it the same idea behind the sleep score, that was forced on everyone, without a possibility to hide it?

I have narcolepsy and sometimes my graph looks similar to that, but I never get that much rem. If I get more than 12% rem it usually means I had a nightmare. I also don’t get a lot of deep. I would share a screenshot but I’m not seeing that option. Try comparing your % to the benchmark.
Hello.Can anyone explain how to read my sleep data? I have a new Fibit Surge, and set it the for the first 2 days on regular and at the last 3 days on sesitive. Thank you...
I’ve attempted to reply with it to the e mail notification I got if thtat would be of any help 🙈
Good tips @Loser-Girl . I’d like to add one more that I find helpful. Most Fitbit devices offer a feature called Relax, which guides you thru a deep breathing exercise for 3 or 5 minutes. I do it every night when I get into bed. I also find it helpful when things get too stressful.
hmm, I cant say I have heard this happening before. there have been reports of phantom steps but I don't recall seeing sleep pattern. I have never gone to bed without my tracker so I also can't speak from experience. Maybe do an experiment to see if it happens again.. do one night completely off and do one night half and half (if you happen to wake up, take it off) and see what data you get?

How do I log out of the app? Having this same issue.
I know you wrote this years ago, but this has really opened my eyes.  I generally work on about 5 hours of sleep.  My REM, Light and Deep are pretty similar to yours.  33mins Awake / 29 min REM / 3hr 24min Light / 35 min Deep.  It's amazing how close we are!I also always thought I wasn't quite right, since I didn't get all the sleep that most people get.  Even if I try to sleep in, I tend to wake up around 6:30.  This even happens if I travel and the timezone is 5 hours different.  I still wake up around that time without using an alarm clock.Yet, there is one major difference between us.  I ALWAYS feel tired.  I have gone to the doctors asking for help.  They have checked my iron levels and said I was fine.  There was nothing they could do for me.  It's been a major frustration for me.  Even though I feel like I should have more sleep, I just plain don't sleep more.Anyway, thanks for the article.  It was interesting thinking about this being a possible genetic difference.
I did not use that option......so
I've already been to this website and tried all these things. Sometimes I can do all the right things and still not sleep well. But I worked for years on night shift and stress/pain has interfered with my sleep quality also. The OP is saying they sleep a lot but don't achieve enough deep sleep  I though this was interesting. From what I can tell deep sleep tends to occur at the beginning of the sleep cycle. The best thing for me is getting to bed at a decent hour. I am slowly but surely improving sleep duration and quality and have been using the fitbit to track the progress for a few months. It's the main reason I got it really.
4 hours sleep awake 3 times restless 15. Certainly no doubtthe sleep is not of good quality.We will develope a plan to change the pattern.The sleep tracker will be my best tool
It's recommended to use the normal setting unless you have a known sleep disorder.

When I first got sleep stages I had them every night for the first couple weeks.  Now I only get them a 1 or 2 times a week.  I read all about them, and understand about not getting 3 consecutive hours, but I really don't think I wake up all that often that I would not stay asleep for 3 hours.  I don't know if it's something wrong on my end or something with Fitbit.  It's disappointing, but like someone else said, not a deal breaker.
@Merkillin I'm still playing around with Custom Activities and examining my Sleeping HR. I have extracted 45 minutes using the Custom Activity. As I'm typing this my HR is 57 bpm. and today's RHR is below

Fitbit does not accommodate settings for a narcoleptic. If you notice you will never go into REM within an hour of falling asleep according to your Fitbit. Even though you actually are in REM  I have been through a sleep study@JeanetteLH wrote:I know that a lot of you like to compare your sleep patterns to others' so you can see if your sleep is in the normal range. A lot of you suspect that you may have a sleeping disorder such as Narcolepsy or Hypersomnia. From what I've read, experts believe that there are many people suffering with undiagnosed sleeping disorders, so don't be afraid to bring this up to your physician, and advocate for yourself. My primary care physician initially just thought I was tired because I had four small children. Fortunately (well, in terms of getting a diagnosis is was fortunate), I was suffering from some other symptoms that pointed to more of a sleeping disorder as opposed to just the daytime sleepiness, so he referred me to a Pulmonologist who speacialized in Sleep Medicine. I did an overnight sleep study and a sleep latency nap study the following day. The criterion for a diagnosis of Narcolepsy (at least it was in 2006) is a sleep latency (time it takes to fall asleep) of less than five minutes for five naps (20 minutes max length) that are spaced two hours apart, and you must enter REM sleep in at least two of the five naps.  Here is a sampling of my sleep patterns according to my FitBit. I've definitely seen a lot worse on here. LOL That's why I'm posting this so that some of you might feel confident enough to tell your docs that you think there might be something more than just your average sleepiness. Now, I will say that part of the problem for Narcoleptics is not spending enough time in the most restorative stages of the sleep. Fitbit only records "restless" and "deep sleep" and of course it's not based on brain waves, so there's no way to know when you've been in REM sleep, etc. However, it gives you a pretty good idea of the amount of sleep you're getting. I tried to include a wide sampling, showing some of my best and worst nights. Also, I  have it set to sensitive and dominant hand, but wear it on my non-dominant wrist to see if sensitivty was decreased. I've worn it on both wrists with the same settings and I don't think I noticed a huge difference. Have fun analyzing!                   and I know that I immediately go to REM and stay there 98% of the time.

Sleep scores are pretty good on nights between 7 to 7.5, in fact about the same as when I get 8 (score is worse when I get below 7 and I also feel worse, so I know at least 7 is what I should shoot for). Thanks for your thoughts! I'll adjust my schedule for the next week to aim for no more than 7.5 and see if that helps the nights of insomnia go away.
As someone older, I am having to get up at night to go to the restroom. That is part of my life. The sleep algorithm built into the sleep function trashes the sleep that I had before getting up to do my business. The sleep data that the app is showing underestimates the amount of sleep that I am actually getting. If I were a conspiracy theorist I would say that Fitbit is deliberately giving every customer the idea that they are getting much less sleep than they actually are getting.  The explanations for the sleep analysis does not dig into the facts of the matter, things like how you correlate the heart beat data with the brain wave activity is nonexistent. That is the basis of your justification of doing this kind of analysis using a substtute measure, and yet the explanation is ambiguous and the justification is: You just have to trust us.  Really not science and very duplicitous.
Edson,Thank you for the suggestion, but that did not work either. My Surge isstill not automatically logging my sleep. Unfortunately, I have given upand just do it manually each night. Is this something the engineers areworking to improve?Angel
@RachelMary:There are supplements you could try. The most well known (perhaps most "popular") is melatonin. I use it and one tablet (500mcg - 500 micrograms) usually knocks me out. Also calcium supplements are known to enhance sleep. I'm taking "Tums" as a calcium supplement (it's really just a calcium tablet, since calcium carbonate is also an ant-acid). One thing that really made me want to reply to this post is the fact that I also started taking higher doses of vitamin D supplements. I think this is really helping me to re-establish a circadian rythm (that's just fancytalk for "regular sleeping pattern"). I am wondering if a lot of us urbanized folks are suffering from vitamin D deficiancy and that's what's causing a lot of these sleep disorders. Anyhow, the vitamin D really seems to be making my sleep more fulfilling. I still sleep only a few hours, but I wake up more easily, am more rested all day through, and my sleep seems less fitful. At least my Fitbit seems to think so. Less restlessness. Try vitamin D supplements. Increase the dose gradually every day, and monitor your Fitbit's sleep analysis. See if your restlessness goes down and see if you start feeling better. When you reach the level of sleep regularity that you're comfortable with, start tapering off the vitamin D. See how much you can reduce the dose before your sleep begins to become restless again. Hope this helped. Good luck with it. B"H. PS: here's a link to the Google results on vitamin D and sleep:Google: sleep+vitamin+d
I set my flex to sleep mode when i get in bed. In the morning when i sync it, it shows that i hve been in bed much longer than i actually was. I usually go to bed at 10 pm, but my flex says that sometimes i go to bed much earlier than that. It is recording me as sleeping when i am driving home from work, or when i'm sitting watching TV, even though I have not put it into sleep  mode. How can I  get the most accurate log of my actual sleep?
@RCPaul712 wrote:I don't think you understand my question.

In the title you stated "fall asleep time" so I replied to that. But I realise you would like the data you mentioned in this post be exported, and the only way I can get to that is view the day's sleep record on the phone or the PC.

Agreed! I don't like the sleep score either. It makes me feel like I'm being judged. I have no problems with sleep but getting a bad score seems like a good way to start.
Should this be posted in a different forum?
I switched my sleep mode to sensitive, and now it says I'm only sleeping 4+ hours out of the 9 hours I'm in bed.  I know I'm a restless sleeper, but this doesn't seem right.  Anyone else experienced this?
Solution: Get a Jawbone UP24This topic has been getting a lot of activity lately.  It seems as though the programmers have not added those "3 lines of code" since I posted it 3 years ago.  Too much time spent on marketing and little on actual customer satisfaction and fixing usability issues. Since then I've tried the NikeFuelband SE which was even worse since they fired all their engineers last year and their app and website got even more buggy to the point of unusability. I have settled on the Jawbone UP24 which is probably the best tracker out there in terms of sleep from my experience.  [The Basis Peak looks even better but it is out of stock and I haven't tried it].  The Jawbone UP24 actually tracks your total sleep "per day" and gives you an accurate weekly average based on that, rather than tracking individual datapoints which skew the data if you deign to take any naps or wake up in the middle of the night and go back to sleep later.  Fully charged, it lasts 13 days!See picture below for yourself, I am very happy with it after all of these issues I've had with other trackers:

Thank you for the reply. I am actually in a monthly step competition with a bunch of people so I want to make sure to convert the good things that I am doing.  Not worried about tracking little stuff, but 15-20 minutes of weight lifting can add another 1,000ish steps for my count but I just don't know how to add that in yet.
Lately my Inspire HR sporadically keeps sleep stats. It recognizes that I'm sleeping, but doesn't keep any heart rate data during that time. One night it doesn't work, the next night it does. Any ideas? I have not had this issue until recently.
Hi all! I own a fitbit sense and I notice that the way sleep efficiency is calculated for the different type of sleep tracking (stages vs classic) is different. Does anyone know how is it calculated for each type of sleep tracking?
Hi, welcome to the Fitbit Community @Acea!  
 
I wouldn't use it too loose, becase it could affect the heart rate accuracy, but it shouldn't be too tight either. 
 
Could you provide a few extra details of what you've been experiencing? Do you feel the Fitbit device is tighter by the time you wake up? 
 
Here you can find some extra recommendations on how to use the device to sleep better as well. 
 
Keep me posted.

Isn't the point of the sleep log that it keeps track of restless sleep and not only logs the time you lay down to sleep and when you get out of bed? If so, the idea of a manual log would seem to defeat the purpose.  Mine is less than a week old and doesnt seem to work for sleep logging at all. Should I ask for a new one?  Or likely that the new one won't work either..?

Hi There I feel for you, I waken about a dozen times during the night, as Iam a very restless sleeper.Have been for a number of years now.This can be very annoying sometimes. I try stay up as late as I can  usually just until after 12pmI have found I get very tired about 6/7 pm at night and sometimes start dozing around 9 sometimes it helps.Liz
I also heard a lot of good things concerning CBD, never tried it however. Among my good friends had a hypersomnia and also if i remember it ideal medical professional banned him caffeine and alcohol, and likewise to remain awake much longer during the night. He had the exact same resting schedule every day for a long time. It improved at some point
I wonder why it says that?--Dimitri Crockett
According to this article by Fitbit, most users earn a sleep score between 72-83.  Since the score is out of 100, and the display on iOS shows up as a circle that I have failed to close, I am wondering if anyone has ever actually earned a sleep score of 100.   Is it actually possible to achieve this goal?  If so, how?  Were strong sleeping pills involved?   (Edit to add: No, I do not take sleeping pills, I do not drink, and I do not want to take any substances.  I made this comment because I believe the scoring system sets an impossible standard.  And no, I am not buying premium just to see the math). Honestly, even on a night when I slept for over 10 hours with plenty of deep sleep, my “score” was still only an 84.  It seems impossible to earn above the low 80s. It feels like I am taking one of those impossible “weed-out” classes in college where nobody earns above a B- and the prof doesn’t give As on principle.  Is that the model here?   If it’s not really possible to get a sleep score of 100, why is the sleep score configured to look like an achievable “goal” from which we have somehow fallen short?  If we are doing everything in our power to get good sleep, and we still cannot earn 100 or even 90, what’s the point of it?  Fitbit has been so useful for helping me to set and reach goals.  Why create a goal that is inherently unattainable?
Hello @rachelmulraneyy, @cathm. It's great to see you around! @cathm Thank you for your great input!
 
@rachelmulraneyy Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience. I understand how you feel since I also experienced a similar situation than yours, however, following some tips like the ones suggested by @cathm helped me to improve my sleep. 
 
Here are some additional tips: 
 
Pay attention to what you eat and drink: 
Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid heavy or large meals within a couple of hours of bedtime. Your discomfort might keep you up.
Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol deserve caution, too. The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can wreak havoc on quality sleep. And even though alcohol might make you feel sleepy, it can disrupt sleep later in the night.
 
Include physical activity in your daily routine
 
Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. Avoid being active too close to bedtime, however. 
Spending time outside every day might be helpful, too.
Know when to contact your doctor
Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night, but if you often have trouble sleeping, contact your doctor. Identifying and treating any underlying causes can help you get the better sleep you deserve.
 
Hope this helps.

I've been on CPAP for more than 5 years and am also an avid cyclist. I've been in the best shape in my life after starting CPAP. Cycling is a very aerobic sport so if there were any negative impact on lung capacity, I'm sure I would have noticed.Also, if you're new to CPAP and have questions, I recommend checking out the cpaptalk forums: http://www.cpaptalk.com/CPAP-Sleep-Apnea-Forum.html
I've had disarranged dozing as far back as I can recall. It began getting terrible in early grade school it's as yet something that I battle with. As far as I might be concerned, essentially all of my rest related issues are mental. I have an extremely tough time switching my mind off and really allowing myself to nod off. I'm not at all a specialist and you should take all of this with a tremendous grain of salt however I'd thought I'd share a portion of the stuff I've learned in a daily existence season of managing this.For me actually, I've observed that perusing as I'm attempting to rest has assisted me with nodding off. Perusing a section or two of an actual book, not something off of my telephone due to the blue light, helps me colossally as far as getting into 'the time has come to rest now' mentality.At the point when I'm truly battling to nod off I will take a couple of 10 mg tablets of melatonin. Melatonin is the chemical your body produces to control rest. This is anything but a resting pill and it won't take you out. It's likewise absolutely conceivable to essentially battle your direction through it, similar to a grumpy baby. You can track down a melatonin any place they sell nutrients, ordinarily supermarkets or drug stores. Additionally, very significant update that I'm not a specialist, that all bodies are unique, and you should converse with you Dr before you begin taking any enhancement!

Hello guys! Thanks for sharing the blog, Wilson! Several years ago, I was not really into yoga, because I thought I have no flexibility at all, and my maximum was working out, running and cycling. However, I did try yoga and after about the fourth time I liked it. I decided to try it after I read Johns Hopkins experts' studies about the benefits of yoga, where there was stated that it helps to relieve stress and improve sleep. I also find useful info about how to practice yoga at Yanvayoga.com, where they describe the best asanas and pranayamas for different purposes. I tried those to reduce stress and anxiety, and I can say that yoga really manages stress and relax my mind.
I'm struggling to get my sleep to be healthy.  For most of my life, I have been an insomniac and didn't really know how a lack of good quality sleep can hurt you. Thanks to the fitbit app, I have actually improved somewhat over the past few years.  Would anyone be willing to share a screenshot of their healthy sleep chart?  I would like to have a target of what I should strive for. Thanks in advance! Steve
Almost about 3 weeks ago I completed the sleep study from Fitbit. They said you'd get a code for premium but I never received one. Anyone know what's up with this? Thanks
heh, yes. my boyfriend, dog and 2 cats are in the bedroom. all of them sleep much sounder than me though.
Of course it matters. As for me, I frequently have insomnia, so I try to make everything comfortable for comfortable sleep.
Twitter response from @fitbitsupport @_georgia_anne Sorry for the inconvenience, Georgia! There's a bug causing this and it has already been reported - it should be fixed soon!
Love the new sleep stages.Over the last month or so, it seems to me that I am achieve a lot of deep sleep 23% compared to bench mark of 12-18% but on average significantly less REM about 15% which is the bottom of the benchmark 15-25%. Some nights this falls to about 11%.My time awake is below average.So much question is "Does it matter?"Is REM better than deep sleep? or vice versa? Or do they do different things?Thanks
I can so relate to this. So, first off, you are not alone! Secondly, I overcame it on my own, so there is a way out! And very good of you to speak up about it.I have anxiety and at one point I got anxiety mostly before bed and panic attacks about the fact that I could/would not sleep, which made it so much worse. Starting your night with a good hour of crying does not help. I am trying to remember what helped for me:1. Discovering that I am not my fear, but that I have a fear. Realising that I have thoughts and that I am not my thougts. So when I was thinking something that was created by the fear, I would try my best to change my thoughts to what I wanted to think. For me the fear actually sometimes felt like it was outside myself, like a voice or a monster in my head. So at times I would talk to it and tell it how wrong it was (or my boyfriend would ask me to say what the voice was saying and he would speak back, learned so many good come back lines for it from him).2. Doing 5 minutes of yoga before bed to calm the body down. You might not be in as much control over the mind as over you body, but they co-exist. And it is easier for the mind to be calm in a calm body. As well as phobias and anxiety having the tendency to create tension in your shoulders, neck and jaw, so it is good to try and release that.3. Do a breathing exercise before going to sleep. Now when I wake up in the middle of the night due to my anxiety I can calm myself back down by doing a combination of breathing exercise and child's pose. I am not saying you should not see a doctor. I don't know how much sleep you are getting at the moment and for the short term a sleep pill could help you out. I can only share my own experience. However, for the long term you will have to find a way to get this phobia under control. The doctor can also get you an appointment with a psychologist if you feel you could use help with this from one. One thing that I learned myself:Try not to go overboard with all the sleeping aids like tea, oils etc. etc. While they can help you fall asleep as they calm the body and nervous system, the problem for us is in our minds and I found that the more I relied on those kind of aids the stronger my mind became about not going to sleep.

Hi @Long72 and welcome to the community. I believe the reason you aren't seeing sleep stages is that kind of measurement requires a Fitbit with heart rate tracking, which the One doesn't have. The next time you wish to upgrade your Fitbit, I would definitely recommend getting one with heart rate tracking. Here's an article from Fitbit that goes into more detail about sleep tracking.

Hi
I'd love to see a site that recommended books and links to articles that help with managing our own health.  My sleep pattern is terrible and that's WITH a sleeping aid.
I also have the One and agree 100% with what you said about it Sevierflygirl. I also do not like the sleep band. The clip does not fit in it well and if you take the device out of the clip it falls out of the band (thus can go in the toilet...not good). I wear my One on a piece of leather around my neck and it tracks my sleep accurately when I stop moving around at night and logs any restlessness as awake time, which it probably is. Although I read in the help info that you can put the device into sleep mode by pressing the button and holding it in until the flashing stops, I do not see the advantage to this overall. The other people posting here, I am guessing, do not have the One. I chose it after reading the reviews on Amazon, and have never regretted my choice. I love it!

Seems good. Thank you
After years of being the butt of my family's snoring jokes and comments, I finally decided to get a sleep test and was diagnosed with at least slight obstructive sleep apnea last June 2020.  Due to COVID this diagnosis was based on an at home sleep device test over the course of one night only.  That is to say I did not have to spend a night in any sort of sleep observation room like many usually need to do to get insurance approved CPAP therapy and equipment. 
 
At times I think the CPAP therapy helps at times I'm not so sure. The Fitibt score and criteria definitely dive deeper and provide a better window into true overall sleep than my CPAP app's score, which is based solely on pressurization, lack of air leaks and time of use.
 
With that being said I recently started tracking and comparing my Fitbit Charge 4 sleep scores with when I do and do not use my CPAP machine.  I found that my Fitbit sleep scores are almost always significantly better when I do not use the CPAP.  Lately I've been trying to be more in tune with how I feel when I wake and throughout the day, and feel that I actually may be getting worse sleep using my air machine.  Anyone else in the FBC who may use CPAP and Fitbit sleep score's  see or think or feel anything like this?

Where do you see the benchmark info?  I have a charge 2 and though I see the sleep stages on my laptop, I don't seem to be able to access the benchmarks.
I bought a WoCase off amazon for the fitbit one it will make it like a fitbit flex.

Got it.  Found it and is working fine. Thank you
Kitsboy, this is good advice.  I changed the fitbit to my non-dominant arm.  Same results decreased hours asleep and restless.  Had my partner sleep with the fitbit.  His readings were great.  I think my results might be right.
@AmandaGeorge totally get it, I stress a lot too when I have exams coming. Thank you for adding your personal experience to this topic. 🤗

Manually, manually!  This is suppose auto and that was one of the reasons I found it attractive.  Sleep is as important to me as steps (well almost) since I have had problems with sleep my whole life.  The Fitbit registers I get between 3 to 4 hours a night which I do get more.  When I had my UP in my oppinion the sleep tracker on it was much more accurate but thats about it.  I like the Fitbit for others.  The UP registered "Light" sleep and @ "deep" sleep and I am wondering if the Fitbit sometimes registers "light" sleep as "restless".  I have been a light sleeper all my life but that doesn't mean I only get 3 to 4 hours a night.  I am really not thrilled with this sleep function but you can't have everything I guess.  I am to busy to have to go into the app to log anything even what I eat which I use to try but the sleep function is important.  I usually doze when I read and pushing a button is not on my mind.Thanks
Im extra tired due to my foot infection i know sleep is the best action of combat against an infection but I have only just achieved a healthy sleep routine and pattern after months of hard work and i am concerned about messing it up. Any advice.

I think mechanesthesia is exactly right.  This "$99 pedometer" should be just fine at adding 2 or more sleep times in a day so that a total sleep time can be accurately calculated and shown on the dashboard.  As a matter of fact, IT SHOULD show an accurate tabulation of sleep throughout the day.  For it to do otherwise certainly does qualify as a major short coming of the technology.  I hope that Fitbit catches that short coming and corrects it because it is in error that only the longest sleep time is counted.  How useless.  It might as well not even track sleep and just allow for manual entry of sleep stat's.  Fitbit programmers take notice please.
Thanks. Doctor just said 'get up and do something when you can't sleep'... have tried lavender but find it vile and doesn't help!

I was wondering the same thing.  Thanks for asking this question.  🙂
Hey everyone,  I've got a pretty good dilemma for your consideration:  Before I got serious about exercising I'd wake up in the middle of the night for at least 2 hours straight, which I'd spend anxiously surfing the web. Best I can tell (before fitbit) I probably got about 4-5 hours of sleep half the time, 6 hours on a good night.   Getting up early to exercise has enabled me to stay in bed and remain screen-free overnight; I get back to sleep easier when I wake up in the middle of the night. After I committed to this routine I got my Fitbit and now I know I more routinely get 6 hours of sleep with about an hour of wake time scattered over the course of the night (which Fitbit says is normal for men my age). Clearly an improvement.  So I'm looking to improve to an average of about 6.5 hours of sleep per night, and then increase from there. But in order to exercise I have to get up at 5AM. Now that my wife has early work hours, she needs to get up at 4:50 AM, so I get up with her (we exercise together). On a normal night, I help my daughter to bed and she's asleep by about 9:30. If housework is done at that time I can get to bed and be asleep by, say 9:45.  Obviously, I'd love to have less awake time in the middle of the night, as that would get me some bonus sleep given my time constraints, but I don't have much control over that.  Working out after work is not really an option because I get out of the office at 5:30 and home by 6:20, meaning it's time to cook dinner. By the time we've eaten, cleaned up from dinner and given our food time to digest, it's close to bedtime.  On paper, you'd think I'd get more sleep if I gave up exercising in the morning and pushed the alarm clock back to 6AM to get ready for work, but the exercise is what's preventing full-blown insomnia. Do you think I accept my current routine as "as good as it gets?"   For those of you whose sleep time is constrained at bedtime and wake time, what has helped you make the most of what you have?
How do you calculate "sleep efficiency" percentage.  I thought it was the time asleep divided by the time in bed, but today I got this chart: How can this possibly be 91% sleep efficiency?
I seem to get a cardio reading while I'm asleep , why is that?
I have been experiencing the same issue for some time now on my Versa 2. So the problem has been out there for awhile. My husband also has the Versa 2 and his sleep tracking works without issue, always.  Unfortunately I've never contacted Fitbit about this issue and don't look forward to the same process you had to go through for replacement.  Anyway, thanks for sharing your issue!
My experience with fitbit started with a weight study, why not now for a sleep study? Tell me what is the goal and the procedure to be part of the study, please.
The same with my Charge.. how odd!!!@djarz wrote:My Flex is recording my wide awake bathroom trips as restless sleep. I get out of bed, walk 10 steps to bathroom, pee, and return. What gives?
I wondered about this, too.  I tried both the One and the Flex, and found they were roughly similar in their reporting times, but the Flex is so much easier to wear and keep on 24/7 that I returned the One and I'm sticking with the Flex.  Either way, the standard setting was definitely NOT reporting accurately for me.  I switched to sensitive and it's much, much more accurate. How do I know this?  I own a Dropcam (an extremely good, versatile device by the way), and have had it pointing at my bed for the past week.  It records movement "alerts" on its web-based timeline, as well a full real-time video, which I have been watching back each day.  The number of times my video camera shows me moving or awake is roughly similar to the sensitive setting on the Flex, so that is 100% proof, not just how I feel. That said, my sleep efficiency is around 70%.  I was shocked to see in the video how many times I actually moved or rolled around (clearly not "asleep").  Anywhere from 12-18 times, and this is while on 12.5mg Ambien CR and 1.5mg Xanax XR (not at the same time, just trying different things on different days per my doc's recommendation). So I have no idea what's going on with my body.  My room is very dark, cool, quiet and comfortable.  Neither my wife nor I snore (again, the Dropcam confirms all this).  What is wrong with me?  How can Ambien and Xanax not keep me asleep all night?  My problem is not falling asleep, it's staying asleep, especially once 3am rolls around, hence the CR/XR type prescription.  I am able to be in bed for 8-10 hours yet I am only getting around 6 hours of solid sleep.  A strong cup of coffee one a day in the morning is usually all it takes, and I don't feel too sleepy during the day, but still, I should be getting more sleep. I've tried all the over-the-counter stuff, too.  Nothing works.  Tried Lunesta and Sonata last month, as well.  It's like my body just ignores all medication.  I am not stressed or worrying about any consciously that I am aware of.  My therapist recommended the Fitbit so I could track all this stuff, and between that and the Dropcam, it's been very "eye opening" (pun intended).  So that's how I came to this site. Thanks for any advice or impressions.  Sorry if I've gone a bit off topic.  This is my first post.
@becckyp Many of us who lift and do other activities focus on calories burned a day instead of steps. If this doesn't meet your needs, I suggest walking a mile or two and dividing the number of steps by the number of calories burned. This gives you steps/calorie.  If you multiply this number by the number of calories you burn weight lifting, then you get an equivalent number of steps. Be careful you don't double count steps by logging steps. I don't know how to prevent this, but maybe someone else does.

Hi Colin, Not too sure what you are trying to say. I am more interested in how long one continuous sleep it without interruptions. As I say, the average person needs 90 minutes to get to REM, which is the most important part of sleep. I generally wake or get restless with 30 - 60 minutes, meaning I don't get a decent nights sleep for many weeks.  See a typical graph of my sleep.  I hasten to add, I am not normally in bed this long! Regards Chris
Hi @Chardy19 Thank you so much for sharing this information 😊
My guess is that your girlfriend wears the fitbit a little tighter than you. Fitbit suggest there are a few reasons it can go back to the old style of reporting: "WHY DON'T I SEE SLEEP STAGES TODAY?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your tracker from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your tracker higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your tracker to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your tracker’s battery is critically low."taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163/
what would constitute a "frequent" variation in oxygen overnight that might require medical advice?  Does this mean several times a night OR several times a week?  Should I be concerned if I have a single high variation 4 nights out of 7?

As someone with sleep apnea as well as arthritis, I want to warn everyone about neck position, pillows, and positional apnea. Positional apnea, also called "chin tucking" is what happens when your chin drops towards your chest -- exactly what you can have happen if you sleep on your back with lots of pillows. Think of this as putting a kink in your airway like a garden hose.I inadvertently did this experiment when I had put on my CPAP mask and was reading trying to get sleepy. I was propped up on my pillows to see the book, and dozed off. For comparison, this is what 7 minutes of relatively normal breathing while asleep looks like for me: This is the 7 minutes that I dozed off while propped up on the pillows:Adding up the times of those events, it's a little over half of the 7 minutes spent not breathing. Which is not good! (Yes, that AHI of 85.7 is a bit above the level of 5 which counts as sleep apnea.) Chin tucking is not just while you are on your back -- you can also do it on your side in a fetal position. (Babies in the womb "breathe" through the umbilical cord and mama's lungs, so they can hang out in the fetal position all nine months. But once you've got to breathe through your own windpipe, you can't do that!) I actually sleep in a soft cervical collar (which cost me $12 at the drug store.) It forces me to keep my chin up no matter what contortions I'm doing to try to get comfortable enough to sleep...
@fmciiTalking to people I feel it is common not to remember your dreams. So no need to worry. I seem to be rare being able to remember 3 dreams some nights. This week I had an interesting dream. My anxiety decided to kick in and make me worry about something, so I coped to the best of my abilities. I remember dreaming that I was calm/calming myself. It was still not the best night, but by far not the worst I have had due to anxiety. My calming mindset must have carried over into my sleep.

Karolien | The Netherlands
I've been in your situation for possibly a year, can't remember any dreams, etc. Until last April when I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and prescribed an automatic CPAP machine.  First week or 2 I would vividly remember 2-3 dreams every night, waking up briefly after each one and remembering details of them. (Oddly I've seen one of the "side effects" of CPAP is listed as Excessive Dreaming, such an odd way to put it) Since then (it's been 6 weeks or so), I remember maybe 1 dream a night, possibly b/c I'm not waking up after the dreams anymore.  I think that is the key.  My fitbit is brand new (bought a Charge 3 yesterday) so last night's my only reference, but it showed 3 separate sessions at times that look similar to what I recall during the early days of my CPAP therapy, when I would briefly wake up after a dream and glance at the clock.  So they're happening just I'm not waking up enough to remember them.
I have an Inspire 2 and paid for the premium service to better track my sleep.  I haven't changed my settings on my Fitbit nor anything else, just charged my Fitbit.  Today I realized that the sleep data for total number of hours slept has been inaccurate since Saturday night's data.  The correct times are showing for going to sleep and waking up but the time asleep is way off.  Each night has been 7-8 hours but shows 1hr 41mins to 3hrs 17mins, so not getting good information.
My fitbit is tracking the amount of sleep i get and the time awake and restless but there is no sleep score. Ive searched the community and reset the fitbit and logged in and out of the app. Ive also tried to change where it lays on my wrist/arm and even changed arms. Still no score. I have not seen a solution on the forum even tho it looks to be a common topic.  thanks!  JT
If you suffer from interrupted sleep, there are lifestyle changes you can implement to try and sustain sleep for longer periods of time.
First, try restricting your sleep a little bit. Figure out how many hours you’re actually getting per night, minus any periods of wakefulness, and only allow yourself to be in bed for that long. After cutting down on your sleep, you’ll naturally become sleepier at night, leading you to sleep more deeply. 
Next, if you find yourself awake at night for more than fifteen minutes, get out of bed. Go to a quiet, dimly lit couch or comfortable chair, and do a relaxing activity like reading, meditating, or gentle stretching. Once you feel drowsy again, head back to bed. 
Finally, stick to your normal wake up time, even if you had a bad night of sleep the night before. Staying consistent with a bedtime and wake up time will help your body remain in tune with its circadian rhythm, and help your chances of resting peacefully through the night. *(best comments I've read)

Now that the weather has turned - going home to rake and work in the yard is a stress buster.  After one hour of productive yard work and also being outdoors to enjoy the weather - I rid myself of any stressful issues which may have consumed my day.
that happens to me when it presses against something.  i wear it at my waist so it happens a few times a week.  like another poster said, for some reason this does not often track on the site.  my regular sleep will but not when its done in error.  odd.is it possible that it is being pressed on something that could make it start.  i know that sometimes just bending over will do it as it is sandwiched between my hip and my stomach.good luck.
You may be really interested in how Fitbit tracks sleep then, as it breaks down deep sleep and REM separately, as well as provides benchmarks. https://blog.fitbit.com/sleep-stages-and-sleep-insights-announcement/

I have 2 readings in the 7 nights I have used it ? Most other parameters are recorded every night
You can set alarms based on time, but not on a sleep event. I'm not sure about the API route, but there's a dedicated API forum here that you'd probably want to ask there. Is there anything else besides sleep that you want from a fitbit? Heart rate tracking is popular, and comparing the heart rate graph to the sleep chart sometimes yields interesting information. In that case, I'd probably go with the Alta HR.

Best decision we ever made. Separate rooms. It felt awkward at first but now we also sleep much better.
That's interesting!I know somebody else who listens to things like white noise.Have you ever tried ASMR - binaural videos?Here's one I know of: https://youtu.be/xppnzlkpLzgSome are like role play videos but some are noises and sounds.
Welcome to the forums, @Fredkowalk7! I agree with your statement about exercise.
If recommended sleep time is seven hours, does the unconscious 'awake' time tracked by FitBit count against that?  If I look at the benchmarks in the FitBit app, my awake time is within normal ranges; however, that means I would have to be in bed over eight hours to get seven hours of sleep.  Perhaps the recommended ranges take into account the intermittent awake times?
@t.parker Wow. So how many kilometers or miles did you do that 24 hours Yeah I have had it not break up my sleep as a separate log. I have an 8 month old and this past week I had to wake up a couple times in one sleep log. The Sense did get them as awake stages. though.
I think having a little is what causes mommy brain. But I do think there is an opposite effect with a monitor. I remember when my kids were babies, I would wait for the monitor to go off which would of course prevent any deep sleep. The monitor is designed to wake you from a deep sleep, but I think it also prevents a deep sleep for some parents. By the time my kids were 6 months old- that thing was back in the box. I could hear them just fine and they fell into the 80/20 rule for schedules.

It buzzes, then two lights slowly fade to nothing. To check if it's still in sleep mode, tap and see two dancing lights. In the morning, tap five times firmly and it buzzes and a single light shows when tapped. That light is to show the daily goal progress. Any tap when awake is to tell you your progress - one light for each 20% of your goal. When you sync the next time, it ought to log your sleep. click to read about sleep tracking This link is to the Flex area where you will find the manual and related articles - click

According to How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?Question: How does my Fitbit device automatically detect sleep?Answer:Wrist-based Fitbit devices and Google Pixel Watch automatically detect your sleep when you wear your device to bed. We recommend wearing your device in a snug wristband while sleeping; don’t wear your device in a clip or pendant accessory.When your body is completely at rest and you haven't moved for about an hour, your device records that you're asleep.Is that leading hour tacked on to your sleep time (or not included)?

Hello @Drumbob. It's great to see you participating in the community forums! 
 
Thank you very much for sharing your experience, the tips you've followed and for letting me know about other symptoms. I was investigating and I noticed that the CPAP machine is currently used to treat mild to moderate sleep apnea, but depending on the severity of sleep apnea, doctors may recommend BiPAP instead. But I think it depends on the patients, some may require high levels of CPAP pressure so they may feel more comportable using BiPAP. 
 
This is very interesting and I hope some other users can give us more inputs 😊

That’s a great idea!! Thank you!
@writergal28  Sorry that no one replied to your message sooner. If you track your sleep manually, you will get sleep patterns, not sleep stages.  Sleep must be auto-detected to get sleep stages. If your wrist doesn't move for one hour, your tracker uses that to signal you are asleep.  The sleep start time is the time that your wrist stopped moving -- you don't lose that hour. You need more than three hours of sleep to get sleep stages.  More information in this Help article.

How do you see the benchmark comparison? I haven't been able to compare my sleep stages because I can't figure out where benchmark comparison is?
Thanks. Somewhat suspected. However, I thought I had completely removed that function since I am over 70.
I am experiencing the same issue. I am using the Charge2 synched to an iPhone 7, and I was able to get the new look for Sunday and Monday of this week but not Tuesday or Today. When I go to sleep change, but it doesn't matter if I sleep longer, shorter, go to bed earlier it has no effect. I read somewhere that you have to change to your non dominant hand, and this still does not work. I really like the pretty colours and would like to know how much light and deep sleep I am getting. I hope that there is a fix soon.
My inspire is not tracking sleep either, tracked one night  and it's only two weeks old. I called customer support and got a big go around, saying I have to contact Kohl's where I bought it and if they wont help me they might. This really bothers me as I have owned a fitbit since they first came out and have been pleased with them, I am surprised at customer service like that. They said that is isn't the fitbit that doesn't work its the application - well that doesn't matter so much to me I bought an item that I expect to work as it says it works. Please everyone contact customer service if you have an inspire and it doesn't work tracking sleep, you didn't do anything wrong, the device isn't working properly

Fitbit says that a manualy added or edited sleep record, should not see sleep stages. Without sleep stages a score should not be seen.
I'm fourteen and I usually wake up around twelve times a night. A lot of those times, though, I don't remember coming into consciousness.
After observing the various graphs and plots which are generated by my Fitbit Surge, I must say, even without an uber cool brain scan, the sleep data provided looks to be pretty darn accurate.  True, the Surge has no way of identifying REM sleep, but beyond that, it is spot on when using it to determine sleep efficiency.  Consider the following (two shots from the same day): Heart rate plot (five minute average): Sleeping plot: To my eye at least, the periods of longest/deepest sleep correlate to the lowest heart rate while periods of restlessness (rolling over, getting up for a drink or to visit the bathroom...) map pretty nicely to small spikes in my heart rate.  Given I have pretty severe sleep apnea (controlled with a CPAP), the sleep tracking of my Surge is both an accurate and necessary tool for me.
you could just not wear the band.  i like all the other functions, but the sleep tracker seems a little gimmicky to me.  if i feel tired the next morning, i know i didn't sleep well.

My Fitbit is not calulating the sleep hours correctly. It set it at 10PM and sleep unit 5AM. It calulates that I only sleep 5 hours. Why?
Good afternoon Community!
 
You may have heard or read about our new sleep feature called "Sleep Schedule." Consistency is key when it comes to many good habits, and so getting on a consist sleep schedule is something that we hope will improve your sleep! Along with your sleep goal, you can now also set a bedtime goal and wake up goal, as well as get a reminder to start winding down a little bit before your bedtime goal time!
 
Here's a post from our blog about why getting consistent sleep is important. If you have questions about this feature, here's the relevant help article. 
 
Let the Community know how this feature has helped you get more sleep, or other things you've experienced when using this feature. We'd love to hear from you! Happy sleeping 🙂

Actually, people with narcolepsy may feel rested after waking, but then feel very sleepy throughout much of the day. Many individuals with narcolepsy also experience uneven and interrupted sleep that can involve waking up frequently during the night as you said and narcolepsy can greatly affect daily activities. I didn't know it has name. 🤔

I installed the Windows Phone app a little over a week ago (could be within a couple of days of release). I don't sync my Flex with my phone every day. I don't know when my last phone sync was. But for the last 5 days my sleep tracking log on the web site has been showing time in bed equal to time actually slept. I also notice that the Windows Phone app shows different numbers from what's on the web back when the web was providing me a different actual sleep time than time in bed. Anybody know why these are different and why the web quit calculating as expected?

I think, for lots of people things suddenly changed. For me, it's always Saturday. At least, it feels like that. Then, I wake up in the morning and it takes a while to snap back to reality and realize that it's time to "go" to work - to my makeshift "office" in the living room. This affects my sleep a lot, too. It's half past midnight when I write this post and yet, I don't even feel sleepy. I would say, it's just something to get used to and adjust because it may have to last for couple more weeks.
I would like to see what your pattern looks like.  But there is no attachment.I have no one to compare their sleep pattern to mine.So I can't judge how good or bad mine is.
Very interesting discussion.  Have had a Fitbit Charger HR for 3 weeks now and find and restless between 20 and 30 times most nights with the time anything up to an hour.  Never get more than about an hour's uninterrupted sleep.2 years ago suddenly realised my memory had gone AWOL - basically just couldn't access sections of it even when people tried to jog it as we all do naturally in conversation when some-one says they can't remember that meeting or that match or whatever.  Still believe it was due to poor sleep - had jetlag for several weeks after spending December and January in Texas (over 10 hours sunshine nearlt every day) and returning to UK, max 8 hours, rarely sunshine.have read you need at least 1.5 hours before get stage 3 sleep which is when the brain sorts out your memories.Richard
Hello community.  I go to bed around 10 pm and get up around 7.  I know I am a terrible sleeper but many nights my fitbit either doesn't record any sleep at all or less than 1 hour.    It often only shows sleep from about 4 am.  If I get up to use the bathroom does it wipe out all my data?  This has been happening forever.  I upgraded to premium thinking the data would help my doctor but I think the data is completely inaccurate.  This also seems to prevent calculating a readiness score.   Here is an example.
Hi there,What fit bit app are you using?
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but for some reason my Fitbit Versa is not recording my sleep, it’s just recording a few hours of each night and it’s random times each night...is there a way to fix this
Interesting question. I had the same question and found this article in Time magazine to be a good read. http://time.com/3183183/best-time-to-sleep/

I was just getting ready to post the same concern. Started with a new Versa 2 yesterday and this morning it cut off my sleep at 5:30am when I got up and went to the restroom.  I hope there's an easy fix.
Just bought a Versa, have used it for a week now but it isn't tracking my sleep, only for a few hours a night. I haven't had any trouble with any previous Fitbit. Has anyone else had this problem and know how to fix it? Thank you.
Even more interesting is the domain name isn't even a month old and is located in the Ukraine, not the UK.

Thanks for all the input, I will be making an appointment with my PC soon and will show these to him as well. I wake up feeling extremely tired and sometimes wake myself briefly gasping for air. My husband also has noticed that I go for long spans of time without breathing which has alarmed him also. I don't have tattoos and I believe I am wearing it in the suggested area with a comfortably snug fit.Thanks again, Sherri
I like a cool bedroom, too, @WilsonFitbit  but have found it helps to keep the problem joints warm. I often wear a wool knee brace to bed and sometimes wear gloves to keep my hands toasty warm. I’ve also found that the lighter the blankets, the easier it is to move around.
I found this Fitbit that gives some information on this: "Sleep stages are traditionally measured in a lab using an electroencephalogram to detect brain activity along with other systems to monitor eye and muscle activity. While this method is the gold standard for measuring sleep stages (source), your device can estimate your sleep stages in a more comfortable, convenient way. Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep. While you’re sleeping, your device tracks the beat-to-beat changes in your heart rate, known as heart rate variability (HRV), which fluctuate as you transition between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages. When you sync your device in the morning, we use your movement and heart rate patterns to estimate your sleep cycles from the previous night." Taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htm
Thanks! Did that and I like the results better/more accurate.
No, NugsMom. No answers at all from fitbit. I just keep getting asked the same questions that I have already answered here in the discussion and in private messages. I give up. It is frustrating and like nothing but the current reply is looked at or remembered..
Hi I'm in my 50s and only seem to get around 5 - 6 hrs sleep a night and only 11 - 13% showed as deep sleep but I had to get a new Fitbit charge 2 and now I appear to have no deep sleep at all! I'm not convinced it's really all that accurate so I wouldn't worry to much. If you feel fine when you wake up that's the main thing 👍
I use Sleep by Android. It acts as a smart alarm but also gives you a read out of how much time you spent in light sleep, deep sleep and REM. Another thing I like about it is that it wakes me up to my Spotify play list not a jarring noise and has a lullaby function. Basically white noise to help you drift off. I prefer 'thunderstorms'
So, I was just wondering if anyone else has this issue. I find that with the Charge 2, and the heart-rate related auto-sleep, that I'm told I take 0 minutes to fall asleep. After I've been laying in bed for 40 minutes. I was just wondering if there was a way to still get the heart rate, detailed sleep report, but also be able to have it account for the fact that I'm wide awake for sometimes an hour before I fall asleep.

Hi guys. I’ve had my Versa 2 for almost 2 months now and I got quite addicted to checking my sleeping stages and heart rate and I noticed something that worries me a little bit. Since I first got it, every single night my heart rate increases a lot (first thing after falling asleep) very suddenly and drastically keeps going up and up, forming this kind of a “hill” and then usually after half hour-one hour it starts dropping back down. My oxygen level during night is always perfect, I do not snore, and no matter what - whether I had a drink before or whether I was completely relaxed before going to sleep, it happens every single night. Does anybody experienced the same thing or have any idea why it could be?
Hi, when I was using my fitbit charge 2 to track my sleep I got results in a sleep pattern (awake, restless, asleep). about a week ago, my girlfriend wore my fitbit, and it recorded her sleep at stages (awake, rem, light, deep).Strangely, when I wore it again yesterday during the night myself, it recorded it as a sleep pattern again...Why is this happening? Any ideas how I can get it track my sleep in stages?
I'm ambidextrous; ordinarily I use one hand for some things; the other for others.  Therefore, I can't "wear on non-dominant hand".  1. Will Fitbit record hand movement on both sides?2. What is the threshold for movement?  If I walk carrying something in the hand with the Fitbit and do not therefore move that arm while walking (my dog's leash, for example), does that mean the steps are not recorded?   3. My work is largely done on a computer 5 days/week.  Those hours should have a BMR-level of "step equivalents" recorded -- I get that -- but not actual steps.  Does even hand movement (typing, moving a mouse, etc.) rack up steps?  I hope not!
Please let them listen to us by leaving a 1-star review on App Store, Amazon and all other stores. They couldn't care less about what we say (people, whose money they already pocketed), but once there is a risk that it will influence the purchasing decisions of potential buyers, they will have to pay attention. They have been ignoring users' complaints regarding this forced sleep score for two months already (some unlucky people received this update much earlier than us) and they will continue doing this, if we don't speak out in the most effective way. They successfully ignored community feedback regarding the new dashboard. And they are successfully doing the same with every other complaint or suggestion.
Mine is doing the exact same thing? Have you managed to get anything sorted with yours?

I want to than FitBit for including a way to enter steps on days when I forgot it and let it sleep. Yesterday I danced for two hours, about 10,000 steps and would have lost them if it were not for this new aability to enter data. thank you
I don't know what model of Fitbit you have, but when mine only registered 4 hours of sleep.....and I knew I had slept more.....I rebooted it and it was fine.  If it is set on sensitive, that may also be a problem.  Mine had to be set to normal when I first got it for the same reason....it showed WAY too much restlessness and not enough hours of sleep.  Check that first.....be sure it's on normal.  Thanks for your post.
I’m not sure if the link has already been posted here, but I just got pointed to this blog post by Fitbit from June 2016: How Do Your Sleep Habits Stack Up? It came up in my mobile app today as a "sleep insight". Just in case you don’t know how to get these things, here is the relevant setting in the app:  If/when enabled, you will get "insights" personalized to your sleep stats. Here is the one I got today:   Great feature IMO!

Hello @edwardmorris, let me give you a warm welcome to the community forums! 
 
What an interesting topic! This caught my attention and I was surprised to know that Poor Sleep makes back pain worse and that the back pain can also keep us awake during the night. 😮 Fortunately; there are also some tips that could help to relieve back pain when we're on bed: 
 
1. Lay flat on our back.2. Place a pillow underneath our knees and keep your spine neutral. 3. We may also place a small, rolled up towel under the small of our back for added support.
 
Have a great day!

@SleepInsights, @belindaesq, According to this thread, it looks like the problem may have been solved!

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
No I do not. Sometimes, I charge my fitbit over night, so thats obvious. Sometimes, it plain bothers me to wear it at night and I take it off sometime during the night. Right now I am trying to be more constant to figure out my sleep patterns after having a drink in the evening.
I can sort of relate to your situation. I have multiple chronic illnesses, most of which highly affect my sleep quality (Fibro, Chronic Fatigue, EDS). I got a sleep study done a few years ago because I was having problems falling asleep at random. It became so severe that I was falling asleep while driving. The sleep study was covered by my insurance. During the 8 hour study, they found that I never went into a deep sleep and moved over 800 times during the night. They kept me the next day for further study. They had me lay down for a nap every hour and a half to see if I could fall asleep and how quickly. I fell asleep every time. They ended up diagnosing it as "hypersomnolence" which to me is the same as CFS.I took sleeping pills for many years but the last year I have weaned myself off and now only take melatonin. I think I slept better on the sleeping pills but I hate to be dependant on them. When I do feel decent when I wake up, its usually the nights that I dont play on my phone before bed. Knitting and reading help wind me down. Still working on getting better sleep...and better health for that matter! Any suggestions are welcome ❤️
I would say a combination of things mentioned here works for me:- a good book- going to bed/waking up at the same time- no caffeine in the afternoon
@Mytwocentsworth I've moved your post to this thread. I'm not sure about which results you should take to the doctor. Well, you can export your sleep data with everything that it has and take it to the doctor or go with them first and ask which data they want.  To download sleep data > Go to your Dashboard > click on settings > Data Export and choose sleep data.  Hope this helps

So basically, if I’m awake in bed, my Fitbit will just assume I’m asleep. I usually get 7-8 hours of good sleep, so I’m not really worried about it too much, but last night I was awake from 10pm to midnight, and in my sleep log it says I was was asleep during that whole time period. This on top of the inaccurate heart rate readings during exercise, is really making me wonder what the point of this device is. It seems that it is inaccurate on all fronts other than resting heart rate for me.

I have my sleep on normal and automatic.  Last night, I woke up at 1:00 AM and looked at my fitbit.  It already said I woke at 6:38AM!!  how is that when it was only 1:00AM??  I figured I'd wait till the morning, I slept till 8:30 AM and the fitbit still had me up at 6:38 AM..  why is it so inaccurate??
Very interesting. I've been trying to figure out my poor sleep issues.How long and how consistent has this been for you?
Quoting from sleep help:It’s normal to see awake minutes in your sleep stages; studies have shown a typical adult could wake up briefly between 10-30 times per night (source). You may not remember waking up since you likely fell right back to sleep, especially if you were awake for less than 2-3 minutes at a time. If you wake up in the morning feeling like you had a restless night, you may notice more awake minutes in your sleep stages as compared to other nights.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
@SleepyOtago What do you mean by "turned on the heart monitor"? I have a Sense and don't make any heart monitor adjustments. It's always on and I'm not aware of an option to turn it off.
I'd like to get a better understanding of what the normal/typical range is for:Heart Rate Variability;Sleeping heart rate range for percentage above and below resting heart rate;Percentage of tossing and turning;High and low limits for estimated oxygen variation.If age is a factor, I am a 75-year old male but also interested in other age ranges. Thank you for any comments/clarifications you can provide.
As a guy from the IT field, it should be relatively easy to setup the auto sleep function, without any additional sensors. It could just require some more input from the end user. With better sleep habits, we should all strive to get to bed at approximately the same time. WIth the end user adding the normal sleep habit window in as an additional input...this could be combined with the activity state, and used as a layered condition...to determine if the user is asleep.
@Stephjboyd that was an interesting read - so did they figure out if they can easily resolve this or is it going to be more timely?? I notice that the actions to help ease it on the NHS website are the same as easing a multitude of ailments which including stopping smoking, not drinking alcohol and caffeine in the evenings and regular exercise,  (that covers 90% of issues of the body nowadays) apparently they check for iron deficiency as well and supplements can help, my issue is weight I know that - I think I wake myself from snoring although my ex said I didn't snore bad so I am thinking did I have the same as you and she left cos I kept kicking her 🙂 . hope there is something they can do - I know what a drag it is if you don't get a decent regular sleep pattern - I have managed to et mine from approx. 4 hrs to between 5-6 hours so far so I will give them credit exercise does help in that instance. good luck and hope its not too disruptive on your sleep Kind Regards Wayne

Or it could be Fitbit average heartbeat rate while I go to the kitchen to get a glass of water with heartbeat rate when I am actually sleeping. I find this particular metric totally unreliable. Disappointingly unreliable
Having a completely sleepless night without stimuli (be it strong caffeine or having lights or noise all night long) is not normal at all. If this is a one off then I guess it can happen but if it start to happen multiple times you should consult a doctor.
I went in the Dashboard Tapped Edit in top left corner. Scroll all the way to the bottom and found sleep without a tick in the left hand circle.  Syncing somehow switched it off.  Ticked the circle and my sleep data is back.  Weird!!
I cant find how to change my sleep sensitivie?

This seems to be pervasive and current.  My wife's Charge 3 is missing data from Sat (26th) & Sun(27th).
Per Steve's link above, the formula for sleep efficiency is:
 
time asleep / (total time in bed - time to fall asleep)
 
This is simply the amount of time you were asleep (and not restless) divided by the time you spent in bed after initially falling asleep.
I just realized Fitbit One has 2 selections for sleep tracker: Normal and Sensitivity and I just change my setting from Normal to Sensitivity for better and accurate results.

Typically, level should be 95-100% to be considered good.It's difficult to tell the percentage in the graph since it just says "high" and "low", but according to fitbit, "Seeing high variations is a clue that you may be experiencing breathing disturbances during sleep.so, I guess you're good!
I regularly get sleep scores of 90 and 91. I have FitBit premium and the score is calculated as such:  Time Asleep counts for 50 points, Deep+REM count for 25 points, and sleeping heart rate counts for 25. I scored a 91 when I was asleep for 8:45 (46/50 points), received 2 hours of Deep+2 hours of Rem (23/25 points), had my sleeping heart rate at 87% below my resting heart rate (22/25 points). Improvements in each of these 3 categories would get you to a score of 100. Same question as I asked Austin...How were you able to lower your sleeping HR. My RHR is lower by 10 but there’s no change in sleeping HR. Please see my reply to Austin for more details. Any ideas are welcome! I’d love your input since it sounds like you’ve found the sweet spot! btw I’m not looking at this as a game to be won. I’d just like to figure out how to get less REM and how to lower my sleeping HR. I do well in the amount of time asleep and all other areas, it’s just my sleeping HR is high and my REM tends to be higher than average. I rarely go to bed and wake at different times. I may sleep an extra hour on Saturday mornings every few weeks but that’s only 1-2x a month max. I did forget to add that I’m currently a 43yrs female with over 10,000 steps a day. I consider myself moderately active by walking and doing resistance training 3-5x a week. I’m unable to run or jog but try to do spurts of speed walking while in my daily walks. Those are not as I’d like but better than it used to be. Still working on increasing the duration of spurts to work my heart a little more. Never expect it to be on high end for long due to pain issues stopping me from any jarring exercise but do want to spend more time in the middle area while exercising. Thanks for your comment as well, you both have given me hope that better sleep is possible!
It wakes me up, but I am not the deepest of sleepers. To makes sure it WOULD wake me up, I set the fitbit alarm 10 minutes EARLIER than my regular alarm -- just in case.@bi1 wrote:can get to buzz to wake you up
Everyone is different and not everyone is a heavy sleeper. I will wake up most of the time if I hear a noise, but I also get up at night to put more wood into the stove, get a drink ,etc.

I have only had my fitbit 3 nights.  The first night I did not sleep much at all and I ripped that thing off me.  The next night I made it until 4:30 a.m. wearing it.  The third night I made it until 7 a.m. and deactivated it and slept 2 more hours.  Last night it showed that I woke up 15 times. That seems about right for tossing and turning over.
I am with you Jeanahugg love the name 🙂 very rarely get 7 hours sleep the fit bit record was some what of a shock at how little of sleep I survive on. thanks for sharing
You can in fact get the weekly average of time asleep also from the app: select "Sleep", swipe on the graph ("sleep score") to the left until you reach the last (4th) graph ("Hours in Sleep Stages"). Then tap on that graph to maximize it. You will see average time asleep for the ongoing week. Swipe to the right to browse through previous weeks.

The sleep function is simply monitoring your movement during the night.  Moving around during the night is equated with being restless and awake and not in a deep sleep.  To get your heartrate you would need a band - ideally a chest band - that measures your pulse.   To get that kind of capability requires a lot more battery power, so you'd endup needing to wear a bulky watch sized device.  The devices available with this capability are a lot more expensive, and they rely on a wrist heart monitor.  These require the strap to be tighter than most people wear a regular watch, plus the reading is prone to error due to movement, moisture, etc.  To add bp you would also need to wear some kind of cuff.   All in all it would be uncomfortable and probably not that useful given the innacuracy in the readings.  Perhaps in years to come all of this stuff can be miniturized, but not in the short term.
@neba47  The benchmark %'s are only available on the phone app, not on the fitbit.com (web) dashboard.  From the phone app dashboard, tap on the sleep tile, then on any given day.  There is a toggle above the bar graphs that shows the time spent in the different sleep stages.  You can go between "Today", "30 Day Avg" and "Benchmark".  In my case, it says "Ranges for women your age", but does not list an age range.

As a pastor in a small town I'm often going for long hours, and dealing with serious issues. Years ago I went to Chico, stayed in a motel, took a shower and slept for about 14-15 hours straight. I didn't realize how exhausted, physically, mentally and spirituall I was. I now get away about every three months and just go to a place to vege out and sleep.
I suspect that checking my sleep patterns from the previous night has an effect on how well-rested I feel that day. If the chart reports little deep sleep, I am really feeling it the next day. Or am I? Check out this blog post Placebo Sleep, which discusses how sleep and HRV data can skew our perceptions about how we feel and our performance.  I've been quite guilty of taking all the data in without checking in with my body for verification of how I REALLY am doing. Because of this, I wait an extra day or two before checking the sleep logs. Am I the only one who gets a little worked up over REM and deep sleep?

Thank you for this, I am going to try again with the fitbit on tighter as I did loosen it at night too. I do tend to sleep with my arms high too so this does seem a plausible explanation .SaleghSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
Topic about fit bit tracker generating EMF radiation and effecting sleep Hi all, I recently searched that EMF radiation like objects that use wifi such as iPhone and laptops can actually caused disturbed sleep, that EMF radiation can disturb sleep, I recently tried putting devices such as laptop or phones into aeroplane mode when sleeping (or switching them off) in my bedroom and thought it has improved my sleep. I realised that although my inspire fit bit - (when my phone is switched off or on aeroplane mode) it will still use Bluetooth right (which still uses EMF). I think that the EMF from this fit bit I have would probably be less (right) is there a way of working out the amount of EMF radiation an inspire two I have produced? Does anyone know on average how much EMF fit bits will produce? (I imagine it would be a lesser amount compare to other devices) Thanks. I was thinking of maybe taking fit bit off my wrist when I go to sleep or leaving it in another room when trying to go to sleep.
Same issue, I want to see sleep on the watch, at least time, so I know if I'm sleeping or not. Fitbit replaced another band that did this, but the app stopped working, so here I am.. Thanks.
In addition to indicating restlessness and duration, perhaps tracking sleep is also relevant to Fitbit's calculation of resting pulse (partly reflecting pulse around waking time, but not that simple I gather)? Does it make much difference to that if you don't wear it at night? I don't find it a hassle and as commented by others, I think the pulse pattern data over night also point to overall fitness/wellness/comfort.
Hi everyone! It's good to see you here.
 
Thanks for taking the time to share your experience with our Fitbit devices. Let me explain that when your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your device records that you’re asleep. If your device tracks heart rate and you slept for more than 3 hours, you'll see sleep stages recorded. 
 
Take in mind that if your device detects excessive movement, your device will either record time spent awake or stop tracking your sleep. To learn more about how our Fitbit devices track sleep data, please see this help article.
 
To prevent any misunderstanding or confusion, I'm going to close this thread from further comments. Your feedback is appreciated and we'll keep working to improve our products and features to make Fitbit more useful for you.

No. You don't think we get as much sleep as we think. Make sure your settings are in the least sensitive setting. One night I had to take Benadryl and I slept so well according to Fitbit. No waking and no restless moments. Pretty funny.

I'm a rehabilitation and clinical psychologist working at a large medical clinic in Ontario where all my patients are referred by one of 30 physicians or 6 nurse practitioners. Any health care provider who does not listen to and learn from their patients is to be avoided! The total hours slept reported by the fitbit are valuable data for a health care provider, especially as it is accepted lore in the medical community that people with insomnia most often greatly under-estimate the amount of sleep they get, making self-report unreliable (I don't agree with this). Physicians are trained early to report subjective "symptoms" (reported by the patient) and separately objective "signs" (where there is external evidence). Looking at my own data, I find the total hours slept to be the most helpful sleep data. I tend to push myself too hard and pay for it. The fitbit gives me hard data about self-care that is essential to my work and health. Sleep disturbance is very important, as it is correlated with suicide; mood; thought content; cognitive funcitoning; psychomotor function and safety; and heart health, just to name a few functions. I have no idea what the restlessness indicators actually signify, but it is interesting to look at that data as well. If a patient brought me a fitbit report that indicated a consistent lack of sleep, I would place it in the chart, especially if it were from a Charge or above (which track sleep automatically and are thus more reliable). We have discussed purchasing several trackers to send home on our patients to monitor their activity level (our mandate is health maintenance and prevention). These things are more than toys. They can be useful motivational tools, and they provide relevant and reliable data that is helpful to track a variety of modifiable lifestyle factors--which are increasingly recognized as the vanguard of medicine. I have no doubt we are seeing just the beginning of their use. I use biofeedback for some folks, and adding a heart rate variability function to the fitbit may be one of the next features we see. HRV is useful for addressing anxiety, the most common mental health problem. Galvanic skin response might be another option as this is correlated with anxiety as well. An enterprising student invented a sensor to place in shoes, which is able to detect changes of gait that signify an increased risk of falling in the elderly (falls are a main precipitant to death in the elderly). There is no end of possibilities to do useful and clever new things with this technology. Just last week, a patient of mine worried aobut his father with Alzheimer's who is just beginning to wander but not yet ready for a nursing home. We discussed putting a GPS enabled tracker on him as one possible safeguard. Yes, this technology has real uses and the physician who laughed demonstrated their ignorance, rather than an inadequacy of the data.
Hi! Trying to understand my sleep efficiency. What should I be aiming for? I rarely come in higher than 50%. I mostly get 7-8 hours of "sleep" with more than half of that registering as "restless". Any thoughts?
Fresh air is brilliant for aiding In a good nights sleep, nice warm shower/bath some lavender, you'll be having sweet dreams in no time. 😄Sent from my iPad
I'm a lefty but I sit at a computer all day and my right hand and arm have a lot movement. I find it to be very floppy when I walk too. I was hoping to get clarity because I have the Charge HR and resting heart rate may be different for dominant and non dominant wrists......anyone anyone but i'll keep checking the boards.
It means you are tossing and turning in your sleep. The fitbit tracks movement, so anytime you move during hte sleep mode, it registers you as being restless. If there's too much movement, it registers you as being awake.  I haven't paid the yearly fee - I don't think I need that much extra data. What I've got is enough.
I think that is because some people sleep more than once per day. No way to modify that I am aware of.

I would!  I know I have trouble sleeping but didn't think anything of it until I changed my sleep mode to sensitive... Is this what your sleep patter looks like?
Do you have a Charge 2? For the Charge 2 they are still rolling the update out to everyone (I am waiting too).

If you are talking about on the semicircle graph to the right of heart rate, the gray area is when you were awake, apparently from 5:45 AM until 1:35 PM.  It is showing two sleeps periods and the awake time in between.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Great idea! Thank you!
maybe you are worried about something at work / school? The guys that wrote earlier are right, you should see a doctor. and another question. despite the indicators, are you fast asleep? do you feel good in the morning? because of course fitbit is good, but not ideal in measurements))
I noticed it started happening a few of days ago.Go to the log / sleep area, click on EDIT, (like you were going to adjust the start/end time) and without changing anything click on "update".  It will re-calculate the sleep efficiency.

My new fitbit flex is vibrating once or twice and waking me up every night so far (had it three nights now). I don't have a silent alarm set, I can only assume this is a little jolt to get me moving due to inactivity? I have the fitbit set to "sleep" and it is tracking my sleep during these times, so why would I be getting little wake ups from during the night? Pretty frustrating, has anyone else experienced this? I never get "nudges" like that during the day.

Ok, just in case anyone else is as confused as I was: On my iPhone, I went to the AppStore and there was no update for the Fitbit app. (And wasn't any of the times that I looked over the last few days.)To find the update, first I searched on "Fitbit" in the AppStore search function. This listed the Fitbit app, and it had an "OPEN" button, exactly like you expect when it's an app that's already on the phone. Then I clicked on the app in the search results -- this shows more detail about the application. At THAT POINT -- where I would expect to see the "OPEN" button there was an "UPDATE" button! I clicked it, the familiar circle status started filling. Once that completed, it is an "OPEN" button, and when I Open the app the heart rate graphs are now back the way that they should be.(The user interface to access these graphs still sucks, but at least they are there!)
It is possible to edit your sleep log on the dashboard. I use a laptop for this, not the app. On your dashboard, go to the top of the page where it says 'log' select sleep and scroll down to where you see the graph of your sleep. Hover on the graph and on the right hand side of that square there will be a gray paper/pen icon indicating you can edit the log. Click and edit as you like. Fitbit will adjust all your data accordingly.
My sleep tracker is showing me that I am waking up many times. What's normal?
Any idea how we get Fitbit to fix this problem?
Are you sure you're getting it into and out of sleep mode correctly?  For the Flex, tap it twice to wake it up.  You should see the lights light up in sequence, then stop with one or more lit which shows your goal progress.  Immediately after the lights go out, tap it again several times (don't count, but around 5 it should switch modes). After the lights go out, confirm it's in sleep mode by tapping it once or twice again and you should see two lights come on and dance. See the help articles under settings-help about help mode.  https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/176101-how-do-i-track-my-sleep- .  To switch back from sleep to normal, again tap twice to wake it up (two lights dance).  Immediately tap rapidly 5-6 times until all of the lights light up.  When the lights go out confirm the mode changed by tapping twice again and you should see the lights light up in progression again showing your goal progress.
I've always been a tired person and my sleep has changed over the years. Right now, I don't have any trouble falling asleep but I wake up exhausted and can't stay awake, even with coffee and Rx stimulants. I would nap all day if I could. Lots of people talk about sleep hygeine but I don't really have trouble falling asleep. Will it help me sleep deeper? I go to bed at a pretty consistent time (10 PM), I've tried to wake up consistently at 7 AM like I have to do most days for school but on days I don't leave for school I fall right back asleep on the couch. If I'm at school, I often just fall asleep in class instead.here is a typical night on normal mode:  (The thick bar at 7 am is to let my dog out, the others I definitely didn't get out of bed)And a typical night on sensitive mode.Any recommendations on how to sleep deeper?
To begin sleep, tap two fingers constantly until you see only two dots on the display. (.     .) To end sleep, tap two fingers constantly until you see five dots on the display. ( . . . . . )
My replacement Charge 2 (version 22.53.04) properly records BPM but will not record sleep or sleep stages.  I‘m using the Fitbit ios App with an iPhone.  To try resolve the issue I have performed the following procedures:
 

Restarted watch multiple times
Synced Fitbit with App multiple times
Logged out and logged back into my account
Changed BPM setting from Auto to On, to off and back to Auto
Logged out of App
Forced quit the App.
Restarted iPhone

The only thing I can think of is that you have a spike in adrenaline, endorphins and dopamine which is all normal during exercise and what leads to the "feel good" sensation after. Here is an article that can answer other questions you may have about brain activity during exercise. If none of this helps,  a reach out to your GP is in order.

I called them and they said that we are not seeing the times when we click on the sleep data because they are in the process of changing the app to show more details (light sleep, deep sleep, REM sleep etc.).  I asked when that change would be available (I did see something on my phone app today referring to the new sleep thing) and they said soon but couldn't give me a specific day.  It is coming though and I think we'll be much happier with it.  I had Jawbone Up last year which I wasn't too crazy about in general but it did give more sleep info so I'm looking forward to this update.

Maybe you should reduce the amount you drink in the evening, so as not to have to wake up too many times during the night.

Thanks, perhaps I will just see if I can have a sleep study done. I do not snore so I would hope it do not have sleep apnea, I have however woken up breathless a few times so  this could be the case. Thank you for the response.
Hey there @ShayneD38 welcome to the Community!  I believe you have a great idea, I would also prefer to have a smart alarm to wake me up at the end of a sleep cycle 😉 your suggestion can get more attention from our product development team and more users if you share it in our Ideas Board it that way you can get more votes.

I've had my Pixel watch since Christmas and I've tried everything... Resetting, wearing it tighter, wearing it looser, cleaning the watch and my wrist really well, setting sleep detection to sensitive... Still, at least once a week it "doesn't get a consistent heart rate" which doesn't make sense because the watch itself has no issues tracking HR. Any suggestions?
I am technically ambi-dextrous ---- they tried to make me write with right hand but failed once my parents realized I wouldn't change and they stepped in at school and made sure mean teacher did not hit me every time I used my left hand to print.  I wear my watch on my left wrist and my fitbit on my right wrist.  I've set fitbit sensitivity for "dominant" and "normal" --- it seems to be working more accurately than it did on previous settings (before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and began using CPAP machine to keep me breathing while I slept).  It's really a matter of trial and error for lefties and ambi's. Good luck.
Sleep score disappearedon charge 3
Sleep tracker does not log accurate times.  I don't use it manually, next morning, start time in bed in nearly 2 hours later than actual time.Any thoughts from anyone? Thanks
Hi, not sure if this has to do with the new OS update, but today my sleep report is just not doing anything. It worked yesterday. It won't work when I plug into my computer and try and update online either. I wore it all night the way I always do, and cannot get it to update. I tried all the troubleshooting that the website recommends. Anyone else have this issue? Or any fixes?  Thanks.
Thank You for your post Mountain High. The contention that fitbit screwed up many devices with their effort to pull back sleep diagnostics is true.
This morning I woke up to find that I had removed my watch when I was asleep. Kind of like sleep walking.  I don't remember taking it off. I had a silent alarm set and when my back up alarm went off I went to tap the watch and noticed I had taken it off and it was on floor next to my bed ><. Wondering if anyone had a similar experience and possibly some suggestions. Charge HR so I defiantly had to undo the watchband clasp..
Thanks!  How do I sync again?  Do I unplug the dongle and plug it back in, or is there a better way?
Awesome it's fixed @kar1981 Removing posts isn't possible. Wishing a wonderful day
I would try to change your sleep settings to “sensitive” instead of the normal default, changing that will change the sleep detection on your watch and should pick up your awake times.To do so you will go to your settings the into “advanced settings” then down the to “sleep sensitivity”
So I ended up getting the issue resolved! The gal I spoke to on chat at fitbit.com had me do a reset on my Fitbit Charge 2 while on the charger and she on my account. So far it seems to have worked! I got a sleep score last night and supper happy about that! I think they made some changes to the sleep portion of the app and for some reason even when update was done to app it did not update the actual watch. But once the reset was done while on charger, she and I seem to get things working. Hope this helps everyone. 🙂
I contacted Fitbit support and they offered the following recommendation:  Since that you still unable to receive your sleep log as for your last sync, we recommend that you follow these steps:Manually sync your device by following the steps in How do I manually sync my tracker or watch?Restart your device following the steps in How do I restart my Fitbit device?Try sleeping with your device on your non-dominant hand. We'd like you to observe your sleep again to check if the issue still persist. I followed these suggestions and nothing brought back the lost data.  The following night my data was captured.  Good Luck!
The algorithm almost certainly is only tracking time in bed. I sleep cycle disorder meaning I don’t cycle through stages and I wake up 7 to 8 times per night for no reason just to go back to sleep. It tells me I got great sleep because I got 45 minutes of deep sleep at the beginning of the night, 80 REM at the end, and a total “time asleep” of eight hours. Didn’t complete a single REM cycle, feel like crap, and could sleep another 3-4 in the morning. It is a very basic algorithm, it has to be.
Nice input, @alexthecat. 
 
Great practice! I think I'll be trying this as well and I'm sure that this, along with meditation will be doing a great combination. 😊 Thanks for sharing!
 
Have a wonderful day!

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Hi everyone! I've been using Fitbit Charge 2 for several months now, and I've noticed that my sleeping patterns are quite strange most of the nights. I read a few books about sleep and circadian rhythms, so I know what the normal sleep should look like. However, what I get is not it. Here is the example from today:As you can tell, all my deep sleep phase was very fragmented, and if you look closely, nearly every one of them was followed by short awakings, after which I would get back to light sleep. Of course, I woke up feeling not so great, and this happens quite frequently. I'm beginning to think that I have sleep apnea. Can anyone please share their thoughts on this? Should I see a doctor and have it checked? Thank you!
Hi @Ragalina1 Do you get a heart rate during the day?

Maybe it's time to work with a sleep specialist.  You may have an undiagnosed sleep disorder. There are many kinds of sleep disorders. Right now the "headliner" condition is sleep apnea, but there are many others that could be affecting -- and afflicting -- your nights. Another possibility:  you could have subtle nutrient deficiencies. For some people, even a small deficiency can have outsize effects and consequences.  Conventional doctors are not helpful should this be the case; look for a good naturopath and/or alternative medicine physician.    I've had problems for years.  It was an alternative medical doctor who helped me make dietary changes that literally changed my life.  I was still tired, exhausted because sleep was so elusive for me.  It's a long story as to why it took me so long, but finally I found the right sleep doctor. Unfortunately, I wasted a year of time after I visited and worked with a sleep medicine doctor at a major sleep institute in New York City (located on West 55th Street, if anyone is interested in avoiding the place). He and the two other doctors who saw me insisted that I have insomnia -- but never ordered a sleep study.  Instead, they had me follow a sleep restriction protocol which was simply awful given especially since I don't even have insomnia.  Over a year later, urged by a friend, I went to a different sleep clinic and doctor.  An overnight study revealed a severe sleep disorder. I wish I'd know that years earlier! I'll close with this: You have to be your own advocate.  It might take a lot of work and effort to your part. Not, let me amend that: It WILL take a lot of work and effort on your part.  It's hard to put in the work and effort when you're really tired.  Believe me, I know that.  (Been there; done that, as they say.) Make it your priority, though.   Good luck and God bless. But keep plugging!
I've recently got myself a charge 2 we high tracked the sleep stages on the first night but hasn't ever since and is only showing the basic sleep information. I have already tried the solutions provided on the app such as wearing it 2-3 fingers width from the wrist bone and making sure it isn't too tight/loose. Has anybody got any other suggestions?
Many Thanks Eysa! I will try implementing your ideas. Will let you know after I overcome this
My boyfriend has used passionflower and valerian; he says they do give him vivid dreams, though.
Same as @EdsonFitbit  @DavideFitbit We wake up with the alarm clocks instead of naturally letting the body decide when to get up.. our bodies could require more rest instead and need to catch up.. That has a disadvantage to, since when 'sleeping out', getting tired later, getting out of our sleep routine.. Best to get up at the same time every day (if possible) and let the body decide when needing to go to sleep (even if it's earlier than normally to go to sleep)..
Your fitbit determines sleep based on lack of movement for an hour.  I might consider yourself restless, but essentially asleep when you lie down to read.  So what you describe sound accurate for the fitbit.  You lie down, and rest for 30 minutes, and then turn off the light, and go to sleep.  It can't tell the difference between lying down and reading versus lying down and sleeping. This happens to me sometimes (Rarely do this anymore) where I watch tv for several hours and don't move much.  I'll see a sleep log listed.  Only way I can see to fix this, is to turn off sleep detection, and enter your sleep manually.  Not sure there is an option for that, I've never noticed.

@MCWS  Restarting doesn't cause you to lose any of your data. It's similar to rebooting your computer or phone. You might not need to do a restart. You didn't mention which FitBit you have. If it's the Flex, are you tapping it to sleep mode or doing it on your phone? We'll figure this out.

Sleep cold, not warm. I keep my bedroom at 63 degrees F, and it helps.Get on a schedule.Don't drink anything for a few hours before bed.Do not read in bed, listen to the radio, or watch TV.No screen time for an hour before bed -- no computer, phone, or TV.Do not do anything in the bedroom except sleep, change clothes, and have sex. (I violate this rule by doing 10 minutes of yoga before getting in bed.)Keep the room dark.To help fall asleep, visualize a special time in your life. I like to imagine when I was a child walking on a summer day, grasshoppers humming in grass taller than my head, to a stream in , with my dog next to me. And here's a tip, if you wake in the middle of the night -- often, this works:Tense every muscle in your body and hold for a few seconds, then release the tension as you cough.
For me, it's one of two things: 1.) Nerves about big events happening in my life: shows I'm in that are having Opening Night the next night, events at work, life events, etc.2.) Sleeping in a new place: I travel a lot and need to be used to my surroundings before going to bed. Studies have shown that keeping a notepad nearby helps you sleep.  When we sleep, we are still thinking about the events of the day and things we have to do.  When one of these thoughts runs in your head, write it down in the notepad.  That way the thought is psychologically out of your mind, and therefore, you can rest easier.

Oh, you can turn it off.  Didn't realize that.
Saffire, have you had a sleep study done? If not, you might want to get one done. Best regards.
Everything I keep seeing on their app is that this will be part of a "Premium" i.e. $$ version of Fitbit.  If it ain't broke...
I'm not sure it answers your question directly, but there's lots of good info on sleep stages in their help file on the subject at https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163/
I love sleeping with my dog. But it's hot now and my boy is sleeping on the floor.
@alexthecat I'm  the same. I don't drink caffeinated coffee any more. I can only handle Swiss Water processed decaf too - ordinary chemical decaffeinated leaves too much caffeine in it. I am sleeping much better now tho!

I have misplaced the sleep pouch for Fitbit one.  Does anyone know where I can purchase another one.Thanks
The problem is that I bought the fitbit partly because of the way the sleep was tracked.  If you make a change as drastic as this, it should be an optional change.  Yes you can make everyone happy, just give the people who bought your product the option of the old way they paid for or the new way.
Sadly, I came to this forum today to find out the answer, and it's clearly not good.  From the Fitbit FAQ:Problem is, the "sleep score" is not a feature that has the slightest use for me.  I have chronic pain and need to know, in depth, when and how deeply I sleep each night--and will NEVER have a rating higher than "fair" on this measure. Fitbit seems uninterested in keeping my business.  The new screen is busy and cluttered and doesn't do what I need it to do ... when just one update ago, I was EXTREMELY happy with my Charge 3. I'll be checking out Apple Watch apps; anyone else have suggestions to replace what USED to be my favorite fitness tracker?
How to edit for a night shifter.  Lots of times I just don't sleep after my shift because I have the day off.  Not sure how to edit this. The memo pops up and says something like "thats an invalid time".  I wish it was more user friendly and more flexible to adjust.
@H8891   I'm not sure you can do "too much" cardio running, unless it causes an injury.  Increasing your fitness level tends to decrease your resting heart rate, which tends to go lower in your sleep.  Although my long distance running days are in the past, I still have a resting heart rate in the mid 40's.  My lowest sleeping heart rate is 37.  I have a Charge 5 and can't use the ECG feature -- you are supposed to be at rest, but your heart rate must be over 50 bpm.  But I agree with you, the changes you see are probably due to your increased running.

i"m a very light sleeper, and with sleep on normal setting I usually only get 2 or 3 red spikes per night. USually because I drink a LOT of water and get up at least twice a night to pee.I have 10-15 restless periods per night. On sensitive mode I was getting 20+ restless episodes, averaging about 300+ mins restless per night. But on normal it looks more like 25+ mins of restlessness. And they are spread out throughout the night. As long as you feel rested in the morning, your sleep is probably normal for you. Some people do not wake up to pee in the night, some people so not move at all (like my hubby, unless i smack him when he is snoring LOL).And look for trends. I know I sleep better when the house is cooler, and I have sleep issues the week before my period. (Yay, PMS) So as long as I turn the heat down at night, I usually have a decent sleep.
Until fitbit fixes the software glich seems the only way to fix this is to delete the sleep log and relog it manually using the same start and stop times.
I got my Charge 2 last Tuesday, put it on and left it on to explore what it can do. It's my first Fitbit and first fitness tracker ever. I am fit, exercise regularly and lead a healthy life, so I'd never felt a need for help from a gadget, but finally I broke down, interested primarily in keeping track of my heart rate and sleep patterns. I didn't sleep well on Tuesday night, but didn't make much of it. I generally sleep well, but we all have an occasional bad night. It didn't get better on Wednesday, and went downhill from there. I had difficulty falling asleep, kept waking up about every hour and then was awake at 3 am and unable to go back to sleep for a t least 1.5 hours. By Friday, I was taking a natural supplement supposed to help sleeping, and over the weekend I tried a sleeping pill. Nothing was helping. There had to be a cause for such a dramatic change, but nothing had changed in my life - no extra stress or illness, no change in diet, exercise or medications. The only thing that entered my life on Tuesday was the Fitbit. I took it off my wrist on Monday afternoon and put it away. I slept well Monday night and again last night.  I am a rational person, not prone to panic; I don't believe that cell phones are causing brain tumors, etc., but  there is no way around it - it was my Fitbit that caused my insomnia. And I don't believe it was just the discomfort from wearing it on my wrist. Considering the dramatic change in my sleep, it must have been something emitted by the device or the wireless communication going on between the tracker and my phone. I haven't been able to bring myself to put the Fitbit back on my wrist, even during the day, not knowing what it was that was affecting my sleep. I am curious if anyone else has experienced a similar problem.

That means you did not get sleep stages.  It happens occasionally to most people.See Why don't I see sleep stages today?  for some possible reasons. Also you didn't specify which trackers you have.  To get sleep stages, it must be one with heart rate readings.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Nevermind, I found the heart rate info, and yes it's there. I got the watch just a few weeks ago as a birthday present and especially wanted the sleep tracker. Thanks in advance.
I already have it set to normal. I was just wondering how accurate it is.
I sleep very poorly, and felt that my FitBit wasn't tracking quite right. So I found an app for my phone that records sound all night long. I frequently wake up - wide awake - for at least 5 minutes at a time. When I do, I simply say I'm 'I'm Awake' and the phone records my voice with a time stamp. Comparing those time stamps with my Charge 2 sleep record shows at least once or twice a night, the Charge 2 says I'm in REM or Deep sleep when I was wide awake. I have it set to sensitive. Any suggestions on how to improve the readings?
If you'd like to see if it's psychomatic, try wearing your FB when the battery's dead.   Of course, it's not really a fair trial unless you don't know if the battery is out of charge or not.  But I don't see offhand how wearing a wrist device would affect your dreaming.
If it's  not detecting your sleep automatically, you can put it in manually. It might tell you something if you put it in manually and see how active it thinks you were.
@scrow wrote:My sleep efficiency stays between 45-53%.Which sensitivity level did you select for sleep tracking in your settings: normal (default) or sensitive? If you currently have sensitive, try switching to normal. This won't change the way you are sleeping, but at least you won't get extra stress from the reported efficiency rate. I found my sleep quality improved a lot as I stopped snoring as a result of weight loss, or lower body fat (or perhaps the combination of both).

I think the difference between the 7:08 and 7:35 is that  at 7:35 you got out of bed and stayed out of bed.  The half hour before was probably time it takes to get you feet out from under the covers and on the floor as you fight to get just a bit more sleep :-).   As to completely missing your sleep, sometimes it happens. Make sure it is charged up and clean, and maybe try restarting a couple of times if it seemed to miss the night before.
I work shifts so I go to bed at all different times, sometimes at 07:30.  I have an app on my phone that puts my phone on silent when I plug it in to charge (so I don't get woken by PPI calls).  I have now got into a ritual of putting my watch on the side, phone and PS Vita onto charge and now, tap my Flex to enter sleep mode. It is early days for me so I am still motivated to track my sleep, although it is slightly depressing seeing that I only had 3 hours sleep.
Hello Fit Bit friends..This is something I saw maybe it was even on these forums.. The Fit Bit Flex has a tendencyto come unfastened and fall off and you might lose it..Here is a fis I will try myself as soon as I get to aHardware store. The O Ring in size 7 fits over the band when you have the band on and goes over the fastener and also the tab that is left after you fasten it on your wrist. it seems like a good fix as so not tolose it ((costs to much and is precious to most users also)) to be lost!!((((I took my wristband with me to be sure it was a good fit with the O Ring in the Hardware store!)))))~~~~(((((I also heard on these boards that the silicone pony tail holder which are small about 1/4 to 12 inch across and not too thick work to help by placing them over the fastener as to not let it come lose and helpyou so you do not lose your FitBit))))Good luck and If it works for anyone else..Would love to know also! I am definately trying it.Do not want to lose mine!! ... Ginny  These do not last long but for a dollar in a dollar store you get 500 or more of them..((The ones here below))
No you would not want to add the two scores, but average the two scores. Your average probably should also take into consideration the time sleeping for each period.  I find the sleep score, a highly requested by Fitbit users very valuable for getting an over all number for sleep quality. The old version really did not give much info on over all sleep quality. It was good in giving the user an idea of how long they slept. This is still shown when drilling down. The other info that i was able to see at a glance before is still availible by tapping through the individual tiles. What i miss is that i found it easier to swipe between tiles rather than having to tap and return.
Hey,I also have very short REM duration, and even if I feel terribly tired in the morning, don't forget that accuracy is not 100%.According to this video, compared to a medical device, the inspire register light sleep instead of REM in 30% of the cases :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGPV8CYGwrII wouldn't worry too much if I was you!-fx
I also have problems with excessive movement at night.   I don't have sleep apnea (tested 2x).  Seems that there is enough minor pain from arthritis, acid refux disease,  and non-specific autoimmune disease to make me reposition during the night to relieve pain or keep the extremities from going numb/sore.  The movement doesn't always wake me up when the body repositions itself.----I take Naproxen (Aleve) or Advil only as needed because continual use seems to be less effective.  Same complaint that some people have with sleeping pills.----Try using blackout curtains/blinds; turn off or cover any digital lights (ex: time on alarm clock);  eat protein with carb at bedtime (ex: milk & peanut butter sandwich); wear socks (feet hitting cold spots will wake you up); use heavy blankets  (weight on body is comforting) and keep warm;  take Epsom salt/baking soda baths (helps with pain & body absorbs magnesium);  keep regular sleep hours; use the bedroom only for sleep and sex (body responds better with scheduled activities-sorry no tv, internet or reading in bed); cut out liquids (will help eliminate full bladder wake-ups) and caffinee/alcohol several hours before bedtime....earlier if sensitive to caffinee (both cause insomnia); use white sounds (a running fan works well)----Double check your medications...some cause insomnia by themselves or when interactting with other drugs or food. (Pharmacists are great sources of knowledge about this).---Remember, other known or unknown issues can also cause movement at night or wakeful periods.  ex: ulcers, stress, overeatting (stomach is digesting rather than resting), allergies, sleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, etc.---The Fitbit just helps you realize you might have a problem.  Good Luck!
there are still technological limitations when it comes to measuring sleep. one thing you can do though is get enough data with your fitbit to form a trend of some sort, then work from there. if your graph is tight with not so much highs or lows (plus, you aren't feeling tired or sluggish the rest of the day), you are sleeping right.

I just recently changed my selection for sleep from sensitive to normal.  It was giving me readings of 2 to 3 hours sleep each night.  I know that I have trouble staying asleep as well as falling asleep, but I felt as if I was getting more sleep than that.  Now I feel that I'm not getting as much sleep as my Fitbit says I'm getting (8-9 hours).  Has anyone else had a similar issue?
In general I'm a bad sleeper. Recently, take naps become an habit for me. At the beginning I felt great then my nap went from 1 hour to two or three hours 😬. Worst, in the night I don't sleep well. 
 
In fact, I just realized long or irregular napping can negatively affect your sleep. Sleep in the daytime can confuse your body and having you awake more time when is time to go sleep in the night. I started to sleep better during the day than in the night.
 
How long should be a power nap ? Personally, I don't feel like 20 min are enough for a nap. 😅
 
What do you think ?

@stephanie77 Since the tracker is linked to your account, any tracked data from the tracker will also appear onto your account. Your husband needs his own account and tracker.
Fitbit will not auto-detect sleep of less than an hour.  You can still get credit for this on phone app:Sleep Tile > "+" at top right > Begin Sleep NowThen 'I'm Awake' when wake up, but will not get sleep stages or score with less than 3 hours sleep.

Cool @Stephen1227
I am currently on sleep restrictive therapy...meaning I turn off the light at midnight and I get out of bed at 5:30.  For those of you unfamiliar with this it is a method used for resetting your circadian rhythm. The app said I went to bed at 11:45 or something like that and I woke up at 5:53 I believe.  When I tried to correct it, the app deleted the rhythm that showed what stages of sleep I had during the night. Clearly this isn't meant to replace actual clinical data, but it is a useful tool to track.  What is your mean time for the system to be able to provide a rhythm chart?  Something is not working correctly and deleting all of the stages.  Correcting minutes shouldn't delete critical data.  We should be able to tweak the time to correct it and NOT lose critical data.   (**Please note 5.5 hours of sleep is the minimum for this and guided by a doctor.  You should not sleep less than 5.5 hours)
@G2EWS wrote:It is very easy to see just how good fitbit is at tracking sleep. Don't look at your sleep pattern and see how you feel during the day. I always know I have had more than 90 minutes continuous sleep - which you need to get to REM - by the way I feel. Never been wrong in years of fitbit ownership. I don't take any notice of the percentages as the only key bit of information needed is if you can get to 90 minutes in one go.  Regards  Chris@G2EWS Are you using an HR Model Fitbit. ? If so, you can create a Custom Activity and get your HR graph for the hours asleep, the Charge HR thinks your are asleep if your use the button, and the activity record finishes up in the sleep area, hence the Custom Activity. The Surge will track sleep in one minute graphs if you use its Workout button Here is mine from last night and the night from the Charge HR using a Custom activity.  Extra blankets on last night. These are one minute graphs.

Hi @Ari44! Sometimes I have difficulties with sleeping, I don't exercise that much but exercise helps you with giving you energy and you sleep better at night.

Thanks, Laurie, I suspected that might be the case. Another possibility that occurred to me was to split a sleep log into two, the first one ending when I woke in the night, and the second one starting when I went back to sleep. That would give a false Sleep Score, I think, because a period awake would be ignored, but the time logged as asleep would be more accurate.
so when you click on that tile in the app, what do you see? can you post a picture?

I just upgraded from the original Flex to a Charge 3 and am impressed with the detail I get regarding my sleep patterns. I've only had it a few days but I found this fitbit article very helpful and will work toward getting better sleep. I was impressed that it knew when I went to bed and woke up.  With my Flex I had to tap on it to tell it when I went to bed and woke up. Now I don't need to do that. https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163
No, it doesn't monitor your sleep. Here is the link to the Zip manual and articles.

I have the same problem. The suggest solution, installing the update, hasn't fixed it. It has been over a month and my nightly sleep sometimes still shows up in the old style. Randomly.
Yes, it does. The watch shows daily last night's SpO2 (I think that is the average score , and last night's range.Sometimes it just skips a day, for unknown reasons.There's no place where I can view this kind of history.
And you can confirmed you have sleep insights turned on (see bottom of the pic)?

@BernadetteDavie As long as it is an opinion, yes. But when this is not an opinion. It is not my opinion the sky is blue, it is blue, period. Do not make the mistakes of thinking everything is an opinion and that they are equal. Because both statements are wrong.
I am having the same concern.  My husband and I both just got Fitbit and we love it, overall.  Although, the past couple of nights we have been experimenting with the sleep settings.  The first night we set them on sensative and both ours said we only got 4 and 5 hours of sleep.  The next night I changed mine to "normal" and mine said I got 7 hours and 45 min.  Last night, back to sensative and said I got 3 hours and 36 min. out of 9 hours.  I really think that the sensative setting has to be really sensative, possible tracking my body movement due to my husband moving in the bed while I am still sleeping, which doesn't make is that accurate for me.  I would love to believe that the "normal" setting was more accurate, but the extreme difference in the two are a little concerning. Any advice?
Customer service mentioned there is no way to eliminate it at this time. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Health, more/less need for sleep, work time, etc. Should have an opt out option, even a toggle switch like they have for other items on the dashboard. Poor that this was added with no notice or feedback. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Night.

Last night was the first time I used my new Charge HR and figured it was a good test of a bad night of sleep for me. I was pretty restless, I thought, and I know I was up for a couple of hours because I gave up and started watching Netflix during the wee hours. But I guess I'm pretty still watching a video, so that awake time wasn't captured and my Charge reported a pretty good night, supposedly 8 hours of sleep. Anyone else encounter this? Any suggestions for the Charge picking up my actual awakeness, even if I'm not a big mover?

That's wild! what's in your spaghetti sauce? Lol!It's probably just the melatonin;) Thanks for the tip.
That worked. Man. What a pain. Come on fitbit fix this.
You are onto aomething with keeping a jpurnal maybe fitbit could add a sleep journal comment section to each day!?
I am always around 29 time restless during the night, I guess I am not a great sleeper.
Me too!  Have no idea why they will not let us share sleep data with whomever we select.  I used to have the UP24 and it allowed it with out any issues and Fitbit is for more superior so just does not make sense.
Sadly, this is a typical night for me.  I normally don't look at sensitive mode because it depresses me...
When you are tired you also tend to overeat if you are not careful. The body has a hard time regulating hormones and therefore we crave junk food more.

The Zip does not track sleep.  That is why I did not get it.
@MisterBrett I don't know what a CPAP device is Yes I looked on the settings in the app now and see that it is in sensitive mode (but still finds that I tracks time as sleeping when just laying down trying to fall asleep)  Thanks
I'm reading this book at the moment, after listening to the authors podcast on the subject. It's really insightful and I definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their sleep - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep-Smarter-Proven-Better-Success/dp/0984574522 Last night I applied magnesium oil directly to my skin before bed as advised by this author and, although I slept for a shorter amount of time due to commitments last night, both my REM and deep sleep showed as much improved according to my sleep stages.

Fit bit Is seriously lacking in the area of sleep interpretation.  They offer this tool to track your sleep, but no information on how to understand it. So frustrating.  I've had my Fit bit for a year. I sleep horribly.  Last night I had 59 minutes of restless/awake. This is not abnormal for me and I'm always tired.  But without an understanding of the data it's basically useless.
Particularly when I am very tired, I will fall asleep on my recliner with a cat on top of me, earlier than my start time.  If I am hard off, my partner will leave me there. I'll wake up in the early hours of the morning - 3am - 4am - and then I'll get up for a few minutes, do the before bed things, then go to bed, where I will sleep for another 3 or 4 hours until my usual waking time.I'd like like to see these joined into one night for total sleep purposes, preferably automatically, but if not manually.  Is there anything now I can do?
No, there is no alarm for skin temperature.But for the "smart watches", primarily the Versa family, and Sense which is essentially a high end Versa, people can develop their own apps and clock faces.  I myself don't do any such development but from the little I have seen, that seems like something could possibly be done.

I do crossfit 3 to 4 times a week. I definitely feel tired and out of it in the daytime. My memory is horrible as well. Why are my REM and Deep numbers half of what most other people are? I think the numbers are fairly accurate because the numbers change drastically if someone else puts on my watch.
Ah ok thanks .. il try it tonight and see then .. I was hoping that wouldmean I could turn my phone off ..😕

Hey!I notcied this as well, and sometimes it will track me as sleeping even when I am not. You should check your settings to see if sleep tracking is on normal or sensitive, as I had to change mine to normal. You could also try making your fitbit a bit more loose when you sleep? I notice when mine is tighter it tracks me as being more restless/awake than I actually am. Hope that helps!
Are you turning the sleep mode on and off during the night? You don't want to do that. Turn it to sleep when you get into bed and take it off when you get up in the morning. If you get up during the night, leave it in sleep mode. That's how you know how often you were awake. Yes, it is based on movement, but I have found it to be pretty accuarate. If you are deeply asleep, you aren't moving. If you are restless, you aren't deeply asleep.
I wouldn't say it's helped me sleep better.  However I've found it to be fairly accurate as best I can tell (bed and wake times right, REM times seem to line up with when I've awakened with dreams, etc).  What I've found it useful to do is let me know better when I might be able to push myself with a late night or two so I can work on projects, or when it might be a better idea to pack it in early and pop a melatonin.  If my trend for the last few days is over target (which I set at my long-term average of 6 hours), I have some margin I can spend.  If I have a few days well under that... time to catch up.
Dreams are special. Some are unique, the scary ones may stay away.  Only got once but woke up in a dream while still dreaming and everything felt real. Going to bed in the dream (romantic thingies before that..) but waking up again and still dreaming.. until woke up another time and confused was really awake or still in the dream. Another time woke up but couldn't move and say anything yet.. until minutes later. 🙀 Stayed by one time (it was scary).
Colin has explained this well. I would like to add I completely understand why fitbit isn't pulse based and I am very leery of products that say they can use your pulse. So many things interfere with getting a pulse, movement, sweat, how tightly the product contacts your skin, etc. At the same time I started using my fitibit I bought a 'pulse reading' watch. If I push the watch against my wrist and touch the bezel in two places I create a contact that reads my pulse. IF I am completely still and IF I am not very sweaty then I get a fairly accurate reading. If I am moving AT ALL or if I am very sweaty the reading varies wildly. This watch was not cheap. It tells time accurately...
I've been using the normal setting. About to go to sleep with it set to sensitive so ill report back in the morning with how it's done.I usually get around 93-97% on normal
I don’t think you missed anything in set up @SunsetRunner   SPO2% doesn’t show up on the website.  It shows up on the app on the Home Screen under, not sleep, but “health metrics.”

Hi only 1 Jethro,Melatonin is made in the  complete dark so wearing a sleep mask to block out light is important. Melatonin production tends to wan as we age. Also, if you has too much on the brain that prevents sleep then write out your concerns and what steps you will take to improve your situation. Then it is down and you can remind you mind that you won't forget.Exercising but not right before sleep tends to makes us tired at night. When you find a form of exercise that you can do then do it like clockwork.Losing weight often is necessary for health and good sleep. Don't eat within 2 hours of bedtime.If you are overweight ask for a sleep study to see if you have sleep apnea. That needs attention immediately and the use of a c pap machine.Maybe you need earplugs if your hubbie snores! Eat only super healthy food. Piles of veggies raw & lightly steamed, some beans & lentil, salads, and only lean protein like fish or poultry. Avoid white flour, rice, sugar, pasteries, fast food, junk foods, etc.You can do this. Make the changes for a healthier life.Set reseasonable goals and do the work to get there.We support you.Barbara G

Oh sorry I was conflating benchmarks with the data graph -.-   I think benchmarks are a cellphone exclusive - I've never seen them on Dashboard.
I read a good rule of thumb the other day regarding the correct dosage for taking melatonin: "if you're still not getting to sleep quicking or not staying asleep, you're taking too little; if you're getting very weird dreams, you're taking too much."  It's been working for me: 2 mg was too little; 5 mg was too much, and 3 mg seems to be working perfectly.

How do I get a better nights sleep? I am up until 10 o'clock at soccer practice every week night and then I still have homework to finish up. How can I have more time to sleep, I end up taking 1 or 2 hour naps every day after school. Because of those naps I can't fall asleep when I am supposed to. Any tips?

I updated my app today and lost all of my sleep data. Bummed. I wonder what else is amiss.
Put the setting (normal vs sensitive) on the one that more accurately reflects how you feel the next day.  For example, when I first got mine and it was on the Normal setting, it said I was sleeping about 6-7 hours.  Yet I wake up feeling incredibly tired every day.  I switched it to sensitive, and it more accurately depicts how I really sleep.  I actually just went to the sleep clinic yesterday for a study because mine is so bad.  I knew I wasn't sleeping well, but I didn't realize it was down to 3-4 hours EVERY night.  Keep in mind that a partern's movement may also make it show you as restless.  And of course that if you're lying still, it thinks you are asleep when you could be just counting sheep.  Most people move around in their sleep somewhat, so that is not uncommon either.
Hey everybody.I would recommend putting your vote in on this request on the Suggestion board, which Fitbit developers actively monitor for new requests. The more votes a suggestion gets, the better chance it has at being implemented.

That's not my question. I know I can look at hours but I want my weekly hours average back. As a shift worker this was vital. Sleep score is pointless, makes no sense and is inaccurate
I am having exactly the same problem since last Friday can't wait for them to rectify the issue
I don't think sleep is based on your pulse, I think it is based on your movement. If you move over a certain threshold, that's restless sleep. I don't know if awake is a lot of movement (over another threshold) or if it senses you have stood up, maybe both. But I don't think the fitbit has the capability to measure heart rate or pulse.
No, You are fine. I am a Respiratory Therapist for 40 yrs. The symptoms are loud snoring and daytime sleepiness. Falling asleep during the day. Feeling tired after sleeping.
You can go into any log of the sleep tracked and edit those. For example on the phone go into the sleep tile. There click on the day you want to edit. At the top right corner should be three dots next to eachother. Click on that and you can edit or delete any log here. In your case it might also be helpful to tell the app when you are going to sleep and when you are awake again. Again in the app, but this time click the + sign at the bottom. Select log sleep and click Begin Sleep Now. Similar when waking up.

Never worked. Had some random records and that's it. Who else has still this same issue?
This has happened to me also- hence why i am looking on this forum for some explanations!!
Hello everyone,I'm part of a team researching how some devices (including fitbit charge 2) are used and how they affect the sleep of their users. If anyone is willing to have a conversation regarding how they use it, what they like or dislike, what they would like to see removed or implemented or any such things, let me know. Any help would be much appreciated.Thanks in advance and have a great day.
A lot of this has to do with your lifestyle. Melatonin has no impact on sleep duration - it just send a message to your brain that it's time to shut down.  If you were to adopt a sleep cycle that started at 10 or 11pm, I think you'd find that your sleep duration would change.

At night, my Alta tracks my movements accurately. I check my watch when I get up to do whatever, and the tracker catches my wake times on point. I think naps are too short for it to gain enough data to make the graph.
That is exactly what mine is doing too...it has only started this the lastfew weeks...not sure what's up with it...

My normal resting heart rate is typically in the mid to high 60s.  However, over the past few days, it suddenly spiked to as high as 76 - due to a high heart rate while sleeping.  For example, I woke up in the middle of the night with a heart rate I don't usually see unless I'm doing moderate exercise!  I'm a 39 year old, fairly active female (I work out five times a week, either on my own or taking a class and walk almost everywhere.  I typically clock 20K steps or more each day).   I should also add that I have had secondary amenorrhea for a few years (unrelated to sleep), so I don't think it's early menopause.
I had the same, its been using the Sleep stages for about 3 weeks now, but for some reason last nights one went back to the the pattern mode.  The sleep monitoring is the main reason i use the fitbit so having it go back to the old setting isn't good
I have always been tired during the day, and used caffeine to keep me awake.  Before getting my fitbit, I had started thinking it was just in my head, as I have tried multiple sleeping pills, etc and still have to drag myself out of bed each morning.  Well, I got my fitbit and discovered it is not in my head! My sleep efficiency stays between 45-53%.  I have tried cutting out caffeine in the afternoon, cutting out alcohol, using a sleep mask, sound machine, aromatherapy, sleeping pills, and a herbal supplement for sleep.  At this point I am starting to get agitated because it doesn't seem like anything is working 😞
I have recently begun tracking my sleep using the Charge 5 and have an occasional problem with sleep tracking. For many years now I have made it a habit of waking up at sometime during the night, generally between midnight and 2 AM, to read for about an hour using my tablet. The FitBit algorithm interprets this as waking up followed by a second period of sleep causing it to report two sleep sessions both with a low sleep score due to the short sleep periods.  Is there any way I can change a software setting that will report my nightly reading session as an awake time in one continuous session of sleep rather than breaking it up into two? Thanks for your advice.
Accordingly to Fitbit, my resting heart rate is from 50 to 53, to me is normal. I exercise 6 times a week.
Hi @Tezi For most of your quetsions, nobody here can answer for you. You'd have to talk with a doctor and get a sleep study done to be sure. It could be an accuracy issue, but if you're consistently feeling bad when you don't get enough deep sleep, there may be something to that. Again, the doctor would have to verify. From the small amount of research I've done, it seems the deep sleep is tied more to the physical part of us, where REM is tied more to the mental/emotional side. I notice when I have a lot of mental acitvity, or a lot of emotions to process, the REM goes up and deep goes down. When I don't get enough deep sleep, my physical performance goes down. If I don't get enough REM, then my mind tends to get foggier. I haven't figured out how to control any of that, just observed it in my case.

I drop straight into deep sleep due to a good relaxing massage each night from partner. But my heart rate is high during deep sleep. I thought it was supposed to be low. is there any way I can lower my heartrate during the early stages of sleep for me? see my pics below
Does the sensitive sleep setting pick up bed partner restlessness? I feel like the normal setting does not really know when I’m restless but the sensitive setting seems to think I’m restless the entire night.
Thank you for the information
Please I need an explanation about this Score sleep.

My Charge 2 told me this morning that I got a whole 58 minutes of deep sleep last night. Shame that it logged the time when I was sat talking to my wife , she's now asking if I was really listening to her......
@Gstsaver I've used a Polar chest strap to measure HRV and found the numbers that I get from my Fitbit to be very different. That does make sense to me because they are different devices and they measure HRV differently.Most people consider the chest strap to be the gold standard for heartrate measurement and I agree with that. While my Fitbit doesn't agree with the chest strap in terms of absolute numbers, the overall trends do mirror one another. Based on that, I would suggest looking at how your HRV is changing over time and not put too much emphasis on a particular number on a given day.

Hi guys,  i am just wondering how much REM and deep sleep others get as much as how many times they wake up a night so if you want, you can share screenshots of your typical night!
Mine shows the same info on the tracker, as it does on the app on my phone, as it does online on my dashboard.
It is almost 20 years that use a bite. I have seen an endless number of doctors and dentists. In the past I took pills that would lower the tension on my muscles. Those pills at time would help but not solving bruxism. Perhaps the placebo component of taking the pills or the drops was the most important effect.About year ago I have tried with botulinum. Low doses of botulinum are injected on the masseter muscles. In a couple of months I have noted a result and my morning pain has almost disappeared. Not much scientific literature is available but you can search on the net and it is mentioned.I still use my bite, I never forget to clench and grind but with I do it with lower intensity which is for me is great relief.BestJoeVileda
I’ve bought a fit bit for Christmas & the sleep, heart rate & steps tile worked the first 3 days and now they’ve disappeared. I’ve tried editing the Today page but they don’t appear. I’ve just paid for Premium to see if that helps but when I go to the Wellness report page to access Health & Fitness Stats & click on the Sleep icon Open is all greyed out and not available to select. The same occurs with heart rate & Hourly steps. This is my first fit bit and iam really not impressed. It’s been nothing but trouble & stress setting it up so far. Fitbit/Google can you please help how to resolve this problem. I’ve uninstalled the app & reinstalled it numerous times. Shut down the charge 5. Checked Bluetooth on & off. And nothing has helped. If this cannot be resolved easily I want a refund as it seems nothing but bother.
@Doctari To add to my earlier posts here is a link to another area where I showed how you can "home" in on a particular area of your HR.

I have had this issue as well. The only thing that seems to help is to make sure your watch is fully charged. But even that is not a guarantee. Two nights ago the watch said I slept for 2 hours, then nothing for 3 hours and then it said I slept 1.5 hours! Even though I was asleep the whole time!Then last night it had me sleeping 6 hours straight through and I had not charged the battery!

I used to snore (and probably have some kind of sleep apnea), but that stopped after I lost weight (75 to 65 kg). In fact, improvement in sleep quality was likely the biggest benefit of my weight loss (amazing how just 10 kg can make such a big difference). Now the main challenge for me in terms of sleep is my growing prostate (I’m sure other older guys can relate): I must remember to stop drinking after 6-8pm, otherwise I’ll probably need to take a trip to the bathroom once or twice during the night.

Hello... I'm have been using Fitbit Alta Hr since 20 Aug'17 and everything seems good. But on last Friday I set up new sleep schedule. This device didn't show me the sleep stages anymore. I restarted but no change. I tried to read the solution from many people but nothing happened. So now I don't know what to do 😞Anyone knows please advice me  Thank you!
I've noticed it tends not to track this, like if i fall asleep on a plane. Likely < 1 hour and probably some movement. Thx.
Greetings, and I hope it is okay to cross post from where I asked this (similarly) in the product forum.  I am hoping to get some help from the community.  Something weird has happened to my sleep logs, and a portion of the data appears to be gone.  I tried to manually input a log for a time frame when I know I was sleeping (and no information shows up), and it would not allow me to do it.  It is correctly telling me that a sleep log already exists for this time, as it should be, right?  I was sleeping.  But the information does not show up in the app.  How do I go about getting it to show up?  I've rebooted the fitbit, force stopped the app, uninstalled and reinstalled the app.  What else can I do?  I would like to at least add a log of the time I spent in bed attempting to sleep.  Thanks in advance.  This happened not long after I switched phones, and there was a brief issue with time zones, so that may be contributing.  I'm using Inspire 2 with a Galaxy J2 phone.

My problem is the wrist strap isn't large enough for my wrists. 😞
Supposedly, if we enter REM stage, we're dreaming. So, I suppose it's fair to say I remember some dreams. I remember once, I fell asleep on a water bed (dating myself) with the heater turned on too high. I dreamed I was a bismark (a donut without the hole) frying in grease. Every 45 seconds, a giant pole would poke me and make me roll over. Oddly enough, this dream occurred, I believe, because I was working the opening night at a Dunkin' Donuts in Tallahassee. I must have fried 100 screens of bismarks the night before. Lately, most of my dreams are about work - trying to find the "unicorn" for a particular recruiting assignment. (someone with a set of skills so unique, they are believed to not exist. )

Hi @L_MMRC, Yes, it's an issue with Fitbit, and they're working on it. As far as I know, there's nothing you can do on your end, other than make sure you're getting heart rate signal during the night.

Is this the same as having a hard time getting a deep breath upon waking. It doesn't always happen to me, just occasionally.
It's always rare when I feel refreshed after eight hours of sleep. But I have been getting eight hours of sleep everyday and the majority of it is restless. 5-6 hours of my sleep tends to be restless and 1-3 hours is deep sleep. First of all, is this normal? I never am in deep sleep for more then three hours. This has come to my attention ever since I got the FitBit. How can I decrease the amount of restlessness during sleep and feel refreshed when I wake up?

Thank you so much for the clarification. i will do this tonight before i go to sleep. you helped out a lot.
I barely snore, maybe once a week for a little bit. Sometimes I snort myself awake, but that is usually when I start to fall asleep, and again, it is maybe once a week. I doubt it is apnea.
Hello,
 
I was wondering if it's possible to judge if I have sleep apnea or not from the sleep stats, in conjunction with the health metrics such as Breathing Rate (BR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and SpO2?
I sleep fairly poorly most nights, around the 5h mark a night. Some nights it's only 3-4h, those are usually followed by a 6h night. 
 
When I look at BR, HRV and SpO2 on those very poor nights, things get a bit weird. BR tends to go over my personal range, HRV drops fairly significantly and SpO2 can get down to 92%. Even though I've never been a very good sleeper, the past two years, and I feel now with the lockdown even more, my sleep has gotten worse. Is there anything I could conclude from these statistics?

I want every night to show in the bar graph regardless if captured other details. That was my most used feature so could see at a glance progress or lack of across the week.  Even in your example there are bars missing between nights.
I have a fitbit 2. The sleep tracker has gone crazy. One day it said i did 30 minutes aerobic exercise during sleep, but the HR is 65. Then this whole week it says i 2 hours from 9/10 to midnight and thrn from 4 to 6 in the morning, when i was asleep the whole time. I'm about to throw this away.
It does sound around normal. For me, an hour of deep sleep is still under the benchmark, but that varies by age group. It is pretty typical to see more deep sleep earlier in sleep and more REM later. I don't have much to add about keto, but sleep is an important function. You could say, I'm even addicted to it. 🙂

no sleep data recorded last night for some reason?  It has been working and then I went to bed early to get up early to work on a project and it simply did not record the data.
I have the flex. I think I figured out what I did wrong. You have to tap the flex until it buzzes to turn the sleep mode on and off. I thought I shut it off this morning but I didn't, so when I synced it, there was no sleep to log since it was still running but it's in my log now

My heart rate graph during sleep doesn’t show any readings, but it shows the average Bpm and percentages of what it is through the night. I tried resetting the app and that didn’t work turned off and on my watch, still not working. Please help...
I really wish I can sleep as well as my wife. Last night, being Friday night, we told ourselves before bedtime that we will both sleep in. Not sure why it works well for us, but maybe the fact that we conditioned our minds prior to falling asleep.  I slept for 61/2 hours with 1 hour and 19 minutes of deep sleep, about 11/2 hours of waking time with a score of 79.
 
I know she's always been a better sleeper but this time I was convinced that I will beat her. It was my best sleeping night for more than 6 months. FYI, I usually only average 51/2 hours of sleep and about 35 minutes of deep sleep. Guess what, she slept for 7 hours and 59 minutes and with a deep sleep of 1 hour and 55 minutes and a score of 84. Ah, well, better luck next time to me.

I am a user of a Fitbit Inspire (upgraded from a flex 2 about a month ago).  My three main interests are Sleep Management, Exercise and weight management. Today my question is regarding the inaccuracy of the sleep tracking on my Fitbit Inspire.     I am an older woman (67) and am up and down at night.  The tacker does not track this activity.  It seems to quit tracking once I get up for a sleep break.  So my hours of sleep tend to show as 2-4 hours instead of whatever it actually is.  What can I do to track this more successfully?
It doesn't show many stages at all - not tracking my HR consistently, nomatter how I wear it....same thing throughout the day
I live in CA and need a good sleep doctor to help me get better sleep.  I have been struggling for years and it is starting to really effect my cognitive and memory functioning.  A sleep specialist that can help me with getting better REM sleep is what I need.  I have tried changing times and other stuff but nothing helps.  I really feel like it might be neurological or somehow related to brain functioning.  If you know of a specialist in Northern Ca. that might be able to help me please let me know.  Thanks to anyone that can help.

Keep up the good work going to sleep around the same time, and trying to get 7-8 hours a day. You are doing better than I am. Does your app still show the 18hr bug?
My neighbor had restless leg syndrome.  She said drinking a small glass of milk in the evenings stopped the leg movement.  Might be worth a try!
I had a Sleep Score 90 recently where it was typically around the 80's..  For others here I have Premium so I can analyse these scores. Why ?.... I had a walking, "over use" issue in my calf muscles and my RHR shot up to 61. The sleep  Restoration results had my sleeping HR at 95% under the elevated RHR.. I have genetic low HR.. See this link which reported an odd error about sleep  but the graph is there on the 11th December with a score of 22/25.. @Baltoscott  and @LZeeW  I feel the mathematics is incorrect in this case because I lowered the RHR after physio after 3 days and it's remained constant at 57 bpm now, on the way to 52 again..  The sleeping HR is back to 40-50% under the new RHR which gives me a score of 17/25.. Overall beck to a Sleep Score of 80  @SilviaFitbit is handling the error in the link and I'm hoping there is more thought on the RHR and Sleeping HR.  Or, maybe, I'm just the genetic odd one, and come outside the normal distribution bell curve of the Fitbit population. But the Sleep scoring works for me with the restless nights, because in Melbourne (Australia) we are having our typical weather of 4 seasons in a week, except rain..  It will be 44oC (111oF)  today and 21oC (70oF) tomorrow, It was 41oC (106oF) 2 days ago and the same drop again yesterday.

Last night, after going to bed at 9:30 and getting up at 7:30, the app said I slept one hour and 54 minutes.  Night before there was no sleep data detail. I'm not doing anything different. And today - network problem. I hope you get it fixed soon...
Hithank you for your reply. I have now managed to reset the heart rate monitor.
I have 2 different sleep " kinds of music" one is the typical thunderstorm you can do this with a sleep machine or a tablet that you download a series of thunderstorms and then loop it to repeat. my other is a song my husband recently found called weightless...

Same issue! Every night at 10pm. All notifications are turned off. App and OS are up to date. I've been a Fitbit user for a long time am really getting frustrated with the lack of quality. Continual issues syncing my Charge 3 as well. Fitbit you are losing loyal customers!
I'm not terribly familiar with Android, but I gather that if Google Play says the app is Installed, then I have the most current version. What version do you have? (Go to Settings, General, Application Manager, and select Fitbit),

I have the Charge HR and like @Tinman53 says, I don't have to do anything but wear the Fitbit to bed for it to record my sleep. That said, sometimes if I am lounged out on the couch (watching a movie, for instance), the Fitbit will think I went to sleep because I am dormant for so long. That is my fault of course. Also, if I am lying still in bed but not asleep (I have trouble falling asleep), it will record me as being asleep when I am still awake. Either way, I think you can go into the logging option and edit your sleep, but I don't know if you have a different interface than I do (Flex vs. Charge HR).
Hi Rashboots, you should be able to view the data in either mode after the record is stored (it took me forever to figure out it would let me do this). Here is my sensitive version from last night: If you click on the "edit data" you can select Normal mode then save the record. It'll update it to a "normal" view. I normally pop it back to sensitive when I'm done so the charts are consistent.
While I agree that fitbit cannot diagnose OSA, I can tell you that my fitbit is behaving differently after having been diagnosed with OSA and been on CPAP treatment for a week now.  My fitbit never used to automatically read my sleep - I always had to force it into monitoring my sleep, then click the button again when I woke up.  Now, the fitbit is doing this automatically, and it's surprisingly accurate in registering how long I've been sleeping.  So, while it will not diagnose OSA, it appears to be able to provide another data point that you may have OSA.  In other words, if you're fitbit won't automatically track your sleep without your intervention, it may be a good idea to speak with your doctor about the possibility that you may have OSA.
Sorry, I typed too fast, a lot of typos.
Try 1 hour of cardio at 5AM, then see how it affects REM that night.

I had a similar experience. On the fifteenth day I began getting regular sleep stage readings. I also stopped (then) tracking sleep by hitting "sleep now" and "awake." The Charge 2 more or less gets my sleep start correct on it's own. And my awake seems to correspond with when I pick up my phone to swipe to for a sync in the morning.
I think the new deep sleep stage is because in 8 hours of sleep 6 minutes of deep and 40 minutes of light makes a smaller impact than 6 minutes in a 46 minutes time ftam for 3 hours of sleep. Like 6/460 versus 6/180

Exactly! I think the adrenaline makes the most sense. I often have the feeling of being wired up and take a while to come down. But even when I don’t have times like that I have the above-resting at night. Over the years I have had a few incidents of intense chest pain in the middle of the night. It has not happened in at least a year. I’ve also fainted a handful of times over the years. I had the basic tests ran. ECG, EKG, Holter monitor (also to look for the skips and flutters I feel at times). Nothing was ever found. Anyhow, thanks a bunch for responding. I’m probably going to try to get to the doc next week because my mother did pass in her sleep (unexpectedly) several months ago and that’s got me wanting answers even more. Take care!
I've only had my fitbit for a few days, but it confirmed what I already guessed that I am a very heavy sleeper.  So far, I've only had one awakening during each night, which I know it was true because I got up to go to the bathroom.  Then I usually have 1 or 2 "restless" instances, for only 1 - 2 minutes each. Your awakenings do seem high, but I don't know what is normal.  It could only mean that you move a lot when you sleep.  Or maybe you're not getting fully into deep sleep.  What is your sleeping envrironment like?  Is it fully dark?  Is the temperature comfortable?  Is it quiet?  Do you take in a lot of caffein during the day?  I've been reading a lot lately about the negative effects of blue light from computer screens and tvs disturbing the sleep cycle, so if you fall asleep with the tv on or use your computer right before bed, that may messing with you.
@Ms.Renewed Hi! Thank you for sharing this. Your tips are so good and I'm more than sure that they work. 
 
Most nights, I have trouble sleeping and I'm always looking for a way to get more sleep and timely. Have tried a lot of things, and some have worked. However, I think this breathing exercise should work perfectly. If we get to that point in which we feel so relaxed; sleep should come through smoothly and effective. 
 
I will definitely try this tonight, I'm sure it will help me sleep. The only thing that is very hard for me is to get my mind blank. I'm always thinking when in bed, and that is one of the reasons why I have trouble sleeping.

I also suffer from sleep apnea and have a CPAP. I've actually not used mine in a while because I usually fall asleep on the couch in front of the TV since I work second shift. At some point in the night, I'll wake up enough to go to bed and then fall back asleep. Once I'm half asleep, I don't think clearly enough to realize what's going on around me. I keep telling myself I'm going to start using the CPAP again because my sleep is erratic. I found the nasal mask was not a good choice for me because I do have sinus problems and allergies. My nasal passages are frequently congested. I often breathe through my mouth when laying down. The full face mask was a better choice for me.
I was trying to have it start tracking my sleep but I'll give that a shot. Thanks!

For years, I have had the need to get up several times each night. The last few days, I tried a trainer's suggestion to not eat or drink after the dinner meal. That also has cut out junk calories. Last night went very well; I slept through. I stopped eating and drinking around 4:00pm. The prior day, I stopped around 5:00pm and that wasn't early enough.
I have the same results on my graph. I have restless leg syndrome. It is a different sleep disorder. I didn’t know I had it until a doctor had me do a sleep test for sleep apnea; I was surprised by the results. Google it.
I can't find the setting on my Versa either.
So you found 2 ways to monitor sleep with the Fitbit app, and you want to know which one to use, correct?I think you would have to clarify the 2 ways.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Mine spikes an hour or so after I've gone to sleep. Often to a level that's as high as it would be when I'm awake. This seems to sync up with times that I'm in deep sleep. Though this would seem counter intuitive.
I love getting badges. And I also believe sleep is still underrated. So.....I think as Fitbit users we need sleep badges. I know Jawbone users get them. I want them too 🙂
Thanks for responding to my call for help. I put the tracker into'count' mode making it it run on and on, if that's what you mean by"tapping". Then I go to the sleep log icon on Dashboard and clickit. Then I get a setup windows with blanks on Start Time and EndTime. I fill then in with the times I will by going to sleep thatnight and when I plan to get up, then it says its famous statement""There is already ...." Do you do anything different?Xeno
Hi all...I'm currently using a Fitbit Alta HR as my main sleep tracker and while it's doing a 'good' job, I was wondering about the newer Fitbit trackers and if they would be better.  Does anyone know if the new line, i.e Versa 2, Versa Lite, etc. are better than the Alta HR for more accurate detection on when I fall asleep and the quality of my sleep?
Has anyone else taken their stats in to a sleep clinic?  What exactly did you take?  ( I don't have a 'smart' phone to show the doctor, so will need to print it out from my computer.  It seems the sleep stats on my computer shows a graph for the last month.  Is there more I can do?
One of my dogs is very restless and she must lay on or right next to me. I think she is the one who affects the sleep tracking.
I had a period in my life when I sleep very badly. I could lie with open eyes until morning. It's horrible. I think stress was the cause. I was in college then and moonlighting in a cafe. I did not have time for anything, I was constantly nervous, I think this caused disturbances in sleep. In general, this is very important, you can read in more detail here https://studymoose.com/sleep about this topic. I didn't take any pills, I just put my life in order. I stopped staring at the phone before going to bed, meditation also helped.
I'm getting a maximum of less than an hour of deep sleep each night, with a maximum overall time of less than 5 hours. When will an app to measure oxygen levels be available, and which devices will work with it?

Good Morning, I guess I'm really late to this party, but wanted to step in and say that the CPAP has also changed my life. I believe I'm sleeping better and my quality of life has changed enourmasly. The one question I have is, did the CPAP minimize your DEEP and REM sleep. As you can see from just ones of my screens, I have very little of each. I have seen these numbers decrease since using the CPAP and wonder if there is any correlation.
Still waiting for the results of the Holter monitoring.

I track all my sleep data (total sleep, deep sleep, awake time) in Excel along with other things (if I exercised, had caffeine etc) to see how I can increase my deep sleep, which averages around 40 min.  I hadn't done it for about 10 days so I entered the data for those recent days, and I noticed that the previous data I had already recorded is now different.  It didn't all shift the same way, some are higher, some are lower.  I assume they updated the algorithm for how sleep is calculated, but I never saw any notification.  Does anyone have any more info?  I can't be sure how my sleep is changing long term or if new behaviors help/hurt my sleep if it's not being measured the same way.  It isn't as important to me how accurate it is as long as it's consistent, as I really just want to track how things are different from my mean. On a separate note, if I want to collect all this new data, is there a way to just export it all?  Up til now I've just manually entered it every day to every few days...
that is interesting
After a change of lifestyle, moving to a new house, new town, and so forth, I'm wondering if my sleep cycle has worsened because of that or because after 15+ years of sleeping on a waterbed and then a Sleep Number bed, for the past 2 years I have a regular mattress, and I toss and turn a lot now.  I knew before Fitbit that I'd wake up several times a night with my neck hurting or discomfort in arms or legs, so I change positions a lot.  And now monitoring my sleep with Fitbit, I have a lot more "restless sleep" and waking up in the cycle than I realized.  I had deep sleep for only 20 minutes out of 6 hours last night!  Since I have a hard time getting comfortable on the mattress (and it's a good Serta mattress, too!), changing positions all night, I'm wondering if it's the lifestyle change or the mattress.  Does anyone in the sleep topic have one of those sleep number beds?  Or a waterbed?
As someone who has been interested in deep sleep, I was pleased when Fitbit rolled out the sleep stages. Over the last few weeks, my deep sleep has plummeted, and I've tried a few things to improve it. One in particular has worked really well, that I'd like to share.
 
But first, what is deep sleep, and why is it important, especially to people engaging in fitness. Deep sleep is the most mysterious part of sleep, because we're not awake, we're not consciously dreaming. Really, there's not much going on at all, mentally. And that's important, to give us a break from thinking so we can process and integrate our experiences.In terms of physical health, deep sleep is critical. Potent hormones such a GH and IGF-1 are released during deep sleep. These hormones are linked to physical health as well as performance. When I don't get enough deep sleep, my strength workouts really suffer. Interestingly enough, getting a small amount of overall sleep affects me less than getting 8 hours of sleep, but very little deep sleep. That's how important it is.
I read a lot of articles and papers online about getting more deep sleep. But almost all of them were just generic advice on getting more and better sleep. They didn't focus on deep sleep itself, which is what I'm trying to improve. So I began experimenting...
 
Since deep sleep is a kind of oblivion (from the mind's perspective), there's no real conscious way to make it happen. While there are many tricks to falling asleep, or inducing dreams, the realm of deep sleep seems less traveled.So what's worked for me? First, is acknowledging I can't consciously put myself into deep sleep, because the very nature of deep sleep is unconscious. This may seem obvious, but it was an important realization to me. Because deep sleep occurs near the beginning of the sleep cycle, before REM, I feel the "getting to sleep" portion of the night is the most important aspect of getting deep sleep.Recently, when I can't sleep, I've taken to just getting out of bed, have some water, read a little. Just forget all about getting to sleep. Last night I went to sleep when ready, instead of when I should. I got less than 6 hours sleep, but my deep sleep was greatly increased. Today's workout I hit two personal records (squat and overhead press), and felt fine afterwards, despite not much sleep. It will be interesting to see the relationship between amount of overall sleep compared to deep sleep. For now, my experience says the amount of deep sleep is critical to physical performance.Would love to hear other's thoughts on the subject.Edit 2/24/2018:

There are some other suggestions for improving sleep on the pages linked below. I think there are a few that may be questionable as to their effectiveness. But what hasn't been mentioned much in this thread is the role of diet and gut health may play in promoting enough deep sleep. That being said, I feel as though the line can be blurred here between what's specifically helpful for deep sleep vs sleep in general (light and REM stages).

I think in various ways we’re all saying the same thing - mental stress. Getting 10k steps isn’t just about getting the steps, it’s about carving out that time for yourself. So is disconnecting from electronics. When I take care of my mental self, I get deep sleep. I barely got any exercise over Christmas, but my sleep was excellent because my anxiety was low. That’s going to be different for each of us, but I think the core of it is the same - making time toward the end of each day to spend time doing the thing that makes us happy. For me, it’s keeping my caffeine consumption low during the day and then reading a book before I fall asleep. For someone else, it’s digging in the dirt. But what I heard on this forum is a lot of anxiety and not a lot of time carved out of the day to take care of our inner selves. That’s the greatest treat we can give ourselves these days - the gift of time for ourselves. Maybe that sounds hokey, but that has been the biggest thing for me, more than what I eat or drink or if I use F.lux on my devices (I do). I know that’s easier said than done, but I hope my experience helps someone get better sleep tonight

I've read and heard from more than a few sources that getting to bed before 10pm is recommended
 
They say if you go to bed at 10am, you get the optimum sleep and recovery etc




Having a set routine is really critical for the body to know when to shut down and repair




 
Tools




Linking up the sleep stage monitoring so that the deep sleep enhancing sounds are played through a small speaker at the relevant periods so as to increase the effectiveness of the deep sleep in regenerating the body and mind
 
Since deep sleep occurs mostly at the beginning of sleep, I'm going to try falling asleep listening to some delta waves. You can use anything that will play music. If you search youtube for "delta wave sleep" or "binaural beats", there are lots of selections to choose from




Ear plugs




Using electronics at night definitely has an effect on sleep and deep sleep. I've used a freeware program on android and windows called F.lux. What it does is adjust the color spectrum of these devices to more naturally follow the changes of day and night. Since then, I picked up a pair of blue-blocking glasses, that I wear while watching TV at night. They work really well

I am trying a new supplement to help with falling asleep. It's called ZMA--and is zinc, magnesium and B6. I haven't changed any other aspect of sleep hygiene, to hopefully isolate the effect of ZMA. After two days of taking it at bedtime, my deep sleep % has gone from 10 to 18. Maybe someone else will get similar results?




 Try Prebiotica before you go to sleep. I saw this in a BBC documentary about sleep. It can push your deep sleep up about 9%




 
Various  




No alcohol (I only had about 2-4oz on occasion at night, but this really affected deep sleep), no screen time 2 hours before bed.  Stress also plays a big factor - I think it's actually the worse contributor to lack of deep sleep




I've made a few adjustments that seem to have increased my deep sleep time. 1. Shutting off the screens about 90 minutes before bed. 2. Drinking homemade "sleepy tea" with chamomile, valarian, lavender, hibiscus, red raspberry leaf and stevia. 3. Downloading the "Calm" app and doing at least a 5 minute meditation from their sleep options right before falling asleep. Also, having a routine that I am sticking to, which includes these things, plus writing a gratitude list and putting on on my humidifier/diffuser with lavender essential oil in it and reading if there's time. I managed to increase my deep sleep from about 8% to 16%, so something is working




I suffered from severe insomnia for most of my life.  Over the last 10 years I’ve been able to get that under control using various tricks, and I’m happy to see that my new Fitbit confirms that, averaging 1.5 hours of deep sleep.
I’m happy to share in case it can help someone else, but these are well known tricks.
- In bed by 10:30 most nights (my usual was midnight to 1am)
- No wine/juice caffeine in the evening on weekdays (after 4 for caffeine).
- No talking about work/problems after 8:00
- Enough physical activity during the day (I’m a bit of a couch potato, hence the new Fitbit! )
- No electronics after 9:30 (tv seems ok for me but it’s not in my bedroom)
- Eliminated sources of light in my bedroom (chargers, iphone, window)
- Up by 10 max on weekends to maintain a sleep pattern

Thanks Steve. Stupid me. I had my stride all wrong. Had 8.5cm instead of 85cm. Have decided to leave the default on as seemed accurate when I began.
Right now the sleep feature seems pretty broken across the board. Many people are reporting their sleep record is very wrong and has been for 4-5 days. My guess is fitbit is messing with that feature and that is why you aren't able to change anything in your profile. It would be nice if they would acknowledge it *sigh* but it's most likely not _you_ that is broken, but that aspect of the fitbit dashboard.
Any movement, if it makes you move, seems to be shown as restless. One lady posted on here that she knew when her dog jumped on the bed or her husband came home late by looking at her sleep log the next day. I have mine on sensitive and non-dominant.

@HelenaFitbit: where do you get the weekly report for sleep you posted? Or is this a Premium feature? Gee, average sleep of 2h45m, I really feel for you! This is my sleep last night

I called to let them know this is now night 5 where I didn't get detailed info and that my fitbit was still under warranty and I wanted one that worked. Apparently not everyone is experiencing the same thing. Some people are still getting all the info while many of us are not. They sent me an email saying their engineers are doing all they can to solve this as soon as possible. In the meantime we have to suffer without our data.

My average sleep score was only 77 this week. Usually it's in the upper 80s. I'm not sure what went wrong. I'm going to try turning off all screens at 8 pm and see if that helps. Sometimes, I get in the habit of scrolling and scrolling on social media in the evening. That's not a helpful thing to do.

I agree: I miss all the information that is no longer available. Frankly,the most important aspect of my Fitbit was the sleep data that's no longeravailable. (I have a sleep disorder plus sleep apnea.)This seems to be an example of "progress" marching on ;-).
@mary59 Do you mean that it goes to sleep as in the screen turns off or that it starts the sleep activity mode?

	One cannot get wet by the word water; they'd need to touch the water. One cannot get fit by merely thinking about exercise; they'd need to get up and do something.
To put in/out sleep mode, you must keep tapping until the device vibrates. Two times is not necessarily enough. Two times is what prompts the progress readout.
Yes, I understand, however I am asking how this information translates into hypnograms so that I can see how many stages I hit on average. People can vary as is shown in my original post. Can you help with that?
Hello! I use the FitBit Flex.I am currently using it to track my sleep pattern. I haven't been wearing it during the day.
Well, I find your issue to be valid for the display on my Alta lights up pretty brightly, and when your brain is in the sleep mode, it's quite harsh on the eye. Your suggestion for the lights to switch on only when pressing a button might hold for certain Fitbit devices - the Alta has no such button. This indirectly correlates to a thread in the help forum on having the option to choose the duration of display. My problem is that when working out, you require to keep an eye on the minutes/seconds display - once I tap the display on, Alta lights stay on for mere 3 seconds. So while the Fitbit provides the watch feature, it's of no use if i can't track time. What would be useful for users is for the display to be provided as option to check on (and for what duration), and switch off with say a button, say like how we use our phones. As for your predicament, perhaps you can post the suggestion for a 'full feature' display being off when sleep mode is on. All product feature suggestions are tagged with a status, whether under consideration, in the works, etc. Alternatively, how about a cover for display screens - dunno of such things are already out there in the market. I rely too heavily on my silent alarms so cannot go without my band at night, but if the lights were to bother me that much, I guess I could try covering it with a wrist band or sorts.  Gosh, sometimes I miss the good old Flex with its simple five dots and nothing else. It would track all info for me to check when I need to on the phone!
Hey, My force has a whole week of sleep log missing - also, whatever I enter manually to check if there was any movement (basically to try to guess when I went to sleep/wok up), it thinks that I was fully asleep - no movement whatsoever (th whole week). And it's strange that my logged start/end sleep times were not logged also. Basically everything from March 23 to March 30 is blank. I have not taken off my Force during that time for sure (only to charge it). What could be the problem? And would it be possible to restore the data? Or at least make sure it does not happen again. Sarunas
Breath rate on my Charge 5 has never worked since I got it about 3 weeks ago. Fitbit Support had me try all sorts of things and in the end admitted it is a "known issue".  That really irritates me that they continue to market that the Charge 5 has breath rate capability when it does not.  False advertising.  They need to issue a statement that this metric is not provided by Charge 5..
Mine fluctuates between anything from 5-20x restless. I find that when I've been out on a hike or a long walk I sleep so much better than after a gym session. Everyone is different but I find the outdoors really works for me!
10 hr 59 🙂
I do not see much deep + rem activity in my FitBit.I am starting to suspect that the fact that I am using a CPAP mask results in FitBit missing deep sleep & rem recognition. Have any other CPAP users seen this lack of deep & rem sleep?Do you think that there is something wrong with the FitBit sleep algorithms for people who use CPAP? Example:Last night I went to bed at 11:45 PM and woke up briefly 3 - 4 times and woke up at 9:10 AM.In the morning I woke up feeling as if I had gotten a good night's sleep.FitBit Premium said I had 7 hr 27 min sleep.Deep sleep = 9 minutesRem = 19 minutes.Light sleep = 6 hr 59 minutes. I am fairly certain I had more rem sleep since I woke up during the night remembering dreams. That typically happens at the end of REM. I also think that I had more than 9 minutes of deep sleep based on the fact that I felt rested after waking up. I am 77 years old in reasonable health.I use a Versa 2. I have a FitBit Premium subscription.My CPAP machine is a Phillips Respironics with a Dreamwear mask.Last night the CPAP said I had an AHI of 5.4. That means that the CPAP is working well.
I only know how to do this from a computer. Go to your dashboard, look on the left side there is a circle with 9 small squares in a circle. Click this and it will show you tile options to add to your dashboard. Maybe your tile got accidentally moved over to there?
Black or dark curtains work really well.  I like to tape mine around the edges to make sure no light gets in at all.Also, I like to make it cooler in my room via a fan or air conditioner.  Getting cozy under a nice blanket helps me out a lot.  There are over the counter medications you can try if you are really struggling on a given day.  Any product with diphenhydramine (benadryl) will make you tired if you take it 1 hr before bedtime.  Sleep at the same time of day.  If 10 30 am is your bedtime for instance, make it your bedtime daily.
@SantiR I think they helped him get better quality sleep.
I, too, have been diagnosed with sleep apnea.  While anybody might have it, it's more common for those of us who are overweight (well, who isn't, these days.:D ).  The Dr. says loose weight and in my case, he's right.  The Flex just proves it -- though not as accurately as a medically certified sleep study.
Same here...only not on my computer
Thanks for your feedback Yojana.  It’s interesting to learn that doctors have observed this comdition.  Kind regards.
Hi @writergal28 I'm sorry to hear you are having an issue tracking your sleep. Will you please share  few more details. For example, do you see % of Awake, Light, & Deep? If you see those three, if the REM at 0% or not displayed at all? If you aren't seeing any of those, how long are you sleeping? If you aren't sleeping more than 3 hours, that data won't be available. With a bit more information, I'm hope we can solve this issue for you. Best of luck!

@brooksy1985Click on your sleep tiles RH arrow, hover your mouse over the sleep record, click the edit pencil and at the bottom of the record is the Sensitivity setting. That just changes that record. If you feel you need that to be permanent for awhile, click on your settings gear wheel near your profile picture and change it there.

I've achieved over 90 one time since it was implemented.  For reference, I don't set any alarm, so my wake up is "natural".  The single 91 I scored was after a night where I got 8 hours 19 minutes restful sleep (9 hours and 8 minutes total sleep). My actual average restful is between 6h30m and 7h15m.  I generally score between 80 and 84.  I'm totally fine with that, but the stupid scoring implies I could sleep 15-20% better each night, which doesn't seem possible, as the score seems to value time spent restful sleeping the most, and no way will I ever be able to achieve over 8 hours restful regularly (meaning likely over 9 total) - nor would I want to. However, I've given up on the score being useful just today.  I've been working on my poor posture lately, and may have overdid it a bit on Sunday - as yesterday I had a bit more back pain that usual (it's gradually going down, but some days I maybe exercise a bit too much or sit poorly a bit too much, still).  My restful sleep when I woke up this morning checked in at 4h51m (I was up later than usual as I was just uncomfortable) and my total was only 5h13m.  I felt like hot trash, and needed a 90 minute nap about 4 hours later.  However I was scored at an 80 - which is simply laughable. I've only had one other night with such poor sleep since the score came into being, and it was rightly scored much lower (66 - though I would have rated it lower), and so many much better nights of sleep scored in the 70's. I don't see the point of the Sleep Score at all.  In my 48 years I've never slept as much as it seems to indicate I need to in order to get an excellent night's sleep, and have no need nor desire to start now.  And when it scores bad nights as "good", it's number becomes useless.
I _*CAN*_ set the sleep tracker-- where did that subject line come from?  I just want to know how to get better sleep-- otherwise, what's the point in tracking it?
Hello, Tks for your reply!!The problem was that I used the Begin Sleep Now option.Now, I am not using this option and it is working!!! Regards,Tiago Facchin
Can you elaborate on exactly how to create a custom activity ? I presume it would start and stop at the sleep times but I'm not sure how to create it.
Love the singing in the head might try that , as I get very restless at night thankyou 🙂
I’m having the same issue. Apparently I was awake for 2 hours last night.
About meI have fitbit flex for about two months. Until last week, I was able to see the time to fall asleep on dashboard and application. This week, it shows nothing on the app and the dashboard it is shown as zero. I didnot change anything. Do you have any idea how to fix it or what I might be missing?
If your seeing basic sleep data @murphbhbl it is not because Fitbit has taken it away. We have an issue probably with the tracker. What does the app say about not seeing sleep data?
Hello @Mindraid, welcome to the community forums! 
 
Charge 3 supports Smart Wake. When setting an alarm, turn on Smart Wake. This allows your tracker to find the best time to wake you starting 30 minutes before the alarm time you set. It avoids waking you during deep sleep so you're more likely to wake up feeling refreshed. If Smart Wake can't find the best time to wake you, your alarm alerts you at the set time. 
 
In addition, devices like the Versa 3 and Sense also support Smart Wake. For more information, please check: 
How do I manage alarms on my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps!

See this help section:What should I know about sleep stages?particularly the section "What does each stage mean?" Different stages have different purposes. Greatly simplified, deep sleep is for the body, REM sleep is for the mind. Thinking of food, your question is something like, which is better 10 grams of fiber or 20 grams of protein?  There's no answer - you need them both.

I used to grind a lot, but now I mostly clench.  I went through a night guard from the dentist that lasted 4 years, but I use OTC ones now that do okay.  I find that when I am really sleeping well (and not constantly restless like I am lately) that I do not clench as much at night.  I also clench all day long and have headaches almost every day.  I have to constantly remind myself to stop! It's a pain!
Keep in mind that sleep is always credited to the day you wake up.  So if you go to bed at 9 PM, wake up at 11 PM, then get back to sleep, that 9-11 sleep will get credited to that previous day, not the same day as when you wake up in the morning.

As no one replied to this, I opened a Fitbit Support Chat window, but that is waiting for 12 hours or longer...
I start it as I'm actually laying down, relaxing, getting ready to fall asleep.
My REM is consistenly below the benchmark as well. Let me know if you find out anything.
Are you using a Flex or a One?  Either way, you could try resetting your device from scratch, or else go into the Settings menu on the web site dashboard and try changing it from Standard to Sensitive, or vice versa.  It could also be the device is getting "tapped" rapidly at night for some reason and turning itself off after you set it.  I noticed if I shake my hands pretty hard (I wear the Flex) it will sometimes automatically activate the sleep mode (hence it could be shut off the same way, but I'm pretty sure you would notice unless you are sleepwalking).
Hello!  New to the community, not new to fitbit.  
I am working on increasing my sleep and love the tips around here.

Hi! I also just got the fitbit charger 2 and never had used a tracker before. I thought this would be great because it tracks your sleep. However, I did notice that I feel anxious and tense, while my eyes move around slightly rapidly with my eyelids closed. I end up having to take it off and tuck it away under my other pillow. Right after, my body instantly becomes relaxed and I am able to go to sleep soundly. I notice other people state that it's a mental state, but it just seems odd and I feel if I'm tired enough I wouldn't consciously feel that I have it on. I don't have the bluetooth or location settings on my phone so I know it's not that. It would be great to know what others have felt and done to try to stop the lack of sleep.
Hello @klsdad, welcome to the community forums! Thanks for taking the time to share your experience! 😁
 
There are several steps you can take to increase your chances for getting great sleep results. The National Sleep Foundation suggests sticking to a sleep schedule, avoiding naps in the afternoon, practicing a relaxing bedtime routine, and exercising daily among other recommendations.
 
Additionally, Fitbit offers several tools to help you sleep better. You can set a sleep schedule in the Fitbit app to help you maintain a more consistent pattern of sleep. You can also learn about your sleep habits through sleep insights and set a bedtime reminder in the Fitbit app to help you wind down for sleep each night. For more information, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
For more information on sleep stages, see our blog posts REM, Light, Deep: How Much of Each Stage of Sleep Are You Getting? and Your Heart Rate Is the Key to Smarter Sleep Stages. Here’s Why. For additional sleep information including tips for feeling rested, visit the Fitbit blog.
 
Let's see if other users can share their experiences and any other insights or suggestions 😊

Hi @Victamon This excerpt from What should I know about Fitbit Sleep Stages explains how your Fitbit device determines if you're asleep: Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep.I believe you get a sleep score when your Fitbit records about 3 hours of sleep. If it recorded you being in REM/light sleep and decent Restoration during that time,  you could get a score around 65 since it calculates those as percentages of your sleep. I haven't read anything so far that suggests your sleep score is weighted by the previous days' scores. Like you, I have had nights where I know I was asleep but it wasn't recorded by my Fitbit. I've also had times when my tracker recorded me as asleep when I've been reading a book or playing games on my tablet. Although I know that I can edit the sleep log, I don't bother except to remove the erroneous extended sleep in the morning. On most days, I wake up before I'm ready to get up, then lay in bed not moving much, which gets recorded as REM or light sleep. Knowing that I can "fool" my Fitbit so it records me as sleeping, I consider the sleep data as interesting but don't rely on it to be extremely accurate. The most important thing is that you feel refreshed and rested after your sleep.

Hi there, I have recently gone into the next age range of 50-59 so am getting benchmarks for that range. But I want to see how it compares with the benchmark of mid/late 40's.Does anyone know what the %'s are for women please, can't seem to find that info anywhere!

Okay I have the Flex so right before I fall alseep I tap it about 5 times, right on the light bar. It vibrates and two lights come up (they remind me of eyeballs). I can double check to see if I am in sleep mode by double tapping- the eyes come on. Then when I wake up I tap again rapidly- like 5 or 6 times, it vibrates and all 5 lights come on, then the one light to show I am ready to count my steps. I don't enter anything in my log. The night I forgot to set my Flex I had no sleep recorded so I went into my log and entered the time I fell alseep and when I woke up. It recorded the sleep just fine. It sounds like you are trying to double do it- it says you entered sleep and don't need to again. Is that possible? For the other devices see here: https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/176101-how-do-i-track-my-sleep- Hope this helps!
Hi there,I rely heavily on my weekly sleep average on the Fitbit app and as a practicing physician I even tell my patients to use this score to help guide their choices... Basically, I know that for optimal health I need 7hrs 30 min a night, so I use the app to help me craft my sleep schedule to achieve that by the end of the week. Without that metric, it is much more difficult to figure it out and I have to do the math myself.  I just opened the app and weekly sleep average is gone and replaced with this strange sleep score which is really unhelpful. How do I get average sleep per week back? I have no idea why they would get rid of this. I really don't like the new app at all. If any one knows how to get average sleep number back, please let me know!

It's pretty simple actually.  You probably did it right but it just slipped out.  There is a slit in the band that the fitbit One slips into which is the opening for a small pocket with a see-thru piece of fabric that allows you to access your fitbit One while it's in the little pocket.  I turn the One to face my wrist ever since my wrist was next to my face and text popped up on the One and shown on my eyelid and woke me up.  lolBut, once you slip the One in the little opening and you can see it in the little pocket of the wrist band then your done.  It has fallen out on me but only once.
Thank you! I'll do that!
We've completely resolved the issue earlier this month that was causing users to not see Sleep Stages. If anyone still does not see Sleep Stages, I can confirm that it has nothing to do with that temporary outage.
 
I'd recommend checking this help article to better understand the most common reasons that Sleep Stages might not appear on your account.
All that is important is that you are completely relaxed and comfortable.  On the news this morning they said the perfect amount of sleep was 7 hours.  They said 5 hours at night and a 2 hour nap works too.   More or less isn't as good.  If you accept as true that sleep is not even important it takes off all the pressure.  Some say that side sleeping is best so you might want a pillow on each side from waist down to rest your top leg on.  Another pillow chest high could be good for your top arm.  a small square pillow about as wide as your shoulder that doesn't squash might be good to consider.   A recording of rain to listen to might keep you from thinking of solving problems.  Take the pressure off; sleep isn't important.
Agreed. The Average Sleep was one of the best features of Fitbit. This new Sleep score is ridiculous and not at all helpful. We do t want it so get rid please and bring back the Average Sleep.
"How to calculate sleep efficiency from record provided by Dashboard?" I am in the same boat. It seems to be implied that there is a sleep-score that is displayed somewhere. It is easy enough to calculate out the fitbit fomula of what time FitBit says I was asleep - the time I went to bed to get that number of minutes. My average in-bed time is about 5.5. hours. It takes about 10 minutes for me to go to sleep. If I divide that 10 mins. by the remaining 320 minutes (5 hrs and 20 minutes,) , I get 10/320 = 3% inefficiency and 97% efficient sleep.  I'd love to make this more complicated (I do this a lot in life!)What if used my total awake time from fitbit instead?  According to FitBit, my average awake time is 13% - 48 minutes a night. While this is within the average range for FitBit users of my gender and age, I do not believe I spend that much time at night awake. This leads me to believe that the FitBit sleep algorithm does not fit me well.

I'd like your thoughts on how accurate the sleep measurements are.  There are days that I feel like I slept terribly and have a sleep score in the 80s and times I feel like I slept great and have a sleep score in the 70s.  I'm very skeptical about data that fitness monitors collect, yet I still wear my Fitbit religiously.  Thanks!
My tracker shows that I sleep for a couple hours, then will have no tracking for 2-3 hours --as if I'm up. then tracks sleep for the next few hours. For example, sleep from 11:15-1.  Nothing from 1-3:20. Then sleep 3:20-7:30.  I can imagine I might be sleeping light, but can't imagine I'm so awake it isn't tracking me but I have no knowledge.  My sleep tracker sensitivity is set at "normal."  Any thoughts?
Changing the setting from Normal to Sensitive didn't fix the problem. All it did was indicate the many periods when it detected I was restless. It suggested that I got only 3 hr 30 min sleep last night between 11:52am and 7:27am. Incredible!   And that's it folks. Looks like these devices last only a year. It was the sleep function that I particularly appreciated. Back to wearing my old, very reliable $50 watch that doesn't need to be constantly recharged and on which I can also read the time outdoors in daylight. Now that's almost a consolation prize!
Yes, thank you Marci.Best wishes,Ron Melka
Hopefully this is not bullcrap as it's taken from the fitbit help file for sleep tracking: "WHY DON'T I SEE SLEEP STAGES TODAY?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your tracker from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your tracker higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your tracker to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your tracker’s battery is critically low."taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163
What is heart math or edmr? I believe exercise can reduce stress and help.My restless leg syndrome actually improved almost to 100% when I went offan antidepressant I was on along with a medication that is used for RLS. Asit turned this medication that is used to help Restless legs, also causesthis as a side effect in some people. The difference is crazy, and I at onepoint tried to go back on the antidepressant and my RLS came back that verynight. I have lost my Fitbit, so I'd love to know what my patterns looklike now, but I am not longer falling asleep at the wheel of life so I'mvery pleased with it. Now I use exercise to combat the anxiety and it worksbetter without the unwanted side effects. I am lucky in a way, but yeah,you gotta work for the prize, it's an effort to motivate to get up and gobut worth it tenfold! Thanks for sharing 😁
To be added to the benchmark section on sleep
Here is what sleep tracking looks like with the new Charge and the One, for the same sample night: Charge:One: With both trackers, I've been using Normal for Sensitivity to movements. Based on that one sample night, the One appears to be slightly more sensitive than the Charge (detected more times being awakened). I posted another comparison (steps, calories, VAMs, floors) in this thread.

I take it everyone uses sensitive tracker ? When I use this mode, I get between 55% an 65%... I take it I should be worried about that ?
I would have your vitamin D level checked.
Hi guys!  Any clue what could cause my sleeping heart rate to be higher then my resting heart rate?  I have an above resting heart rate most nights
What happened to sleep score?  It went away from the Android and Iphone APPs 11/12/19 and never  came back.  Does not even come with premium which I am about to cancel
There seems to be conflicting information on sleep score depending on where one looks. would be great to have a statement from fitbit clarifying
Was this issue ever solved? It happens to me even when the battery is at 100%.
Hey Shelley, Nice name BTW. I just started using a fitbit (flex) and set mine to sensitive at night as well. I think it just tracks how many times you are awake - this might be based on movement, might be based on something else. My guess is most likely movement (toss, turn) as when I'm awake (and I know it) I usually lie still and go through my breathing and graditude exercises and it's showing me as a very high efficiency (90+).  It might sound really simple, but my night routine includes some quiet time thinking of all things that I appreciate and am grateful in my life (could be even the fact that I have a bed and covers). Try that before you go to sleep and let me know how it goes. I have some others to help with sleep that I'll share as I discover this community.
My sleep/awake, hours/minutes is showing the same on the main screen for every prior day when I go look at what I did days before. It's showing what was recorded the last night I slept on all screens. So if I go back several days to see my results, nothing changes except the calories, steps, etc at the top. Nothing below that changes. Steps per each hour does not change either. Any suggestions? I have not updated to the new version yet. Thanks!
Just got mine a week ago and i am tired alot but what is acceptable amount of reatless sleep. And a acceptable ampunt of reatleaa/wake minute?
thats the same one I use, its really a good value and very good tasting one and dissolves quickly 😚
If it's set on normal , you will have great sleep patterns of a healthy person. Set on sensitive, you will look like an insomniac that needs medical help. The same is true for the activity trsacking. If I mow my lawn, the vibration from the mower makes it look like I walked 12 miles. readings from this need to be taken with a grain of salt. People get obcessed with the data , but , need to keep a level of common sense.
Just got a Charge 3 a week ago - I got a sleep score on the first night but no joy since with either a server did not allow log to be saved message or only random hour or two being recorded as sleep through out the night (and it doesn't seem to matter if I use the app to 'go to sleep and wake up' or just let it work it out based on my goal times). Of course editing to log the actual hours over the random hours it did record means you lose the little data that is there. The only things I read about sensitivity and everything so far is about changing settings from sensitive to normal, however it is on normal and will try sensitive tonight. If that doesn't work then we're back to the store for an exchange since sleep tracking is very important to me.  ***update***changed sensitivity to sensitiveAs found and suggested somewhere, turned watch so face is on inside instead of outside of wristlogged going to bed and awake in the app on phone sitting next to the bedAnother useless 'couldn't save log to servers' message. verified phone app is up to date. manual synch of phone/watch7 days and ONE sleep log. I'm in bed from 10:30pm to 06:45 each day and my app reports:day 1 - Mon 6:51Tues - 6:32Wed - no hoursThurs 1 hour and then another 1 hour 20 minutesFri - 5:39Sat - 2 hours 2 mintoday - 2 hours 51 minutes7uyyy -->I know I'm not getting great sleep and that's a very big reason I bought this Charge 3 - but suggesting I'm getting on average 4 hours 23 minutes per night? I wouldn't be able to survive!- yes, I can and do go in and edit by hand, but if I have to do that, why wouldn't I buy a pencil and notebook and save myself $165?
I have been reading some fitbit users with sleep concerns. I only average 3.32 hours of sleep per night and feel fine (only 2% get less sleep than me). I have often been made to feel bad by others because I do not sleep much - as if I am some kind of deviant or criminal. The reality is I feel fine. I am not tired throughout the day, my mind is clear ( I am currently working on my Masters with a 4.0 GPA). Not everyone needs a great deal of sleep.
Hi @belindaesq, Yes, this is a known issue that is currently being worked on (assuming you're talking about sleep stages). If you subscribe to this thread, you'll get notification as soon as it's fixed. From what I've seen, it's not a problem with individual fitbit devices, so getting another unit probably wouldn't have any effect.

Nevermind, I went back to my dashboard and roamed around with the sleep tile and found it.
I just started using a Charge4, mostly because I wanted to work on getting better sleep.  I'm disappointed by the data available.  
 
Do I need to pay for a Premium subscription to see the HRV and heart rate during the night, rather than just a single data point?  Similarly, do I need to pay for Premium to track functions past 1 week?  It is difficult to spot trends looking at only a week of data.
 
This is very disappointing, as it makes the Fitbit products much less useful and much less value than I had originally anticipated.

Hello everyone! 
 
How's everything going? 🤗
 
Have you heard about Narcolepsy before? Narcolepsy is considered a neurological >nervous system< disorder that affects the brain’s ability to control sleep and wakefulness. 
 
If you have narcolepsy, you experience excessive daytime sleepiness and may have uncontrollable episodes of falling asleep during the daytime. These sudden sleep “attacks” may occur during any type of activity and at any time of the day.
 
Symptoms of narcolepsy include:
 
Disrupted nighttime sleep: this symptom is described as frequent awakenings during the night. 
 
Automatic behavior: this symptom is described as falling asleep for several seconds but continues to perform routine tasks, such as eating, talking, driving or writing, without any awareness or later memory of ever doing the task. 
 
Excessive daytime sleepiness: All patients with narcolepsy have this symptom. In general, this interferes with normal activities like work, school, home life, social activities every day. Although brief naps during the day may help you feel rested and alert, tiredness returns within one to two hours. People with this report mental cloudiness, a lack of energy and concentration, memory lapses, a depressed mood and/or extreme exhaustion.
 
Sleep paralysis: this symptom is the inability to move or speak just before falling asleep or just after waking up. Episodes of sleep paralysis usually go away after a few seconds to a few minutes.
 
Here Are Some Tips To Stay Awake With Narcolepsy: 
 
Rest Best at Night: 

Relax before turning in. Avoid alcohol close to bedtime.
Try to go to bed at the same time each night.
If you wake up during the night, avoid reaching for your phone or other electronics. Screens stimulate, not relax, you.

Watch Your Carbs: Some people feel drowsy after a big meal. That can be especially true if you have narcolepsy. Limit sugar and other carbs to stay more alert. Eat smaller meals and snack on nuts, berries, and other nutritious foods in between.
 
Move around: walk around every 20 minutes or so to stay alert. If you work at a desk, get up and visit the break room.
 

Stand up when you read emails and texts.
Walk to the bathroom even if you don’t need to go.
Pace while talking on the phone.

Keep Cool: cold feet may help keep you awake. One study found that people with narcolepsy tend to have warmer skin temperatures in their fingers and toes. Cooler hands and feet made the people in the study more alert. You can dial down your body warmth with special cooling clothing, by avoiding warm drinks or meals, or using fans to keep your hands and feet chilled.
 
Exercise: physical activity ramps up your metabolism but also may help you rest better at night. Find something you can enjoy and stick with at least 20 minutes per day. Think tai chi, dancing, weight training, gardening, swimming, or tennis. Finish your workouts at least 3 hours before bedtime so you can wind down for restful slumber.  
 
Schedule Naps: try to take several cat naps of about 15-20 minutes every day. But cap your dozes to no more than 30 minutes.
 

 
These are just a few tips that can help with Narcolepsy. I wonder if anyone else has more tips or more information about this topic. It'd be great to see and read comments about it 😴😊
 
Have a wonderful day!

Hey @momo43, hope you're doing great! You have a good insight here, since I've noticed that a common cause of a rising heart rate during sleep is a lack of oxygen, which is often brought on by obstructive sleep apnea. This is a condition where a person's normal breathing frequency is reduced or sometimes flat-out stopped during sleep. Are you taking medication before going to bed? This might be another reason.

Okay, maybe my 10-20x isn't so crazy then. I'll definitely have to look at it more when I've been running or hiking outside. I've also seen more stresfful days definitely more restlessness (that's a given I think).

I gave up on the velcro band and just bought one of those wrist sweatbands with a zipper pouch they make for holding small items while you work out. It holds my fitbit, doesn't slip off, and is far more comfortable than the stupid velcro strap ever was.
I know I'm a light sleeper but, I've never had this before 😲
I used to have stomach aches and about 6 months ago I started a much healthier eating program.  It is from the Maximized Living program that my chiropracter promotes.  I quit eating sugar and carbs.  The only carbs I eat are from real food (green apples, berries and veggies).  I use coconut oil, olive oil and butter and only grass fed beef, organic chicken etc.  6 months later and I have no headaches, no brain fog, and feel much better.  (gave up soft drinks too and only use stevia to sweeten).  I have recently been tested and do have some heavy metals in my system (lead) so I will start a detox after the 4th of July.  I did lose about 20 pounds and it was not hard.  I allow myself to cheat when going to social events but very sparingly. I got my fitbit for Mothers Day and love it.  I average over 10,000 steps but do have to work at it since my job is mostly at a desk.  I use my tredmill before going to work and then it is usually pretty easy.
I have it set to normal
Hi @Ray94903 I have been taking Olly Sleep Gummies. One serving has 3mg of melatonin which seems to work well for me 🙂
It was hard for me to fall asleep for a long time. And when I had a success I saw terrible nightmares which made me scream and sweat.  To say nothing about the rest quality I had. And One thing helped me was a guided hypnosis. Despite all the scepticism I had, it helped a lot. Here's the link for those who suffer as I did https://sleephypnopill.com/have_sweet_dreams/
Thx for this post, I am in the same boat. Have been through several smart watches discovering various levels og insufficient deep sleep levels and now just started using fitbit.

I was wondering this too, which is how I found this thread.  Being a new fitbit user, what I have noticed is that googling stuff often links to these fitbit community thread, and many of them are left unsolved.  What is also concerning is that many of the moderator/staff replies miss the point of the question and are often less informed that some of the user replies.
Thanks a lot. And yes I agree late meals really make a difference specially when ingested late or closer to bed time (I can see the different patterns and connect with root cause).I got quite a structured routine daily (no medication, no alcohol). My last meal is no later than 7pm and tends to be on the light side, compared different meals and seen no difference. Then 4 or 5 times a week I work out from 8:15pm to 9:45pm and have a protein shake right after, bed time around 10:45pm. I would say that this routine repeats everyday (except Tuesday, Friday and Saturday - rest days). But the patterns are somehow different and that is definitely something that interests me :). Some days look the same in terms of meals and routine and show a completely different sleeping pattern still didn't figured out why.
thx!!  seems to have been the only time................so far lol!
I hear you--fall a sleep sleep maybe an hour hour and a half wake up.  back to sleep awake in a half hour then back to sleep then maybe somewhere around morning a stretch of another hours sleep ---whee --- lucky me ---I am so refreshed  NOT
@Soccerlove12 wrote:I got 8 hrs and 36 minutes of sleep last night and my Fitbit told me I only woke up once and was restless 11 times for a minute or so... WHY am I still exhausted when I wake up?Depends on what you were doing during that 11 minutes 🙂 Seriously though, if you sleep with a light on - it will effect you (see "blue light" studies).Also, stress (physical or mental) will cause one to feel tired - and some people just needmore sleep. Depending on the person and age, anything from 6 to 10 hours is "normal".
Is 90% below resting heart rate good with 55 avg bom and 10% above resting heart rate?I am not able to understand this .
On my mobile app.  I tried to figure it out. If there was a reason for the different graph.   Thinking maybe less sleep or more sleep, but there wasn't a pattern. The bar graph is just one shot that says "sleep pattern".  The wavy line graph is called "sleep pattern", and you can progress through individual pages that highlight awake, REM, Light, and deep percentages. I started with Charge 3 about a month ago.  got only wavy for a week. Next week, 3 bar graphs. Next week 4. This week 2 out of 3 nights.

As a Retired Respiratory Therapist and Sleep Tech, I question how could it be possible to determine an accurate REM?
 
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Hi Daysslikethese, My sleep pattern is similar. Lots of tossing and turning. I am a light sleeper. It seems as if the fitbit reads tossing and turning as times awake. I have been referred to a sleep clinic by my doctor. Will see if it helps.
Yes I have a blank graph. But I have a Blaze.
Called Support yesterday (9/8/2017); they said yes this is a known problem. They will be rolling out a fix soon, but they could not say when. So it is not yet resolved. I would encourage people to keep calling/messaging Fitbit, so they know the extent of the problem. Keeping the priority high.
Go in and edit your awake time in the app and see if it calculates better.  Occasionally I have this issue.
My sleeping HR is often higher than my resting HR for a large percentage of the night. I've also been waking up shivering and sweating or just soaked in sweat in the morning. My sleep isn't generally disturbed and I don't dream much, once I'm asleep I'm asleep. Is this normal or a possible issue? I'm 31, if that matters.
Can anyone tell me why my heart rate dips from 69-71 (sleeping heart rate) down to 52-55 for 20 minutes than back up to the 69-71 onward? It seems to only happen on nights, when I only have 4-6 hours of sleep.
Good morning. Go under "Log tab" on a computer. Scroll down to where the 2 broken up logs are for the night. Delete the one from 10:30-1:26am. (Trust me) Then go to the other sleep pattern from 1:27-6:00am and click edit. Look at the time and change the start to 10:30pm. Click save. It will then put the one you deleted at the beginning of this sleep log. Hope this helps.
Sleep log accurately logs sleep but a few days later the data changes in the log. Thinking I met my goals for a long stretch of days and status indicates I met my goal- then I look at logs over the week and sporadic days are far below (when I definitely met it!) Buggy!!
If I'm understanding the question correctly - you're looking at http://www.fitbit.com/sleep and comparing the charts on the right.
 
There are four graphs - the top two of which display "Time asleep" and "Time awoken", while the bottom two display "Total time asleep" and "Total time awoken".
 
The top two are meant to display the information for the single largest sleep session of the day, which is going to be the night's sleep time for most users. The bottom two will display this same data, and will also include any additional sleep logs from that day (naps or short sleep sessions that supplemented your night's rest).
 
If you only log one sleep session each day, these graphs will always look the same. Hopefully that clears things up - let me know if I can answer anything else.

From my charge 2 to the ionic both watches never recorded my sleep time automatically until I came up with my own opinion if you move a lot in bed while sleeping the phone won't record right both of my watches were recording only 45 minutes to 1 hour and a half never a full night sleep I guess I wasted $450.00 on 2 pieces of junk.
I have found by wearing the unit at my waist during the night rather than on my wrist, the increments now show up as varied providing perhaps a more accurate (?) recording of the night.  Find it interesting too how the report on my iPhone shows awake, restless and sleep as opposed to the online reports which show only if you're either awake or asleep. I have found the other reports– steps, floors, etc. to be right on the mark but can see short of being wired up, the short comings of a device which measures movement attempting to determine states of sleep, restlessness or wakefulness.
I experienced the same on all my Fitbit trackers (1,Flex,Charge2). I find this quite annoying although the sleep recording might not always be accurate. However, it was always at least an indicator of your sleep quality in the night. In my opinion it should be made available again.

Using electronics at night definitely has an effect on sleep and deep sleep. I've used a freeware program on android and windows called F.lux. What it does is adjust the color spectrum of these devices to more naturally follow the changes of day and night. Since then, I picked up a pair of blue-blocking glasses, that I wear while watching TV at night.

It's showing that I slept for 9 hours and 22 minutes on Sunday night... So why is it showing as 18 HOURS on my chart?Am I missing something glaringly obvious here?
I showed my neurologist the stats for sleep as I purchased the premium package as sleep for a narcoleptic is crucial. The sensitive setting I used seems to fall in line with sleep testings I've had done.

I'm having the exact same problem with my charge 5; it's already set to "sensitive sleep" and it tells me I should be refreshed and renewed, I feel as refreshed as if an 18 wheeler ran me over. Is there any help on the way?
I have the same problem with the Fitbit Android app / Fitbit Charge 3, sleep log is registering sleep and wake-up time 1 hour earlier. Also the Last Sync Time is always showing "Synced 1 hour ago" immediately after a Sync. I also noticed that the step counter resets itself around 1:00 (AM) instead of 0:00 (AM) resulting in duplicate goal completion notifications just after 0:00 (AM).
Hi @YaelYael, this article on the difference between normal and sensititve sleep modes may help you to understand your sleep log a little better. Hope this helps!

Why is it sometimes a bar graph, and other times a wavy line graph showing stages? I have a charge 3.
For clarity, you say that when you use the CPAP your Sleep Scores go down?
Hi @WilsonFitbit Foods that have helped me are poultry, eggs, cheese and bananas.
I was getting low readings, averaging 85-88 per night.  I was getting anxious and spoke to my doctor about this but he was not overly concerned since it was a wrist reading and many things can interfere with an accurate reading.  His advice (which seems to have worked) helped and my readings are 93-96 overnight.His advice was since we tend to wear our watch nonstop with showers, exercise, cooking, cleaning, etc it is important to ensure any particles on the wrist and watch are cleaned and not interfering with the sensor:Ensure the sensor does not have any dirt, dust, or other particle on it.  Just before bed wash your wrist and wipe the sensor area of the watch.  Lotions, dust, and other particles transferred from our skin or from normal wear can create an interference of the sensor light.  Even natural oils from our skin need to be wiped off the back of the watch or if we shower with it, water that dries on the sensor can leave a "haze" (think dried water on a window type spot).   I started to clean my wrist where the sensor meets the skin with an astrigent cleaner or alcohol right before bed and will wipe down the back of my watch with a clean cloth (almost like polishing) and it really has helped to get a more accurate reading.  It has only been +/- 1 or 2 numbers off now instead of 10.
yer mine did that but the other day it said the servers were down so i was thinking it might have been a blip
@forcr There are two sets of graphs on your Sleep Page at https://www.fitbit.com/sleep.
 
The top two, labeled "Time asleep" and "Times awoken", include only your night's sleep.
 
The bottom two, labeled "Total time asleep" and "Total times awoken", include your night's sleep, as well as any naps you might log during the day.
 
So if you don't log anything aside from a single sleep log for the night, these two sets will be identical. If you log additional sleep logs outside of your night's rest, the bottom graph will include them. I hope that clears things up!
Great question.  I would like an answer too!

While I have limited experience I can tell you that my Surge doesn't require any action on my part to record sleep patterns, other than wear it in bed.  Over the past two nights it has done a good job of detecting the times that I am going to sleep and awakening.  It detects "restlessness" which corresponds to times that things would be happening that would interfere with my sleep.  I am an extremely light sleeper so any activity in my room awakens me (wife coming in after I have, her going to bathroom,etc). I did notice that last night I check the time on my Surge (tapped face to activate the light).  It recorded it as "restlessness."  Apparently for it to register as "awake" you have to get up and move.

I have trouble staying asleep... So often, just like last night, I wake up to go to the washroom half-way through... I spend a long time (like 1+hrs rolling around) after because it takes a while to fall back asleep...But it never resumes tracking. It just says I slept 4 hrs instead of the 8.5 I was there (which should have yielded ~6.5-7 hrs actual sleep.
Hi @ForecasterJason, Thanks for the explanation. I see what you're saying now. Not sure what the answer is though. Hopefully someone more knowledgeable will chime in on the topic.

For sleep or all day monitoring? For sleep, I would wear it on the right hand. It is meant to be the hand less likely to be moving and if you naturally prefer your left hand than I would consider the right the non-dominant for sleep monitoring. All day activity? I am not sure it depends which hand you use the most. Obviously if you are writing than your left is non-dominant, but for other activities your right is non-dominant.

I read above that the Sleep Score is scientifically inaccurate, but see no links to any studies to back your claim up, @Jessgrl325
My FitBit Flex is no longer registering sleep mode and I have not been able to determine why.  Logging into my account, I am seeing a message that "My device does not support this feature". Up until a couple of days ago, I was tracking my sleep.  Yes, I have reset my tracker but that hasn't helped. As well, just this morning, I sync'd my tracker and was at 3,900 steps.  After resetting the tracker again, my steps are registering the same number as yesterday's steps (13,695 for today and same number for yesterday) -- even after resetting tracker a couple of times. Can anyone shed any light?
errr, you cannot sleep because you dream and you feel like you are living another life in the dream and you have to wake up to snap out of it? ... hmmm ... i dont think fitbit technology and community covers that. hope you'd find a solution to your dream problem though.
Thank you everyone for all the great suggestions about going to sleep - I have no problems there. Falling asleep is easy. It's staying asleep I haave problems with. I just seem to wake a lot during the night, so I'm thinking I don't really get into a deep sleep. Finding some early morning sun is quite a challenge. I live in Lancashire. Most mornings are dull and rainy, dull and windy or just plain dull.

I too have restless leg syndrome-- it is worse on days when I have extreme levels of activity (over 25,000 steps) or too much inactivity (sitting time). Doctor was going to order a sleep test based on a machine I wore one night but after I shared my Fitbit records he backed off (in part because I carry a CDL-though I rarely drive a truck). He wanted to try a Cepap outfit but after seeing the Fibit records and reviewing the machine test plus interview decided it was likely only a combination of RLS, sinus pain, and hip pain (need hip surgery someday). He prescibed Pramipexole 0.5 mg-- 1 tab 2 hrs before bedtime- more if I feel it is needed. Not sure it does anything for me. Anyone familiar with this drug? Phil
Hello, I'm now using Fitbit for a few weeks and have noticed I'm getting good scores on average that seem to be representative with my feelings.However, I've now already had 2 nights I slept really bad. Being mostly awake from 4am till my alarm. By the time I wake up, I'm tired, sometimes even worse than before I went to sleep. Strangely enough, on those nights I'm getting the best scores. Is there a way to send feedback about those nights and indicate that this score is wrong?
I just got up turned on the internet and read here: High levels of stress can disrupt sleep, including deep sleep. Relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation or yoga can help in this case. Finally, watch your caffeine and alcohol intake, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime, as they can interfere with deep sleep.

I sleep terribly. I knew this before I got my Fitbit. I am perpetually tired but I am also anemic and have hypothyroidism so I am sure that contributes.I usually sleep 6ish hours. I am and always have been a light sleeper. On the average I get about 45 minutes of deep sleep, and I complete about 2, maybe 3 full sleep cycles. If i sleep 8 hours, which finally I did last night I feel like trash. All day long. It says I got about 1 hour and 24 minutes of deep sleep. I should be feeling great but I feel just flat awful everytime I sleep like this. I had 3 sleep cycles complete last night.  This causes me stress because I simply do not know how to fix this. I am not willing to do a sleep study.My sleep score is in the low 70s, a few sixties, and one 83 last night.  Anyone else have these problems?
Hi everyone, now that I'm starting my journey to loose weight and building muscle, my trainers at the gym always recommend to me I need to sleep better. My question comes from this particular recommendation; How sleep and lack of it can affect your workout?
 

 
Apparently with a nice workout session and increasing sleep time, marked improvements in performance, including faster sprint times, longer endurance, lower heart rate and an overall better workout. So if considering that quality sleep keeps you performing at your best, poor sleep habits may be altering the intensity of your workout. Less overall energy means less energized workouts
 
In addition, rest is critical to the recovery process because while you're resting, your body is building muscle. This happens most efficiently during sleep, and without enough quality sleep, your body cannot fully recover from exercise. Finally, a lack of sleep can affect diet and eating habits. It says sleep loss can interfere with hunger hormones increasing appetite during the day and bringing on cravings.
 
In addition to your fitness routine, these are a few more ways sleep can impact your health:

Regulate blood pressure and cholesterol
Reduce stress
Increase energy levels
Boost immunity
Manage cravings and appetite
Stimulate mental clarity and memory

I believed this topic in some way is related to my previous post about: 5 tips to improve sleep.
 
What do you think about this, can you bring more ways sleep can impact a nice routine at the gym or in a daily basis activity?

Unfortunately, this has happened to me on multiple Fitbit devices. Always the same, it claims it could not get accurate details - yet tracked my HR all night. As a strange aside, I have a hard time getting blood drawn, my blood vessels are hard to find - and apparently this has something to do with why every single Fitbit can't give me the Sleep Stages that I have been paying for. Occasionally, one night - with no changes at all a sleep stage will pop up and then not again for months, if ever. It is the single most frustrating thing about my Fitbit ownership.
Thanks! I'll try it again on a day I don't work. Lol. Sent from Outlook Mobile
Thank you for the information. This has been a nightly issue. Reads part of my sleep, then reads as though im awake then will pick up on my sleep again giving me 2 separate reads.One with a graph and the other not. Im going to buy a new fitbit and see if this is just getting to old. Its been almost 2 years since I first got this one. Thank you BJ
I absolutely love the new Sleep Schedule and reminders that started about a week ago. I would really like to see my "sleep schedule" show up on the computer dash board and not just on the mobile device. Anyone else feel this way?
Not Necessarily! If Fitbit says you are awaking 10+ times a night, I would also say, look at how you awake each morning and how do you feel during the day or have you seen any physical changes.  i.e: Do you awake each morning feeling like you didn't sleep at all? Do you go through the day feeling exhausted and take several naps?With lack of sleep you would see 'bags' or black circles around the eyes. My Fitbit says I have 0 awake moments but average about 8 restless periods a night.
Just wonder if anyone knows the normal range of sleep efficiency using sensitive tracking? I thought I was a good sleeper, but Fitbit said I am getting only 45-55%.
I start my sleep log on my phone. In the sleep section in the app I have a plus sign in the right upper corner that brings up the "sleep now" button,  Once I click that, the screen changes to "I'm awake". I go to sleep and in the morning i click that. It is a lot of work for something that should happen automatically but I want the info that is the only way it comes up for me.
I always thought that it had more to do with your slower heart rate than with how still you are. I've got a couple of sleep logs that are 40 minutes and 52 minutes.
I noticed REM levels have dropped significantly since taking Motrin for pinched nerve during the last week. Does anyone know if Motrin affects REM
AH HA! Go to Google Play and update your app. Now it works!
I hate it and it's not accurate.  I usually sleep between 6-7 hours and the sleep score is saying 3-4.  If that was the case I think I'd be the walking dead
Hi sleepy fellows, I have a question about the sleep logs settings. On normal sensitivity setting, I will get average 6 hours of sleep (deep blue) out of  9:30 hours of sleep time. On sensitive setting, the duration of sleep shrinks enormously down to average 2-3 hours, and restless time (light blue) accounts about 70% of whole sleep hours. Have I been spending 6 hours toss and turn on bed every night, comparing only 2-3 hours actually sleeping? It just sounds unthinkable to me. Do people get the same amount of sleep as I do? Having read many contradicting posts , I start to think the sleep sensitivity is becoming kind of myth going around in the community. Many members suggest that normal sensitivity is appropriate setting. But even more recommend, from their own experience, that sensitive setting is accurate. You can leave your sleep logs and your thoughts on two different settings.lets bust the myth.

Ever since November of last year, I cam back to Regina Saskatchewan from Vancouver to take care of the remaining belongings of my late MOther and sale the house. For a while now, my sleep is horrible and I have a hard time falling asleep until around 3 and sometimes 4am. Is anyone else having issues and can someone recommend anything considering self isolation and not able to work out. Uhgg. Of all the times to be slamed but I know I am not the only one and there people worse than me. Just looking for a few suggestions. 🙂
I've noticed that even when I'm not moving that sometimes it registers that I am. My husband wakes up at 5am and if I look at my stats, I can see lots of movement then, but I know for sure that I'm completely out. Could it be because he has to halfway climb over me to turn off his alarm (it's on his dresser on my side of the room) or is it really registering his movements as well? I've noticed it does it when he says he got up to go to the bathroom as well. I wear a Flex on my left wrist (non-dominant) and the One on my right (I've noticed more accurate tracking when I combine verses a single one).
You guys can add your votes to this sleep challamge request.
I use this feature on my Charge 5. It works well enough. It rings during light sleep typically or sometimes when I am already awake. If I still sleep deeply enough or in REM it will ring later. It is rare it rings at the time limit. It vibrates and wake me up without problem.
The longest ive slept is probably around 5/6 hours, which may sound horrendous but I average around 2/3 hours a night so 6 hours is heavenly for me *_*
I would go with Normal at first.  If you feel the result are not accurate you adjust the setting accordingly.  Also pay attention to the Dominant vs. Non-dominant hand setting it does make a difference.
Is there a way to compare my sleep data to others who have the same setting as mine (i.e Sensitive)? The report I get seems to link all sleep (wether the device is set to sensitve or normal).
I have always had a hard time getting to sleep.  Often wake up very sore and tired.  I have just gotten my fitbit and I had it set to normal for sleep monitoring.  The results were 7 times awake (I had gotten up only once to go to the bathroom) and 38 times restless.  It logged in only 6 hours of sleep but I was actually asleep for a little over 7.  Would this mean that I am moving so much in my sleep that it even thinks I am awake?  I know I was exhausted as usual all day long.   Since it is my first time with a fitbit should I be concerned or is this normal?  If it is me I think a talk with my doctor will be needed.  I already have insomnia so I need my sleep that I do get to be sound sleep.  Any advice would be welcomed.
My device stopped logging details also.   I can't recall what version of the Fitbit I have.   Seems that mine has been the past two nights also.
I saw this tip in another post and tried it out.  You cut the top off from an old tube sock (about the width of a sweat band).  You can than clip your one to it.  It stretches and is very comfortable.  It is a cheap solution that works well for me.
You don't think u think it would be dull to complain for something that doesn't work when not worn? So yes obviously I wear it during my sleep. I appreciate the help but I have already tried all the tricks in the hat.
That is the best fix short of Fitbit getting their act together.  Two touch...edit, save!  Beats deleting and re-entering.   Thanks!
I would like to show my sleep doctor what my Fibit is collecting about my sleep patterns.  Is there a way to print out  the charts or history or the graphs themselves?   Thanks
I have noticed the same sleep issues with beer consumption. 1 Hour from Napa? Nice!
opps my mistake should have read the posts here first haha Found out how to edit the sleeps.but couldnt see how to delete my post, so just letting you know all is good!
That’s exactly what I started doing the day after I posted this post! I put it on my ankle (I have a scrunchie band on mine so it struggles getting on and off but is so comfortable I don’t feel it when it’s on. I put it as non dominant and now it’s tracking every step beautifully. It still tracks my heart rate and oxygen fine too. Thank you Golda ☺️
How does your product get worse with each iteration?    There is a problem here that Fitbit needs to fix instead of ignoring it.
Thanks! That helps!Stephanie
Hi @Malivan66,First, you can look at if there are ways to improve your length of sleep during the months you are working. I don't have specific advice there, but maybe you can ask your co-workers for tips. On the months you don't work, it makes sense that you wouldn't sleep much better, because by then your body is used to that kind of schedule. Those three months off can be important to help catch up on missing sleep. What you want is to "reset" your internal clock to get used to longer sleep during those months. I find getting a bunch of exercise helps keep my asleep longer. Once your body gets used to longer sleep, you can dial back the exercise, but at the beginning you can pour it on. Also, things like keeping the bedroom cool and using blackout curtains to block light can help. This forum has lots of tips for things like that if you look around. Good luck!

For example, the other night I got 1 hr 37 mins of deep sleep + 31% REM and the score for that section was 20. I got 7 hours sleep overall that night. Then another night I got only 1 hr 3 mins of deep sleep + 29% REM but my score for that section was 21. I got 6 hr 14 mins sleep that night. It happens all the time that when I get MORE REM / deep sleep, that part of the score goes down. Doesn’t make sense to me. Make it make sense?! Lol
I have an android and have the same issue. I connect them every day and tje next they are no longer connected and they never share data
Hi @RonRM I've had this happen a couple of times too, sometime because my heart rate is a bit higher than my normal resting. No matter what the reason is, you can edit your sleep time and the score will adjust. On your mobile device go to the Today screen, view the details of your sleep score for the day you want to edit/correct, in the upper right corner of the screen you will see ... select it and you should see a menu:Edit LogDelete Sleep Log Edit to change your time asleep. Hope that helps.

You can try syncing your Fitbit right when you wake up. It usually works because syncing the Fitbit by opening the app requires you to click on the app. If that doesn't work, go on the app before you sleep, click on the sleep section, and hit "Begin Sleep Now". When you wake up, go back to the app and click "I'm Awake" or the button that declares you are awake (I am unsure of the exact phrasing). Worst comes to worst, take a bunch of steps before you shower, because it should trigger the Fitbit and let it know you are awake and moving around. I hope this helps 🙂

Thanks for posting your screen shots - i was wondering what sleep apnea would look like from the watch data - i just have a multiple wake up problem not a sleep apnea problem.
@JennyTheUnfit as long as you feel well rested, I can't see why it would be a problem. It sounds like you know what your normal range is and that seems like useful information to have.

Update: The Estimated Oxygen Variation graph started showing up in my app now.
Hey! So I actually started showing symptoms while in college. It was very gradual for me. I fall asleep after about 10 minutes of reading. Honestly it is possible to get through PA school. I scheduled naps. I put a half hour alarm every time I had to study and it woke me up whenever I fell asleep. I practiced good sleep hygiene, I did not pull all nighters, ate a healthy diet, exercised daily and kept myself healthy. In the end it worked. I graduated and I’m doing very well. Currently I’ve been in family practice for almost 6 years now and I have a great patient panel. Right now I’m in a COVID19 testing tent which sucks. But my point is, it is possible to control your symptoms. I’m currently taking Effexor 150, Wellbutrin 150 and adderall 20 daily. I find with that I can for the most part function. Good luck to you! And wherever you are, stay safe.
I also think Fitbit should take some ownership here and release their analysis data. They have data from millions of people and should know exactly what's normal and isn't and be able to link it to other data.... (the other companies they sell our data to). In return they could really share some more insight on what causes these patterns.
That looks brilliant - wish I could get such long periods of non restless sleep - I'm sure that would help my memory.
Pretty good
This morning the sleep display on my apps was fine. Now it’s useless, just vertical lines, with no info on deep sleep, which is what I was most concerned about. I was about to rave about the awesomeness of this sleep tracking to all my friends, but now all of a sudden there’s nothing to rave about.

My sleep looks very similar. Meditation is aways a good idea, but in my experience, exersise is the problem. I know I don't get nearly enough physical activity, but my job as a software engineer requires daily learning. I think that's why I get less deep and more REM. Back when I was exercising, I think I remember Fitbit telling me my cycles were more balanced. I'm going to try and start exercising again when our elliptical gets here to see if that helps, but it's hard to find time with a needy baby around.
I have had my Fitbit One for 4 days/nights now and it has never shown anything but 100% sleep efficiency although the graph shows my sleep being interupted many times during the night.  What is up with this?
Sleep 😴 💤 :bed: 😪 I'm so tired of being tired as well I'm not sleeping well @ All ,maybe an hour here and there, I don't get to sleep till the am when it's like 6:30-8:00 🙃 I NEED SLEEP 😩, any suggestions?? Thanks
Check into things like what does she do before sleeping? what does she eat? Also, you share a room, is there something you are doing that might be an issue? She might have something like sleep apnea or allergies or light sensitivity or need more melatonin or... there are so many possibilities that the sleep study is really going to be your best idea. Most people with sleep issues are taught to keep a sleep journal (what they ate, what they did for 4 hours before sleep, how they felt, temp of room, etc) she might be old enough for this.
thank you! 😊
Does anyone have a problem with your band getting tight while sleeping?
I haven't been able to figure out a way to enter comments about sleep either.  Figuring out insomnia means looking for connections between sleep data and the stuff that happens during the day, so a sleep diary is key.  I hope someone can tell us more.   I haven't signed up for a premium account because I'm not that impressed with my Charge HR's data.  For instance, it often fails to keep track of heart rate during exercise, and it does not consider the hours-long long awake/restless period I apparently experience around 2 a.m. (with no memory in the morning) to be part of sleep, so that the sleep efficiency number is meaningless. Thank you for posting the question.
Hi all. I purchased a Fitbit Flex a couple of weeks ago for the sole purpose of getting my sleep analyzed.I have had sleep issues for years, including some horrible insomnia for over 18 years (couldnot sleep during night time) which I recently cured 2 years ago by moving to the other side of theworld (my biological clock was messed up, was like by body was in another time zone) whichamazingly fixed it immediately. However one major change accured which I noticed in sleep quality.I went from being a very heavy sleeper to a much lighter one but did'nt see an issue with it. The otherissue was I have been waking up very tired almost everyday. After a few days of sleeping with the Flex I have found that I am restless  about 60% of my "sleep"duration. Usually wake up once and am restless a good 10-15 times per night. Was wondering how accurate this has been found to be by other users and if anyone has any recommended solution for all this extra restlessness. Thanks
It would be useful to be able to log how you feel each morning (e.g. refreshed, tired, groggy or wired, or maybe just a simple scale 1-5 ) in the Sleep Log so you can see how the aspects of the sleep data (restoration, time, awake periods etc) affect how you *actually* feel. I have often been told I had a "good" sleep score, but in fact I feel dreadful like I had a terrible night's sleep. Having a log of how you feel along side the data can help you identify, for example, how much sleep you personally need and, if sleep appears to be "good", you could then look at what other factors might be either causing fatigue or having a positive effect. Without being able to log how you feel compared with the data, you can't see any patterns. I also think this data would massively contribute to AI learning about the relationship between sleep and tiredness across the population. In addition to logging how you feel there could potentially be other things to record like whether you used your phone before bed or had a bath or used a sleep pillow mist.... Logging pre-bed activity could help people hone their bed time routine for the best nights sleep.
Yes I do but I was looking for some ideas so I’m not any help I’m afraid 😟
An issue I continue to have is, no matter how much sleep (deep or light), I tend to wake up very groggy. I think I found a clue as to why and maybe it's my elevated heart rate during sleep. See the picture here:    I tend to have low-ish blood pressure and heart rate during the day, I exercise and sometimes take microdoses of Melatonin.  What can I do to keep my heart rate lower during sleep and perhaps get that U shape to my heart rate graph consistently?
My first fitbit 1 displayed the sleep details without me having to manually sync in the morning. I don't have it on a mobile app or anywhere else but on my computer. I lost that one . My new one doesn't display the sleep details unless I manually sync it in the morning when I check. Is there something wrong with it? Or, is it just different now?  Hope you can help. Thanks.3/2021 - I no longer have this model.
I have sleep apnea.  I told my sleep Dr. about the lack of deep sleep on the FitBit.  of course, he said there's no way to get an accurate reading without getting all hooked up in the sleep lab.  However, I said I thought it was 'relative" as it does show different amounts.  I'm not happy with my deep sleep results.  However, it could be a whole other issue.  who knows.  I'm trying everything within my power to gain some DS.
Me too, and based on how I was hung up on by customer service, I would say this took all the reps at fitbit by surprise too! Since I received no resolution on my request, I can only infer that this is a new "feature" that you only get with "premium" fitbit will take your 10 dollars/month now.
What can I do to improve the REM and Deep Sleep stages?
Thanks, but for whatever reason, I can't click, frustrating. Maybe timeto call the help desk!

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
I regularly go to bed no later than 10pm and I am confused as my tracker says I go to sleep at 11pm? I do drink a fair amount of wine so sleep normally happens as soon as head hits pillow. Where is the missing hour. This happens every night??
We know the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays (TV, computer, tablet, smartphone) is detrimental to sleep, especially if/when exposed to it during the few hours that precede bedtime. I just read a blog post that mentioned using these cheap glasses an hour before going to bed (if watching a display during that time): The "official" description lists them as safety glasses, but if you read reviews on Amazon, you’ll see a lot of them touting the glasses as "sleep aids". For instance, this one:  Is anyone using similar glasses for the purpose of blocking "blue light"? I thought that – for the price (less than 8 bucks) – it would be worth giving it a shot.

Sleep not working 2 different nightsthis week.  Battery is not low.Sleep is same schedule.No updates avail.Restarted device done.Any other ideas friends? TIA
My Versa2 will only log my sleep after midnight.  How can I get it to report all my sleep.
My sleep goal is to sleep in each of the best hotels in the world, on those pretty beds. Quite interesting challenge, you know. Who's with me? 🙂
According to my tracker I do get enough deep sleep but get very very little REM sleep most of the nights. It's around 5 % wich is about 30 - 50 minutes. I also hope my fitbit is wrong. If not, is this something to worry about? And what might cause this little REM sleep?
Hi @Smashers249, I would take a lack of restless sleep to be a good thing. Did you mean the opposite?Also, I don't see any screenshots in your post.

They still haven't fixed this yet?
This gave me more questions than answers....First of all I'm seeing lower numbers on the fitbit itself, when I'm resting during the day and woken up during the night.The device gave me 70 during last night, but it saw 58 when I was in the toilet. Just now as I'm lying on the bed awake, I watched 54 bpm:s on the app.So it must be that the device is configured to take those readings from a specific time, rather than the lowest bpm?I'm just trying to understand the habits of this device...
Crossfit is very hard exercise, and easy to overdue in my opinion. If your body is running behind (as it sounds like it is), I would be looking to reduce intensity or frequency. There's nothing wrong with doing less intense exercise for a while and let your body catch up. With so little REM, I think mental fog is to be expected. Deep sleep is huge for physical recovery, so again, I would take a look at your workouts to see if you can adjust them, at least for a bit.

I've just reaing the 'About Sleep tracking' post which states: Remember, it's important to put the device into sleep mode as you're getting into bed, and take it out of sleep mode once you're waking upI don't even know how to do that! So maybe that's where we're going wrong?
ja das ist normal weil der Körper sich in der Tiefschlafphase erholt und dann sinkt auch der Puls.Ich habe einen Herzinfarkt gehabt und habe Schlafabnoe und kenne mich ein wenig mit dem Thema aus.
@LorAM82 which device do you have?

So my Fitbit died last weekend and needed to buy a new charger which I did on Sunday and since then it’s stopped automatically tracking sleep I manually did it last night but didn’t get the detailed graph I would normally get, any ideas ? Thank you in advance
I watch telly, like many, before going to bed and fitbit thinks that my inactivity and slow heart rate is that I am in bed trying to sleep. Consequently, I would like to delete/override the 'awake time'  on the app and  improve my sleep score and the relative percentages. This is a software update and should be easy for the developers to do. Inspire HR

The beta is full. Too bad wearing a firbit for 8 years doesn't mean anything. 😞
when you stop moving  it goes in to sleep mode.
I just bought my fitbit ionic a week ago. All my sleep graphs are a graph that shows Asleep in dark blue, Restless in a light blue and awake a red. Then I have graph that shows Awake, REM, Light, Deep. How do I see all my sleeps with this graph? The second graph that I have one night with is way better! Can I change the other ones to this graph somehow? Thanks!
I can't remember, but I am such a person where that could happen 🙂 . I had similar dreams in the past where I dreamt about something that was on my subconscious level a lot at the moment. I like those dreams as they point me towards things my mind is busy with and help me realise.

meaning which days you sleep better or worse? and tying it to the day to see if anything about the day tells you why you are sleeping more restful or not as long? I am trying to figure out the reason for doing it when the app holds data for you so you can look over the week.. are you doing some kind of sleep study over long periods of time?

How do you balance between nights you work and night you are asleep? My Fitbit is always on day time while I am on night time 3 days a week.
I fell asleep at 8:30 last night, and the cat woke me up at 10:30 pm. Got back to sleep around midnight and woke up about 5 am. The initial 2 hours is showing up on the previous day. Is there any way to push it to the next day? I got 7 hrs of sleep “last night”, not 5. And 7 hrs the night before, not 9. It’s messing up my score and my averages. Thanks.
I decide not to wear the Fitbit to be anymore. It added unnecessary stress
How do I track sleep? How can I add it to my dashboard?
Since the sleep graph fiasco going on in another thread, a lot of users have spoken about using the Fitbit to track sleep disorders.  I've been doing that for quite a while, so figured I'd do a short write-up. Remember that insomnia is a significant medical condition.  Minor, occasional insomnia is normal; long-term, chronic, and severe insomnia is dangerous, leading to brain damage and to dangerously-poor ability to function.  Always inform your doctor about your insomnia and any actions you've taken to remediate it; for extreme cases, find a qualified psychiatrist experienced in treating insomnia. A little background on me. Several months ago, I'd gone in for psychiatric care to treat ADHD.  I had a diagnosis and active medication until I was 16, and have been off drugs for about 15 years; it got really, really bad.  I knew I had some sleeping issues, but thought I'd resolved them—mostly. At the time, my Fitbit (in Normal mode) was showing me as sleeping 5.5-6.5 hours per night.  Eventually I took the time to look at the graphs when I woke up, checking the times I'd awakened against the red spans on the graph.  It showed times I'd spend lying awake in bed as "asleep", and counted those. Switching the tracker used to Sensitive wasn't 100% accurate, but it came close.  A few spots awake where I was asleep, and a few asleep where I was awake; and it highlighted the spans I'd spent lying awake as solid wake times. That's where I started trying to treat insomnia:  I was getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night and, near as I could tell without a sleep journal to accurately re-model all my sleep data, it'd been going on for over a year. Along the way, I used some drugs, did some research, and learned a lot.  I'm schizoid, so I don't have friends; I like information.  Pharmacology is fascinating, and sleep therapy is relevant. Actigraphy Sleep TrackingFitbit provides wrist actigraphy sleep tracking, and some mild instructions about sleep tracking.  The instructions documented are as follows: The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.The sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake. This setting may be helpful for users who wake up feeling tired even though their sleep history shows sufficient rest.It's notable the directions given all suggest a predictive strategy:  if you think you'll have a sleep-disorder-laden night, you should set your Fitbit to Sensitive ahead of time.  That's not entirely helpful, and so many Fitbit users with sleep disorders have retroactively reset the setting for sleep segments after the fact. One might wonder why it's normally okay to count rolling over or shifting around as sleep, yet completely-inaccurate if you wake up feeling tired.  The answer has something to do with wrist actigraphy in the role of sleep tracking, on which a number of papers have been published. A review of these studies published in 2004 in the American Academy of Sleep Medicine cites some discussion of sleep actigraphy's detection of sleep and waking events. More recently, Pollak and colleagues have suggested different ways to compute the performance of an actigraph’s ability to detect sleep and wake.21 They use “predicted value for sleep” (PVS) which is the proportion of actigraphic sleep epochs that are also classified as sleep by PSG, and use “predicted value for wakefulness” (PVW) which is the proportion of actigraphic wake epochs that are also classified as wakefulness by PSGEssentially, sleep actigraphy is metered against Polysomnography in the detection of sleep and wakefulness.  These are opposite states, and their detection is considered separate for good reason. If a person sleeps well, then the great majority of the measured time is accurately measured as sleep.  Failure to detect wakefulness will only mis-detect a small amount of time, thus the total measurement will be quite-accurate. If a person sleeps poorly, then failure to detect wakefulness will measure them as sleeping much more than they actually do; while failure to detect sleep will only matter for a smaller portion of the measurement. To measure actigraphy, the researchers score how frequently it concurs with Polysomnography on both counts.  Adjustments to actigraphy algorithms can change these both:  a more-sensitive algorithm will detect more-subtle motions as wake events, and a less-sensitive algorithm will detect sleep during higher periods of activity.  In essence, the algorithm is adjusted to suppress detection of one or the other. Importantly, PVS measures if a sleep epoch measured by actigraphy is also a sleep epoch in polysomnography.  If actigraphy detects wakefulness but polysomnography detects sleep, that doesn't lower the PVS; it only counts against actigraphy if the actigraph claims sleep and the polysomnograph claims wakefulness.  The same is true of PVW:  if the actigraph says you're awake and the polysomnograph says your asleep, it counts against PVW. That tuning has an important impact: In these comparisons, low threshold actigraph algorithms (e.g., defining wake as occurring even when a small number of activity counts accumulated during the epoch) yielded the best accuracy rate and PVS; however, as sleep efficiency diminished, accuracy rate diminished (evidence level 1A). Actigraph PVW was best with high threshold algorithms (e.g., defining wake as occurring when a large number of activity counts, such as 100, accumulated during the epoch) compared to low threshold algorithms but at a cost of lower accuracy and PVS.The above essentially says: If the actigraph is sensitive and detects you as awake more-often, then it will more-accurately detect sleep;If the actigraph is less-sensitive and detects you as asleep more-often, then it will less-accurately detect sleepThis sounds strange because "accuracy" is contextual:  it's either inaccurately detecting sleep (sleep when awake) or it's inaccurately detecting wake (wake when asleep).  If, of 100 sleep epochs, it detects 10 as sleep and 90 as awake, it's got 100% PVS accuracy; the same analysis would detect 0% PVW accuracy. This bit is rather important:To summarize, when compared to PSG, actigraphy was found to be valid and reliable for detecting sleep in normal, healthy adult populations but less reliable for detecting sleep as sleep became more disturbed (evidence level 2B).As I said in the beginning:  I notated the times I had woken up and validated against both graphs.  Neither is perfectly-accurate; likewise, blindly selecting graphs based on a feeling of how well you've slept is not necessarily accurate.  I've had nights where I slept poorly but got a more-accurate measure out of Normal graphs—especially as I recovered and started increasing the restfulness of my sleep. If you're not keeping a dedicated sleep journal, at least check the time when you wake up and don't fall right back asleep.  If you wake up and feel restless several minutes later, glance at your Fitbit.  It's on your arm.  When you wake up and remember being awake for a short (twenty minutes?) time at 1:25am and an extensive (hour or so) from 3:30am to nearly 5, look at the graphs and decide which best tells you your sleep based on those WASO events. Sleep Restriction I'd found also that my sleep, even once treated with drugs, was terrible.  I slept enough, but not well.  I'd been trying to go to bed at 10pm, and I woke up around 8am; that's a good 10 hours in bed, with 7 hours of sleep.  No fun there. At some point I noticed I'd sleep better if I stayed up later.  That lead me to sleep restriction therapy, a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Sleep restriction is dead-simple: Identify your average total sleep time for the week;Identify the time you want to wake up;Stay up until you've got just enough time to sleep (maybe +15 minutes);When your average sleep efficiency exceeds 90% over a week, move your bed time back 15 minutes;If your sleep efficiency falls below 80% over a week, stay up 15 minutes later;Do this consistently, every day.I handle sleep latency separately.  The Fitbit has historically calculated total sleep time by ignoring the time in bed spent falling asleep—it cuts off the sleep latency and starts from there.  I use that measurement.  If my sleep latency increases, I keep trying; if it's stubborn or large, I delay my bedtime so I'm not lying in bed awake for an hour.  Sleep latency might take a week to come down after daylight savings time, for example; if it takes longer, I move my bedtime up an hour and start again from there. Pharmacological Intervention Drugs can help you sleep; drug therapy also brings risks and trade-offs.  Those trade-offs can be unacceptable. I've gone through a lot of drugs.  You'll have to ask a psychiatrist for some help here; my experiences won't necessarily be yours. Melatonin receptor agonists include Melatonin, as well as Ramelteon (e.g. Rozarem).  Melatonin is OTC; Ramelteon requires a prescription. Dosing melatonin is hard; higher doses disrupt sleep.  At my worst, I needed literally 20mg 8-hour release to sleep; currently I do best with 2mg of 8-hour bi-phasic release.  Melatonin dosages around 0.3mg (300mcg) instant-release can be far more-effective than doses around 1mg; some research shows 2mg of 8-hour continuous-release is effective with no tolerance or rebound insomnia in the elderly. Orexin Antagonists currently only include Suvorexant (e.g. Belsomra).  This is a new drug.  It worked fantastically for me, cutting my sleep latency to an easy 20 minutes; for most people, it doesn't do anything until you take enough to make you groggy.  Suvorexant has a 9-hour half-life and will stay with you all day; maybe in the future they'll make one with a 1-2.5-hour half life that can knock you out and then leave your body.  It's C-IV, no rebound, no withdrawal; you'll need a prescription, and it's expensive so your insurance company won't want to pay for it. GABA Drugs are generally alpha-GABA-receptor positive allosteric modulators.  They bind to the receptor and cause it to react more-strongly to GABA.  There are also GABA reuptake inhibitors such as Tiagabine, which increase the amount of GABA in your brain.  Prescription required, for obvious reasons. GABA PAMs include benzodiapezines such as Diazepam (e.g. Valium) and Lorazepam, as well as non-benzodiapezines like Zolpedim (e.g. Ambien) or Eszopiclone (e.g. Lunesta).  These drugs can work; they can also have horrible side-effects, including memory loss, sleep driving, and hallucinations.  Eszopiclone made me incredibly high 24/7, and I almost drove into another car in a hypnotic state 20 hours after my last dose; I stopped, and went through one day of withdrawal—tachycardia, tremors, sweating, anxiety, depression, and the sensation of sunburn without sensitivity to touch and heat.  Your mileage may vary; don't abuse these things, never mix with alcohol. Magnesium is also a GABA PAM, apparently, hence why ZMA is marketed as a sleep-promoting drug.  Use ZMA long enough and you'll have trouble sleeping when you stop taking it; it is, fortunately, not Valium. Atomoxetine is an ADHD drug.  I'm on that now.  It's a norepinephrin and serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), weaker on serotonin.  It seems to have sharply-diminished my insomnia, so I'm now managing that with melatonin and sleep restriction.  It's been prescribed off-label for insomnia, but it's not necessarily an insomnia medication; I'm uncertain by what mechanism it's helping me. Whether you're using prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs, talk to your doctor.  Insomnia can be crippling; in extreme cases, you may want to employ a psychiatrist—potentially, a sleep specialist. f you have insomnia and ADHD, try to get away from the stimulants; amphetamine will seriously destroy your sleep.  Modafinil actually works quite-well for ADHD and frequently doesn't upset people's sleep, despite being a eugerogic; do not use Modafinil to stay up for days straight.  I used Modafinil for my ADHD before I started treating the insomnia, and it drove me to suicidal depression suddenly and with no warning (I don't respond to that kind of thing, so I observed it as an interesting and unpleasant data point and returned the drugs to my psychiatrist); if you get it in your head to stay up for a week straight on your shiny new ADHD drugs, you are screwing up badly. CconclusionsManaging insomnia is a combination effort between information tracking (e.g. sleep actigraphy, sleep journals), cognitive behavioral therapies (e.g. sleep restriction, sleep environment), and drug therapy. You should definitely report your insomnia to your doctor; for significant cases, you should find a psychiatrist to help treat it.  Drug therapies carry risks, and can be used safely and effectively for a large subset of patients; you and your psychiatrist need to determine if the drugs are necessary, effective, and safe for you.
I am on an introductory premium program.  I no longer receive sleep scores with the accompanying data which I find extremely helpful.   I bought a Fitbit specifically to track and improve my sleep.  How do I activate the sleep score?  I have spent way too much time trying to figure this out.  Please help.
I have steps in the middle of the night because we have an older dog.  I we didn't and I had steps show I would know I was sleep walking.  This would be great for people that eat in the middle of the night.  There is no way I am giving up sleep to eat.
There is a period of 10 min..maybe 2 times a month...where there is no hr during sleep. Is this a Fitbit issue or could I possibly not be breathing at night? Already have a dr. Appt. To check but I was just curious if anyone else had this issue.

I regularly get sleep scores of 90 and 91. I have FitBit premium and the score is calculated as such:  Time Asleep counts for 50 points, Deep+REM count for 25 points, and sleeping heart rate counts for 25. I scored a 91 when I was asleep for 8:45 (46/50 points), received 2 hours of Deep+2 hours of Rem (23/25 points), had my sleeping heart rate at 87% below my resting heart rate (22/25 points). Improvements in each of these 3 categories would get you to a score of 100.
Hey guys!  I am definitely a koala, I just love sleeping. In my first year at college when I wasn't working yet, one of my favorites hobbies was sleeping haha. I think I can literally sleep for a couple of days if I didn't have important things to do. So the maximum I have slept was 20 hrs  and I only woke up because I had to, that day I had one of my weirdest dreams also.

I just started wearing my Fitbit again and noticed that almost every night my heart is above resting nearly the entire night?! Once in a while I will have a night with 30 percent or so below resting. I have not worn it in a long time, but I was able to go back and see that this was already going on a year ago. I have stopped taking any medications before bed and have ruled out alcohol as a contributing factor. I am always extremely tired but I have been told to attribute it to my autoimmune thyroid disease. I don’t know why I never looked more closely at the restoration part of my sleep score. I’m floored by this info and I know some sleep tracking features are inaccurate. This is just heart rate, so it seems like it should be correct!? Does anyone else have a consistently above-resting heart rate at night - most or all night?
@marksleeples I have the Fitbit One and I love how it tracks my sleep, I was sleepy over the day and I didn't know why I thought I was sleeping well but it seems I didn't. Once, I started using my Fitbit One to track sleep I started changing some things I did before going to bed so I could get sleep   Which tracker do you have now? How's everything going?

Sent from Mail for Windows 10Hello Steve sorry my sleep pattern has not been the best right not because of my fibromyalia.And I cant wear my machine because of the pain in my neck and shoulder.
If so, when?
This is about my 6th or 7th Fitbit (they don’t last long, my last one not even 6 months, very poor quality but I like them). I have never had this issue until now, with this Alta HR.  I’ve been wearing it looser since they seemed to disintegrate due to sweat.  Perhaps this is my issue?
Help! Sleep is back to classic AGAIN for the last 2 nights. Is anyone else affected or is it just me? 😞
Hello everyone!I was reading some of the threads on the subject of sleep, and sleep quality. It seems I am not unique in my sleep graphs, but I was wondering when restlessness becomes a red-flag. I understand a lack of REM sleep is bad for the body and mind. I take hours to fall asleep, and it is not abnormal for me to have one night aweek where I simply do not sleep. I have an ambien prescription, but I've been on it for a couple of years so my tolerance is relatively high. Should I approach my physician with the results recorded by my FitBit Surge?- as a general overview I averaged 5.35 hours of sleep a night. These nights usually consist of anywhere from 9-12 hours "asleep."
I am having the same issue so hopefully they will get it fixed soon.
@veloron2008wrote:Does anyone have any thoughts on correlation between sleeping position and sleep quality?  In my case, chronic low back pain turned me from a back/stomach sleeper to an exclusively side sleeper. While the former predated any sort of sleep tracking, I can say with certainty that my sleep quality improved vastly on my sides. It could be that my back pain, which is position dependent, was a major factor here which is why I'm curious.  According to my tracker, I now consistently get 35-45% deep sleep, sometimes as high as 50% like last night (~4 hrs spent in deep sleep). A large portion of every night is spent in a vivid dreaming state. Before, that wasn't the case. As an aside, I also went from frequent snoring to almost no snoring when on my side. That's according to my wife. 😀  Any thoughts/experience? Sure, makes sense.  The more comfortable, the higher quality of sleep. I question the deep sleep number. Can you post a screenshot of the sleep chart, because I've never seen deep sleep go above 20%. Are you maybe referring to the old sleep model of restless/awake/asleep?

It sure would be nice to enter comments into each sleep record to comment on why sleep was good or bad for any given night.
It's no possible to revert it, and Fitbit has been ignoring user feedback for months already. You can vote and comment on this suggestion here: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/Removing-the-sleep-score/idi-p/3611214 But most probably it will keep getting ignored. Because you know, we already paid our money to Fitbit and nothing we say or do on some internal forums would affect their short-term cashflow, corporate bonuses and stuff. If we want to be heard, we have to take it outside, where potential customers, who have not yet purchased a Fitbit, may see and change their decision. Leave a 1-star rating in the App Store/Google Play, Amazon and everywhere else where potential buyers can see it.
Not sure when the update was created but I uploaded it on Friday 22nd and have had no logs since then. Just flat lines. I rebooted the watch, disconnected Bluetooth and picked the signal back up but nothing is working. Tempted to turn it off for a few days and then try again. Irritating that it seems connected to the update but is not taken seriously. Let me know if you have any joy. Mine is a charge 3. GwennieGwennie Sent from my iPad
I once had similar thing, fell asleep on couch, then had normal sleep at night too. They showed as 2 separate events because they were, but both counted towards my sleep total for that day, so that's prob why both of yours were starred.I have a charge 2 .
I have had habitulized hand movements whilst in bed but my mum said it would send me blind 🤣

What do the colours on the sleep graphs relate to?
I used to be able to click on the different colors on the sleep chart to tell me the time I was restless or awake during the night. That doesn't work anymore. Unsure if this happened before or after the update on March 20.  Anyone else experiencing this issue?

Im havein trouble its not on my dashboard sleep icon or my fitbit how do i solve it ta x
First, a technical remark: you don’t need to upload your images to an external website, you can use the Photos icon in the toolbar (when preparing a new message) to include images directly inside your post, as I’m doing here:   Secondly, the graph you posted merely showed the length of each night (hours slept) compared to your sleep goal (which appears to be 6.5 hours). It doesn’t tell much about the actual quality of your sleep. Has your account switched to sleep scores? Mine did a week ago, and I like the extra information it provides. It basically gives you a maximum of 50 points for time asleep, 25 points for deep and REM and 25 points for "restoration". In other words, you can see the areas where you are lacking.

You're talking about two different things: sleep history, and last night's sleep.For last night's sleep, it isn't necessarily updated as soon as you wake up.  Give it a while to at least be sure you are really getting up, and to sync.If it is sleep history you are talking about, on phone, tap sleep tile and you should be able to see your sleep history by date.  Is that what you are questioning?

I have had numerous Charge HR fitbits, the longest lasting was about year. They would disintegrate around the charger and/or the band. More recently went to the Alta as it was cheaper so if it won’t last, might as well spend less. Very bad luck. With the Altas, it was wristband issues, until I actually lost it as it fell off my wrist on a hike. One just stopped working.Sent from my iPad
I have the Charge 2 and it has been tracking sleep bery well until four nights ago it just stopped tracking.  None of the posted explanations on Fitbit's page is the reason. Very disappointing.  I have made no changes whatsoever. There is no reason for it to stop.

Ever since i updated a few days ago, my sleep is no longer recorded. I love everything else about the Fitbit, but this is my favorite feature. Anyone else having this issue and/or know how to fix it?
IOS
For my entire adult life I have been tired, I wake up every night over and over. I literally live in a fatigured state, it's ridiculous. My main reason for purchasing a Fitbit, was to see just how "normal" my sleeping was. Of course, I realise it's not an accurate gague.  In the past week my sleep efficiency is 40-55% with around 4 hours sleep per night, from 8-9 hours in bed.  I have the Fitbit one and it's set to "sensitive" as I did suspect sleep problems.  I don't snore and I am not overweight, so my GP wouldn't entertain anything like sleep apnea. I have no idea why I keep waking up. Any suggestions as to where I could start figuring out the reason for my bad sleep?
I need my pups one or both. Their warm hearty little bodies smooshed up against me is so comforting I relax and fall asleep faster than when their not there.

If it is available, for Premium it is under Restoration (below the chart of Sleeping HR). However, even for (many or all?) of those of us that had it visible, it has disappeared again. So you may not find it there. In my case I had it for a couple weeks both without and with Premium, but it is gone now.
I just wanted to register that I occasionally have the same sleep recording gap problem - as in last night when I know I was not awake for the 3 hour gap indicated for the middle of the night.
OK, so I tried it with the sensitive setting and this is what I got. I KNOW I had a rough sleep last night because I remember tossing and turning and feeling exhausted this morning, so the results seem pretty accurate to me, but it's the first rough night I've had since using my Charge HR, so I'm not sure how it would've looked on Normal!

…. It’s concerning isn’t it? I do worry about it.I’ve been taking Ashwsghadna since January and think it’s helped overall with level of anxiety but not the heart rate thing.I’ve had my gene profile done and know I have gene mutations that mean my body is very slow at breaking down stress hormones such as adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine. This means they stay in my system longer and I can’t ‘come down’ as quickly. Even cycling home post 8pm is enough to keep me awake because the adrenaline doesn’t go for hours!Maybe you’ve got the same.I’m not sure there’s a solution other than trying to live like a Buddhist monk and not ever get stressed past lunchtime!Sent from my iPhone
My daytime heart rate is fine for my activity level and age and my resting heart rate is fine. However, my sleeping heart rate is very high most of the night. From what I am learning about myself it is the way I think about, and respond to stresses. It is something I will be actively working on the rest of my life. In the meantime, I am wondering if my dosing of metroprolol might be adjusted at night to help heart rate. To help my restorative sleep. To help the way I think about, and respond to stresses. This is a question for my doctor, but there doesn't seem to be a way to make a report of my sleeping heart rate rate. It would be a shame to have to do an over night sleep study for information I already have. Is there a way to include this in the wellness report?
Hello, @Jillzdiva, @JonahV! It is nice to see you around. I'm sorry to hear that you have trouble sleeping. A couple of months ago I had problems too, what I noticed was that I was not doing enough exercise so my mind was tired but not my body. So just make sure you exercise every day, at least for an hour. Writing before bed is also good to get those feelings that are spinning in your head, out. 
 
I hope you have a nice week!

It does not have to be long to count as a seperate sleep event. I was up long enough to take the puppy out to potty (about 10 minutes) and it registered 2 seperate sessions.
I tried all that you suggested.  Pulled up health and fitness app, then sleep, still doesn’t allow me to “open” the sleep, hourly steps, or heart rate to add to my app screen.  Please help!  I am in a study for Am Cancer Society using the Fitbit 5 and need this info!
No sugar or caffeine after 10:30 amdont eat after 8pmno alcohol at all to check your sleepmy diet is really affected by what i eat and when .I cannot even take tylenol , cold medicine , antihistamines - will be awake all night .Analyze your diet . If after removing something and it didnt help it must be something else.Fitness/Nutritionist for years
I really like the quick view option, but wish there were a way to set quick view to "off" while the fitbit is in sleep mode. My hands are up by my face a lot (usually under my pillow since I sleep on my stomach) and the screen comes on so much through the night and it can be really disturbing! Anybody else feel this way?
I went to sleep the previous day, and pressed the tracker button when I woke up last night. I could not find information on how to change the sleep log, because there is no possibility to change the beginning of sleep for the previous day, there is only sleep start 0:00 of this day. This is strange. I remember that earlier there was such an opportunity.  How i can change it?
Hi I'm neuroscientist in a sleep center in PARIS, France and enrolle a research study to analyse sleep data and to learn more about your sleep.If you want to participate let me know.CheersMaxime
EdKabat did turning off and back on the Heart Rate Tracking in Settings and then rebooting resolve your issue?   Mine stopped recording sleep score and stages last night too.
I am also wondering how accurate the sleep tracking is?  It says I get an average of 4 hours a night, but I go to bed at 10:00 om and I am up between 5:30 am to 6:00 am. I could see 5 1/2 to 6 hours, but 4??
How do I get my Charge 3 to display my sleep data. I can see the sleep data on my iPhone but not on my charge 3 unit??
My husband's brand new fitbit will not give an accurate sleep analysis. We have tried all the recommendations we could find in the community.  Is it just a lemon?  Should I return it for a new one or just return it and give up?Thanks for your help!!!
Hi and thank you! I will try that. And yes I have an Charge HR 2.
Hi @Asclepias Welcome to the forum. Your tracker uses a combination of movement and heart rate information to auto identify your sleep pattern. You can also start this manually if you feel you are getting close to following asleep, to get a more accurate start time and/or you can alter the time you fell asleep after the fact, and thus your sleep data would be updated. Hope that helps.

@tam94131I have the latest firmware for the Charge and the latest Fitbit app. It seems to be pretty close to what my Flex reports. I put the Flex to sleep and wake it up, then compare it to what the Charge. Have you considered returning your Force under the recall and using the 15% discount offer to get a Charge?

Hi You should go to a neurologist. 3 hrs is not enough sleep. Try to discover what is keeping you awake. Sleep is tied to a healthy body and brain. We need 7-8 hrs a night for well being. Check if any medication has a side effect of insomna.Best of luck.Barbara
Sure. thanks for your input.
i take ZMA to help me sleep which is "Zinc, Magnesium and Vitamin B6" its great 🙂

It's nothing you would be accidentally using.  It requires you making a selection at start and end of sleep.  They are basically for trackers without heart rate monitors.To see them, on phone app tap sleep tile, then + at top right gives an option 'Begin Sleep Now'; if selected, there is an 'end sleep now' button showing next time app comes on. Here's a help section, which might or might not be any help to you:Why don't I see sleep stages today? 

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Hi @SleeperC - Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. You must have been very absorbed in your work! You can turn on Reminders to Move or just make it a habit to get up and walk or at least move your arms every half hour or so. It’s a good healthy habit, anyway. You can ready more about Fitbit and sleep here.

Hello Laurie,  Thanks for your response.  First: I have an Inspire HR. If you are right, that brings up even more questions. If the sleep efficiency variable was changed to sleep score variable, then why is the variable name in the data I pull from the API still named 'efficiency'? Secondly, if it is just oddly still labeled 'efficiency' while it is the sleep score you see in the mobile app, then it still does not check out. My sleep score in the mobile app for the 13th of december for instance is 84, however, the 'efficiency' value is 90. The minutes asleep and total time in bed do match though. There must be another formula in play here, right? Thank you. Olle
First things first:  How long has this been going on; and have you talked to a doctor?  The course of action for a short-term problem (like one brought on by school-related stress) is a bit different than if you have a long-term problem (like sleep apnea).  If this has been going on for a long time then you definitely need to talk to a doctor. So that considered, Google "sleep hygiene" for some good practices and start trying some things.  Think about the possible causes for your insomnia, and prioritize those techniques that most closely address the causes.   The techniques I find most helpful:Go to bed at the same time every night.  I know this can be diffcult if you feel pressured to study, but sleep is more important.Shut off all your electronics, and turn down the lights, about an hour before bedtime.  Use this hour to wind down.  I usually use this time to do some light yoga, wash some dishes, take a shower, or read.  Since I tend to have trouble putting down a good book even when I can barely keep my eyes open, I only read books I've already read during this hour.Try the 4/7/8 breathing exercise.  Basically, you inhale deeply for a count of 4, hold it for a count of 7, and exhale slowly for a count of 8.  I find this helpful when my heartrate speeds up just as I'm trying to sleep.
I also see the same pattern in my Fitbit.  Your post here is very helpful. I had not noticed the 2 different heart rate graphs. Just quickly checking my reading for today and looks just like yours. HR spike in the "Zone minutes" but not in the heart rate section. I will go back and compare past readings. Still not loving the spikes I see every morning in the vicinity of 1:00 am
@SunsetRunner I would say that I'll move for a tighter brace. I want this for support so wearing a tighter one could work. 😊
 
Thank you so much for sharing your second input and I'm glad to hear that it has worked for you. Still, a general recommendation for questions about health, is to contact the physician for professional advise. 
 
See you around.

So you guys have all this data mined for tracking sleep, our cycles, and how long we sleep. The wealth of knowledge you guys have for our sleep is essentially a sleep lab's wet dream. Use this information to give users their average sleep cycle (typically from REM to deep sleep then back up to REM), and then integrate a smart Alarm that gives us a range so that our device will wake us when we are in light or REM sleep so as not to wake us when we are groggy. I hate timed alarms and I wish I could be woken up sometime between 6am and 7am, when I am in a light sleep cycle so that when I am awoken, I am the least groggy. Thank you, you can reach me through my email for more details. Theyeoj@gmail.com

I just started using my fitbit a few days ago, and I pretty much ignored the sleep tracking, even though it said I only got 5 hours of sleep a night. But I recently read that getting less than 6 hours of sleep significantly increases the risk of obesity, and that getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night helps your body lose weight as well as maintain weight loss.  Has anyone experienced this? Because if so, I might have to start changing a few more habits!

Hello @Moneylogue, it's great to see you around! Thank you very much for taking the time to share your experience! @SunsetRunner, thanks for your input and I'm also happy to see you around! 
 
If you find you’re restless or waking up often throughout the night, or simply have trouble falling asleep, there’s plenty you can do to improve your sleep. Take a few weeks to tweak your habits, and track your sleep each night to see if your lifestyle changes are adding up to more Zzzs.
 
1. Turn off the lights Not just your main lighting, all those electronics with power lights or digital clocks should be dimmed or powered down as much as possible. If you can’t block out the light in your bedroom, consider wearing a sleep mask.
2. Unplug yourself Watching TV or browsing your smartphone or tablet can keep your mind awake, and your body right along with it. Avoiding certain devices right before bed might help you fall asleep faster.
3. Go to bed at a reasonable time Start getting ready for bed a little bit earlier each night until you reach your desired bedtime. But be careful with this one. The last thing you want to do is lie in bed tossing and turning because your body isn’t ready to fall asleep. Instead of jumping the gun by, say, a whole hour, chip away at it in 10 to 15 minute intervals until it feels right. But more importantly…
4. Set a Sleep Schedule Going to bed at the same time every night can help you fall asleep faster. Your body craves regularity and keeping your circadian clock dialed in is extremely important for upholding quality sleep. As your body adjusts, you should be waking up naturally at the optimal time each morning as well, as long as you’re getting enough sleep. If you have time to experiment going to bed at different times, even better! You can find the time that works best for you. Set alarms on your Fitbit device. Bedtime and wake-up reminders, which are calculated based on your sleep logs, can help you achieve a more consistent sleep cycle.
5. Keep it cool Studies show it’s easier to fall asleep when the temperature is cooler. If it’s too hot, or too cold, it can be more difficult.
6. Cut back the caffeine & alcohol Try limiting caffeine intake to just mornings. Caffeine can affect your sleep for hours after drinking it! Studies have shown that drinking alcohol before bed may help you fall asleep faster, but it will also cause you to toss and turn— or wake up—more throughout the night as well, bringing down your overall sleep quality.
7. Get active Hitting your daily step goal  can help you sleep better, too. Try making an effort to workout during the day, and your sleep quality should improve, too.
8. Stay positive Learning how to destress and having a positive outlook is the best thing you can to improve your overall health and your sleep. Find simple ways to unwind at the end of the day—a walk in nature, a breathing session with Relax—so you can ease into slumber and have a great night’s sleep.
 
Have a great day!

At first I loved that app. Now I'm not so sure. I have a tendency to wake up before my alarm. The problem is I am not really awake. I'm kind of restless. The app has stopped trying to wake me up early. It thinks it can wait until my wake up time to start going off.

I had the One up until last weekend and never had problems with the sleep tracking accept that I hated the wrist band that often came undone while sleeping. I bought the Flex over the weekend and have yet to figure out how to get the thing into sleep mode. I checked the website and followed the instructions there, but it's just not working. I've found the tracking itself (on the One) to be pretty efficient and accurate. I like the fact that if I forget to turn it on/off, I can enter it online and it still shows me how many times I woke up during the night.
Hello everyone! 
 
Have you asked before why we feel tired at work? 
 

 
Workplace fatigue isn’t just being physically tired, sometimes it’s being mentally exhausted. Work fatigue is an event that isn't relieved by rest and a constant state of weariness that reduces your energy, motivation and concentration. 
 
Let’s take a closer look at what causes work fatigue and what you can do to stop being so sleepy at work.
 
Not enough or poor sleep: This is one of the main causes of Work Fatigue and this is due to a lack of adequate of sleep. 
 
Insufficient downtime: Sometimes we are sitting in from of a computer looking at the screen, while we can blame a portion of that on work, most of us usually spend hours attached to our mobile devices or laptops. 
 
This does not only affect the ability to get a proper rest (device that emit blue light like phones, tablets, and laptops can also reduce sleep quality and increase depression, and stress) but it is actually confirmed that when not being able to fully disconnect from work is a major source of work-related fatigue.
 
A few ways to fight work fatigue and regain your energy all day long: 
 
Manage your motivation: It is necessary to create your own workspace and your brain to self-motivate. Let's start by changing up your workspace to reduce clutter and make it more action-oriented. Taking into consideration that Clutter provides distractions and therefore, unmotivated. 
 
Take more breaks during the day: Taking breaks can help to improve your productivity or combating fatigue. The human body follows a rest-activity cycle around every 90-120 minutes. At night, that cycle takes through the different stages of sleep. During the day, it manages the energy and alertness levels.
 
This means is that your body craves a break to rest and recover after about 90 minutes of work. Once you understand this rhythm, you can use it to your advantage by scheduling your breaks so you are resting and recovering when your body needs it most.
 
Develop some meditation routines: Some studies have determine that Yoga and meditation can help to decrease the stress and anxiety that lead to work fatigue. 
 

 
You don’t have to relegate yourself to feeling tired at work all the time. Instead, determine the cause of your work fatigue and try one of these solutions.
 
Hope someone else can share more tips about how to manage work-fatigue 😊
 
See you around.

I do meditation before sleep, and can fall asleep almost instantly, but staying asleep is not happening!
Like I said in my other post it's not the getting to sleep or waking up I have the problem with it's the constant dreaming that is so vivid an seemingly real that it's like I live two lives.. I have woken myself up at times to try and escape them only to return often to the place I was before. I recently retired ..I was a truck Driver for 40 years and I never had a actual schedule only thing I could do is force myself to go to bed to get at least 6 hrs sleep even if that meant 6 pm.. Because of that I have always been an early riser regardless on average sleeping past 5 am was like sleeping in for me.
Please add the prior days steps as a line to the bar graph that shows the total.amount.of sleep on a daily bar and within the bar it brakes down the amount of time in each sleep stage.  Adding the sleep.score would also be great information.I got a notification that on days I walk more than a certain amount of steps I get a certain number more minutes in deep.sleep.But shudnt it be comparing prior days steps to current days sleep?
Still hoping fitbit will allow more than one device on an account. I really would love to be able to use my One during the day and use a Flex at night and at some other times.
Natural sunlight,daylight is better.Light boxes can help some people.The timing of light exposer is more important plus there's such thing call the dead zone whereby light will not shift the timing of your sleep. Light boxes are not a very good treatment for circadian sleep disorders as we are all individuals and are needs are different. I have N24 sighted sleep disorder and a light box hasn't worked for myself.On the topic of N24 sleep disorder most of those with this disorder are better off to free running to their own natural sleep times which other view as odd.
Thanks for sharing @Robert026 I find working out (as long as it is not close to bedtime) helps me sleep better.  Also, 3 mg of Melatonin helps with my sleep.  Limiting tv, computer and phone use for a few hours before bed also improves sleep.
That is by design. The top section (all green) has arrow to go back and forward, thus allowing you to see data from previous days. However, below that the data is in individual boxes and only displays data for the current day. To see historical data about sleep, touch the sleep data box and you will see past data in graphs and sleep insights depending on the type of Fitbit you have and if you have that feature turned on.

I'm looking at getting one too. It seems very versatile having different settings. Some nights I might want something firmer than others, depending on how the back feels.

From How do I track breathing rate in the Fitbit app?    And from  a Cleveland Clinic article https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10881-vital-signs"Respiratory rate: A person's respiratory rate is the number of breaths you take per minute. The normal respiration rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute. A respiration rate under 12 or over 25 breaths per minute while resting is considered abnormal. Among the conditions that can change a normal respiratory rate are asthma, anxiety, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, lung disease, use of narcotics or drug overdose." An interesting thing heard in a doctor's talk, that I cannot provide reference for, and I probably am not explaining well, was that in the early days of Covid, sometimes people came to the hospital feeling okay but they found oxygen levels extremely low, but their breathing rate had gradually been increasing to make up for that, until eventually it could not longer make up for the difference; then patient would seem to suddenly get much worse, thought it had in fact been coming on gradually.

It's worth trying switching it to the other wrist overnight.  Maybe you tend to sleep on one arm, or one arm move around more than the other when asleep.

If I sleep for 6 hrs a night and an awake for 1 your is that 7 hours of recommended sleep.
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
@Specky   This might be the answer.  Your top graph is from the Monthly Sleep Analysis.  The page says it is compared to other Fitbit users.  Your lower graph looks like it from the Benchmark data.  Your Benchmark data uses your sex and age range.  The top graph doesn't say that is it broken down by sex and age range.  Just one thought, but seems to make sense.

Looking for a comfortable fitbit to sleep with that will show my sleep stages. I have a charge 2 but it is not comfortable at night. I am getting the Charge 3 on Monday but think I will have the same issues. Any suggestions?
Thank you so much for your very helpful comment. I've just checked and ithas increased. Thank you again, much appreciated.
A friend recently told me that her trainer suggested taking a multi vitamin just before bed, saying it would help her get up and go in the mornings.  I'm terribly groggy in the mornings more often than not (due to my medications), so I decided to give it a try.  I think tonight is my 5th night doing this, and I swear I've bounced right out of bed each morning. I found some articles saying that absorption might not be optimum due to not taking the vitamins with food.  Also I was a little concerned it might keep me awake or trigger insomnia, but so far so good!  Have y'all heard anything about this?   Cheers!  🙂

Well, my friend, I'm stumped why Benchmark isn't showing up. I only use the Android and Windows apps, so it's possible there's something different in the iOS one or some kind of glitch? Other than making sure the app is updated, or trying to reinstall the app, I'm not sure what's going on. So I'll defer to a community member who's more knowledgeable about Fitbit and iOS.If we can't answer it here, feel free to open a ticket with Fitbit Support.

oh thank you .. will give that a go!
But its only accurate in conjunction with user feeback...... the user confirms they were sleeping or watching TV between two assigned timepoints.@Larry48 wrote:Yes but you infer actions by observations. You can by by summarizing movements predict if a person is sleeping or merely watching TV.
I have no issues getting to sleep but once asleep my HR is increases for most of the night. I get almost 7-8 hours of sleep every night but never wake up feeling refreshed. I have been tested for sleep apnea and that's been ruled out. Would be great to have some additional advice available on what this could mean.
I think if they offered people a choice it would not have caused a stir. I personally don’t want to have to log into the website to look at my stats. I’ve found an app that will do the same thing using an Apple Watch. So I’m selling my Fitbit. Anyone want a used Blaze with a blue and a black band?
I'm interested in why they have given us an estimate to follow, rather than a specific number.As I'm aware that one of the key factors of following one's health is the rest heart rate. Then the amount of oxygen and the amount of lactic acid in one's blood stream. And as the common man's reach is able to get these activity trackers, not the latter two, it's meaningful to follow one's rest heart rate.And I'm all the more curious of what's the reason behind this estimate.In my opinion, the folks behind fitbit have created the support pages for the greater public, not the enthusiastic people like me.
Fitbit charge 2 My RHR chart used to slow a normal variation between 48 and 53.  After the sleep stages update it has almost flatlined between 51 and 52.  This doesn't seem to match up with the Beats per minute chart like it used to.   (Many values are less that 50.)   It seems stuck on the dashboard icon at 52 BPM. I haven't seen anyone else mention this.  Does the update calculate RHR differently?  It's not the same as it was.David
your sleep tracking starts when your tracker detects a resting heart rate and no movement. You may want to try to put your sleep tracker on sensitive and see if you get different results.

I don't know that you are going to get the data you are looking for. I tried to do a search and it takes you down a rabbit hole pretty quickly without any of the info you are looking for. It all explains the how it works, why it is necessary, what the numbers mean and how to get better sleep. Even on sites not related to FitBit. The only other thing I can think of is contacting support to see if they have documentation that can be shared. I do think explaining what you are looking for is going to take some time and patience...

Thank you for such a quick response Colin! Regards, Al
For me, I find it to be very accurate in normal mode.  When I spend the time to analyze it, I can remember from the night before that either I did get up for the restroom, or was restless during a particular period.  I haven't used any other products, so nothing to compare it to, but I feel the sleep tracking on my Force does quite well.
I think that's on a different watch. Mine is the charge 2 and it says it automatically records it? Confusing haSent from my iPhone
Hi @MDadourian thank you, I am certainly trying, although this 5x50 challenge is a struggle to keep up with. I somehow ran/partly walked when tired or breathless about 12k today. My flatmate thinks I am a bit pathetic when I say I walk occasionally to gain more strength in my arches. He could be right, but at the same time particularly at the moment, I would rather listen to my body than injure it. Skiing was great. Its sent up my weekly steps to near the top, which is what I love to see. It is health week at my school at the moment and its been great fun doing exercises (hopping, star jumps, sit ups, press ups & burpees) with the kids. We were timed for a minute for each task. I look forward to see if  I can beat my numbers of each tomorrow.  A couple more days of work and then its the holidays! My gym membership is frozen for this month so it will push me to focus more on cardio. My brother's fiancee's hen do coming up mid April will be a break from exercise though... Apart from http://www.westcountrygames.co.uk/games/, which will be interesting to log on Fitbit.. Ha ha! I am so impressed with those that can do exercise first thing in the morning before work. I will try going early on Friday but would like to make it a long run as I am not working then. Hope all is well with you Michael..? Skiing was fun, had to stretch quite a bit after Saturday as my lower calf was quite painful. It is not usually a pain I get after skiing I must admit! I felt super guilty yesterday that I was too tired to do any exercise, I even drove to the gym to eat a banana and a smoothie in hope it would help my energy to come back for run club- but no, it didn't help.

Since we are told that sleep decreases in quality by age, I wish Fitbit would show age adjusted sleep scores in addition to what they are doing now. It may be that some of us who are in our 70s or 60s or 80s and have lower sleep scores or actually doing quite well compared to the population of people their age.Wish someone from Fitbit would answer this!
Me too Mike. I was so relieved! The data in the sleep graphs is very useful!
We'd have to know what the problem is first. I've used my Ultra since 12/2011 and track sleep every night. My sleep averages about 97% every night, I 'wake up' (ie, move my arm) on average 5 times a night and actually wake up (get out of bed) on average once a night. I sleep on average 7.50 hours a night. All of this is totally believable to me and I believe very accurate. Without knowing what the problem is, do you have it set on regular or sensitive? Mine is set on regular.
thank you for your help. I found the graph I was looking for. I really appreciate you taking the time out to reply.suem1

I am also suffering from same kind of issue. Not enough sleep even at night.
... as the title suggests? I ask, because on the first night I wore it, it said I took 9 minutes to fall asleep, but it was a lot longer than that. At least an hour. I'm not usually a fast sleeper. Second night, it said 7 minutes. Which was proabbly a lot more accurete, considering I'd been out and was blind drunk. Surprised I actually rememebered to put the thing on! Is it the point at which you stop moving (which I would feel a bit inaccurate, as I don;t move much while I lay awake) and if so, is this going to skew the sleep efficiency statisitcs? Thanks!P.

Hello!
 
I'm about a month into using my inspire. My average resting HR at this point is 67, and tends to run above rest while I'm sleeping. Last night my heart rate dropped from the 70s to 40 for 10 minutes and then returned to the 70s.
 
Do you think the fitbit simply became loose? I'm seeing my Dr in a few weeks to talk about my high RBC and family history of heart disease. I'm 38. Should I mention this or assume it was a glitch?

Thank you. I do pretty much the same as you. But in my case Fitbit is not treating the removal of the band (prior to me taking a shower) as the end of my sleep period.  It is not until I finish my shower etc and put the Fitbit back onto my hand and start activities that it sees that as the end of my sleep period.
Hey,@PastorTerryJ! It feels so good to sleep after a long day and taking hot shower right? Feels like heaven.  
 
OMG! Really? @Graciee   Btw welcome aboard! Do you have problems to sleep? Have you tried meditating before bed?
 
 
I hope you have a nice week!

You can edit your sleep logs; delete one of them and edit the beginning or end time of the other one.

Sometimes when people have mild sleep apnea, they are not necessarily snoring, but their body rouses them from sleep when the airway closes. So the brain sends a signal for the person to be  aroused from phase 3 sleep, for example, back up to phase 1 sleep, and the person is not aware of this during the night. A sleep study in a sleep lab would tell you whether you are being roused from sleep during the night. People usually feel like they were asleep, but do no feel refreshed upon awakening, and tired sometimes during the day.
Ah, that's good to know. Thank you 🙂My sleep display for last night is back to normal so hopefully the glitch is sorted. Phew! (Although it's made me realise I've become quite obsessive about checking it...)
It is easier to do the homework after you had sleep than with a tired brain. Try to remind yourself of that. You could do homework in the morning as you might wake up earlier when you go to sleep earlier. Try to quit doing homework at the same time each day and have an hour to unwind and then go to sleep. When that schedule for sleep is back things should get better.

I wanted to update everyone on my progress.  I've had 2 different at home sleep studies.  The first about a year ago, about the time of my last post.  It came back normal.  A year passed with treatment by medication.  It helped but wasn't a cure.  I saw a sleep specialist who ordered the latest sleep study.  This one showed lots of limb movement.  My interim diagnosis is REM sleep behavior disorder.  I have an in-lab sleep study scheduled for the end of the month. I also had an EEG which showed my brain to be "very sleepy."  It should be interesting where this goes. They say you can't diagnose sleep disorders from Fitbit.  However, I could see Fitbit recording me going from REM to awake constantly.  I could tell something was wrong but didn't have the medical knowledge to diagnose.  If you suspect you have a problem keep asking questions and seeking help.
but are you using Normal mode or Sensitive mode? I always had at least 90% sleep efficiency on Normal mode and it drops to 50-60% efficiency in Sensitive.
Caffeine or excercise, once your fully awake your awake, good luck.

Here are  some of my nights tracking - I have tried to keep as many constants as possible. Same Fitbit settings, same bed almost same temp etc The 3 hour sleep is the most “average”. The 5 hours was last night - and to be honest I fee just - if not more tired than usual - many thoughts would be hreatfully revived
The sleep score feature is garbage, either get rid of it completely asap or make it optional if literally anybody actually likes it which I doubt since all I see and hear are complaints about it. Either way do something about it now Fitbit!

I think that the time to "fall asleep" isn't accurate! 2 days ago, it said 9 minutes but after one hour of NOT falling asleep I knew that what the fitbit says is not accurate!! LOL
Thanks @Odyssey13  I watch my husband some nights and it's like he is doing hard labor in his sleep.  He also moves around a ton more shen we eat something that gives him heartburn.  I am really enjoying the sleep part of the fitbit.  It is interesting..  My sleep% went down today because I didn't push the button as soon as I woke up.  Says I wasted almost an hour in bed that I coulf of been working out before I had to go to work.  2 of the 3 nights I got a 98-99% sleep.  Oh ya great 4-6 hours
How do I do this on my desktop? My starting times for sleep are wrong too frequently...I like to keep track of my cycles and I figure you can't do that with edited data? BTW...I use an ionicThanks,Ron
I had the same issue at first, but after stealing the velcrostrap from my wife I always make sure to keep it flat during the day and take extra care not to curl it up.
I charged it and the sleep log showed up. My battery was about half way before I charged. I'm so glad its working now.
Mine always has a lot and is never the nice slope other people post pictures of
Correct, it measures only during sleep, so there is chance you will never see that 95-100%, unless maybe as the upper limit, but not likely as average.From What should I know about SpO2 values?  "SpO2 values naturally vary, and nighttime SpO2 is usually lower than daytime SpO2 due to the fact that your breathing rate is usually slower during sleep. In general, SpO2 values during sleep are typically above 90%. The SpO2 values presented are an estimate and in general can be influenced by your activity, altitude, and overall health."

I was excited about looking at my sleep pattern until my battery was running low and I had to charge my charge 2 overnight.  In the morning I looked at my sleep stages and it registered as if I had it on all night.  It was on the kitchen counter charging.  Same sleep and wake up times were shown with more deep sleep activity than normal but otherwise pretty much similar to when I wear it.Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what are your thoughts on the sleep monitor feature?
I have a question.  Which I am sure has been aske before so here it is again.   I have the fitbit charge and I gave my husband my fitbit tracker.  So here is the thing I don't always use the sleep tracker part.  My husband lately has been tracking his sleep patterns lately.  How do I keep from his patterns from showing up onto my information?  Thank you for the help in advance.
thank you, I'll check this out after I get off my Nordic Trac, JohnnyRow
Not everyone notices the buzz, but let's see if a silent alarm will vibrate for you. Read these directions for setting up a silent alarm to test the vibration. If you don't get a vibration after the alarm goes off, then you'll want to restart your device, using these directions. Please do the procedure at least three times to ensure it's working right.

I use a Nato watch strap and just clip my One to it. Has not failed me yet.
My Fitbit shows I only get 2-4 hours a night sleep. I wonder if it's because I'm always restless and turn a lot?
My fitbit alta isnt reading my full nights sleep. Only part of it. Last night it only read 1hr 8 min. I know I slept longer. This has happened many times. Ive had my fitbit Alta HR for almost 2 years and Ive loved having it. Is it getting time to replace or what could be the problem? I have tried cleaning it more often, and Ive tried changing the position of my fitbit. It still doesnt read my full nights sleep every night.  Thank you. BJ
Hello. 😊
 
Imagine that it's too late and you can't sleep, here we go again, 😅 often go to the sofa and attempt drowsing off to go back to bed, time goes and the it's already 5 am. Your eyes are tired and yet, you still can't sleep. Finally, an hour later you head back to bed and finally fell asleep. 
 
Okay, let's try to fix this and make sure you get a good night's sleep. Here are some tips: 
 
1. First, prepare your bedroom so it becomes the perfect place to sleep. Your bed needs to be at a good quality, good enough that when you lay on it you feel very comfortable, a good pillow is important too, to properly support you. In addition to this, there are different pillows, Thick, Thin, Firm, soft and find out what's best for you. 
 
2. Lighting is important, but if your room is too light even at midnight, might be one of the reasons you can't sleep well. If there are windows, you can use some thick black curtains and put those and that will do the trick. 
 
3. Also, the best you can do is to choose a bed time, set an alarm 1 or 2 hours before going to bed and when it goes off, it's your time to turn off all those electronic devices. Well, you don't have to turn them off, but at least stop using them. The Blue light coming out of the screens can affect your sleep, instead pick up a book and there will be a chance you're going to fall asleep with it on your face 😂 and you might even dream about it. 
 
4. Exercise, it has been mentioned before and it really helps your Sleep and Night. One of the exercises to improve your sleep is Cardio, so go out to the park and run for a while. Exercise will help you to stay awake in the day and no more feeling that you want to take a nap at the middle of the day 😬. 
 
5. For naps, please be careful with those and avoid them after 3:00 PM. If you really want to take a nap, do it earlier in the afternoon, use an alarm and only sleep for 15 o 20 minutes. 
 
6. It happens that when you go to bed, you're looking at the celling, trying to fall as sleep, you might sometimes feel dizzy and that something is nor right. So, if you're feeling this way, there is currently an easy solution to this and place one of your feet on the ground and you'll fee better after some deep breaths. 
 
5. Finally, eat some meals with carbs, at least 4 hours before bed. It might help with your sleep. 
 
Can you share which other tips have you been practicing to get a good night's Sleep? Have you found any helpful tip in the Sleep Well board or in different threads? 
 
Looking forward to reading your comments!

Yes.I know how you feel. I hope Fitbit will come out with a challenge for sleep!
Do you have your sleep sensitivity set to normal or sensitive, @sweetpea76?  If it is set to sensitive, try changing it to normal and try that.
I would recommend posting the idea to this forum, which Fitbit monitors for new ideas.

@NorvenaL wrote:How to load the sleeptracker @NorvenaL  Sleep mode can be tricky. It needs to be taunt against your skin. Five rapid and firm taps puts it to sleep. It buzzes, then two lights slowly fade to nothing. To check if it's still in sleep mode, tap and see two dancing lights. In the morning, tap five times firmly and it buzzes and a single light shows when tapped. That light is to show the daily goal progress. Any tap when awake is to tell you your progress - one light for each 20% of your goal. When you sync the next time, it ought to log your sleep. click to read about sleep tracking This link is to the Flex area where you will find the manual and related articles - click

Happens to me too.  I figure sometime during night, it thought you were up and calculated score;  but with later data, it realized you were going back to sleep and it should all count as the same sleep session.

So I have been progressively having more and more difficulty waking up, even with alarms. It seems to be more than just briefly waking up, turning the alarm off and putting my head back down. Most of the time I don't even know my alarm is going off. I have even stopped turning it off in my sleep: all awareness is out the window. I have struggled with this for most of my life but lately it has been getting worse and has become annoying to my roommates. I got the flex 2 and the silent alarm is somewhat helpful, but still not good enough for when I have to get up by a certian time. My sleep schedule is more or less regular, and granted I don't sleep quite as much as I probably should, but I still average 6-7 hours per night and to me that shouldn't justify the difficulties waking up that I have been having.Has anyone had the same problem or suggestions on how to solve it?
I should probably get better at winding down for bed too, but yeah easier said than done. I was about to ask why you liked the sleep feature most and what about the exercise, but then I looked on your website and realised fitness isn't an issue for you >.< lucky for some. Just finished run club, slowly getting back into running but I ought to improve my sleep pattern. I sleep fine usually, but like you say there is always room for improvement plus I hate mornings. I love fitness and fitbit pushes my cardio, which is just what I need 🙂  How senstive is your sleep feature? I have mine as quite sensitive. I might change about with it to see what happens.

Hi @Jpm85, It looks like the second bullet-point answers your question. The "sensitive" sleep setting records sleep as restless or awake. The trackers that use sleep stages don't measure by those, but rather by awake/light/rem/deep. So the two don't translate.

Dear Amanda,I followed your instruction, took Magnesium in the morning, it didn’t change my wake up at night. I guess it’s my body routine.I just have to live with it.Thanks anyway.Sent from my iPad
This is becoming a great conversation.To answer the last question posed, I'd LOVE to see a "total sleep time" way of tracking. My typical sleep pattern is sleep 4 hours, wake up for 1.5-2 hours and read, sleep another 3 hours. Ideally, I'd love the fitbit to show my 1.5-2 hour insomiac period as "awake" time in the middle of a longer sleep time, as that's what it is. It would help me to be able to show my doctor hard evidence of true insomia hours as opposed to my own report. Why? Because if you say "I'm awake two hours in the middle of every night" many doctors figure that you're like most people and overestimating. It's not that I'm waking multiple times and thinking I haven't slept in between. I'm truly just not sleeping. If fitbit could find a way to track this, I'd be able to use it to help show how my insomia may or may not correlate with other health issues I'm having by charting. I'd LOVE to be able to do that. It becomes objective rather than subjective information, and that's invaluable.
No the issue was that Alta HR is 100% stable giving sleepscore everytime,whereas C3 is alot more sensitive ( giving no sleepscore ).What i found out which worked for my C3 that gives me stable scores now isthat i had to loosening it alot more than felt comfortable around my wrist,then i get sleepscore every night.Alta HR is less sensitive that way that one i can have nicely fit ( like anormal watch ) and it produces scores every time.My band on C3 broke so im using Alta now again thats why i can compare also
While the time is correct on the fit bit, the sleep tracker is 24 hrs off (in advance). I deleted the app from my phone (Samsung S Edge) and reinstalled the app. Same issue. How do I fix this?

I think it would be so cool if you could have sleep challenges with your friends (to encourage people to get more sleep).
I am new to this...just bought a Fitbit, mainly for sleep tracking. My sleep is terrible, averaging 20+ awake episodes per night, usually very brief, a minute or two, with a big chunk of up to an hour awake as well. But I get a good sleep score...about 80! I’m exhausted. And I really don’t get it.The tracking seems to be pretty accurate but the scoring is very odd.
Hi @KaelaL and welcome to the forum. Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the sleep score function if you wear your device at night. But other Fitbit users feel the same as you and have voted for to make the sleep score optional. You can tap here to add your vote.
I think that we need to keep in mind that these methods of measuring "sleep" are algoritms that estimate your sleep based on an analog (movement). Unless you use an EEG to actually measure brain-waves, you are never going to get a truly accurate reading. This gives you a way to 1) estimate your sleep patterns and 2) compare your own sleep patterns to your own sleep patterns to see what's happening over time. Quite a cool technology, actually. Some folks just need to temper there expectations what this will do for you...
Hello, as stated in the subject I recently bought the Versa mostly for the sleep tracking capabilities using a combination of HRV/motion sensing. I was very excited to use it to see ways I can optimize my REM sleep, however upon the first night of use, I had the absolute worst night of sleep I have had in a long time.After almost 2hrs of trying to get to sleep, I ended up having to take the Versa completely off to get into any sort of deep sleep. In fact, I doubt I had any sort of REM sleep because I woke up so many times throughout the night. The Versa did accurately track those 2hrs of restlessness. Does anyone else have this issue or advice to resolve it? I am a petite person and have a very small wrist (I keep the device in the 4th notch from the watch face) if that provides any insight and I tried to adjust the Versa band where it can still track, but still wasn't too tight. If I find that this device just isn't compatible for my sleep, I will likely return it for something less intrusive like an Oura ring.
My husband just got a flex for Christmas and is having trouble with the sleep feature. For the last several nights, he's had multiple sleep recordings for the same period of sleep (he went to bed at 10:30 and woke up at 6:00 am, but there is one log from 10:30 - 1:26 am and another from 1:27 - 6:00 am). Why is it breaking up his sleep logs like this and how can we fix it?
Hi, I have set my daily goal to be a certain amount of calories burned and on some days the achievement is fulfilled shortly after I have fallen asleep and then the Blaze vibrates and wakes me up to notify me about the achievement... I don't have any notifications on, but this feature is waking me up. I usually go to sleep at 10 pm so there's a 2 hour window before midnight when the achievement can happen while sleeping. Is there any way to turn this achievement vibration of? Couldn't it be programmed to the tracker to check first if I'm asleep and then not to vibrate?
Is it possible to access previous sleep insights? i.e., via the device, app, or dashboard. I was wondering if there is a way to view the previous insights regarding sleep, e.g., "On days where you ______, you spent _____ (fewer/more) minutes in ______", etc? This analysis is interesting, but it seems like it is only available for the current day (untill you give the insight a thumb up/down, and then close the dialog). Is there anyway to view previous insights?
but i cant sleep!
Hello again, 16% REM is quite fuzzy, that 13% is markedly low indeed. If you say it often doesn't say percentages are low, I'm assuming that getting less REM is recent? If so, how long ago was it saying you were getting more REM? Any changes in your sleep environment/household (like, are people coming in and out like a college dorm or shared apartment, are there moving vehicles/trains/trucks that travel late at night that wake you up sometimes, etc).  Wearing the tracker too loosely can throw off your sleep stage readings; your device may actually revert to the old sleep stages screen if you get poor heart rate monitoring. The issue is, it'd be hard to tell where the line is drawn between "inaccurate sleep stages" and "won't measure them at all" if you're wearing it too loosely. Still, couldn't hurt to tighten it a bit if you can comfortably.

I was going for walks with my dog, but it got really cold here.I really really really need to lose weight for health reasons.It's hard to tell without knowing your environment. But in a nutshell, you have to find an activity, or two or three actually so that you can vary from day-to-day, that you will enjoy doing. Sure, if there was a gym in your area and you like that sort of thing, that would be the easiest thing to do. But there are things that you can do without leaving your home. Again, the key is to find something that you will like. It could be a couple of exercise videos, a stationary bike or elliptical workout, resistance band circuit training (you don't need a lot of space for that), and the list goes on and on really. Once you get into the rhythm of doing a workout, not only will you not feel like going to sleep after the kids are off to school, but you will feel energized; and the weight loss will come naturally. An exercise regimen should always be enjoyable, it should never feel like punishment. Losing weight because your starving yourself and punishing yourself with streneous and lengthy exercise routines is no fun for anyone; losing weight because you're becoming more active by doing things you like doing is an essential prerequisite to a permanent paradigm shift from sedentary to a more active and healthy lifestyle. Of course, keeping your diet in check is also important, especially if you significantly increase your activity level, which would probably call for more fuel.  Hope this helps. Have a nice day.     TW
Classical music helps me sleep a little better, but it depends on which composer I'm listening to, and the rhythm. I feel like the piano sound is very relaxing, especially Mozart or Debussy. 😁

I've had the same issue. It often says I'm sleeping when I'm not. If I am still for a while, like watching the nightly news from my bed, lying awake in the middle of the night, or enjoying the silence of a Saturday morning before rolling out of bed, it says that I'm sleeping when I'm clearly not. I'm anxious for it to get better, too. I'm not a good sleeper, either.
Haha fair enough, it was definitely more an eyesore than it was anythingtruly bothersome. I felt quite good that morning so I'll ignore the score.Thanks for taking a look!
i have a fitbit motivate 2 as well as thank you for asking. i truthfully think i need an exercise pal as i feel hesitant as well as careless exercising alone.
@modelinafatgirl: Research shows not enough sleep leads to weight gain. It lowers your energy level and boosts hunger and so on. Also it leads to various illness. Check this article. Here is another study done in UK few years ago.  Try to get minimum 7 hours of sleep.
Hi mines causing me huge anxiety. Looking back through my graphs they’ve gone from all green to yellow showing 2/3 times a week. I emailed my dr and this was her response  Looking online, it does appear that things like the way that the Fitbit is positioned on your wrist can affect the data on a given night. If you're having nights with all green on the graph, and others with yellow I'd think it's unlikely to be anything to worry about.  she did then go on to mention that if I noticed it was getting worse, I was extremely tired during the day  or my partner noticed me making any weird choking/ struggling noises in my sleep she would happily test me for sleep apnea. this was last Monday and since then I’ve put my Fitbit on my other wrist each night and had all greens, last night was very close to a tiny spike but didn’t quite manage it.
It worked. Thanks
Did you ever learn anything further about your few spikes? My graphs look similar to yours and I have the same questions as in your original post.
I'm assuming you're referring to the graph on the dashboard (and not iPhone app or other interface). I think the shorter "awake" segments are actually considered "restless" and the longer lines are actually "awake". The iPhone app uses a dark blue for asleep; longer, light blue for restless; and longest, red for awake.  That's how I figured this out.
Six days in a row
I have trouble sleeping also I have not be diagnosed with any issues as to why.  I did recently get a weighted blanket though, the first couple nights I didn't sleep very good but since then I have dramatically increase my sleeping and my restlessness has decreased.  It's not the cheapest option (blankets are $200 or more) but it's worth the nights rest!
100 is achievable. I already laid out how the sleep score is calculated and what metrics need to be improved to achieve 100.

I just got the email too and it's full.  Do we know when it they are going to open it more?
If you share a bed with someone, they will be able to tell if you are restless or not.  Take what they tell you (or say what you do at night) to your doctor and have a good discussion.  They may be able to identify a solution that avoids a costly sleep study or even a trip to a specialist.
Why can't sleep sensitivity be changed on an Alta HR?
Mine has been doing a similar thing! If I go to sleep at 10:30pm and wake up at 7:30am, a total of 9 hours, it will say I slept for something like 17 hours that night!
I've restarted mine too & I'm still having the same issue. The twitter team weren't any help either, just said to wait for the next update.
 
I've also noticed that it isnt tracking my exercise, although it is tracking steps.
 
I contacted the fitbit team on twitter & they couldn't explain the issue just said to wait for a new update.

Hello! What I liked to read here is that there is some audio filter that can be trained with bruxism noise and use my phone to try to detect it. Perhaps some low-noise high-sensitivity microphone hanging over my bed would make sense. Probably I'm in a specific sleep phase, that probably the Fitbit can detect. So here we have the potential to interrupt the bruxism phase by some vibrations in the Fitbit. (Dito idea for the snoring ones of us;) Where do I read from these ideas ? Is the API to Fitbit usable for this?   Now to the reasons for bruxism and some alternative was to see on it: I have read a lot about MCAS, mast cell activation disorder. Bruxism is on the symptom list. It is related to histamine intolerance, but stems from mast cells that are way to sensitive (to heat, cold, vibration/scratching on the skin, to all kinds of chemicals to skin or stomach, to a lot of medicine that releases histamine or is related to histamine or other mast cell expressed messenger substances. But depending on age and severity, only some of the long list of symptoms may occur. The longer the symptoms are known, the more severely they get for MCAS and the more organs are involved. (Childhood: bowel symptoms, sometimes only bad after parties (to much sweets, to much histamine or Theorin in chocolate), youth: lung, skin; later: arthritic symptoms, tinnistus, bruxism, heart stutters, bad headaches, neurologic symptoms of AHD, Autism or schizophrenia, etc...) Use the list of borrelia b. based Lyme disease, and you have the picture. But: MCAS have 5-10% of the population. Nearly 0% now it. (Lyme D.: 0,03%) One symptom is high muscular tones, leading to symptoms of fibromyalgia, and in this vicinity also to bruxism.By the way, high tension in the neck under the ear often produces tinnitus, because some 1/3 of population has a vital part of inner ear blood circulation by arteries leading between the neck muscles.Therefore that is remedied by massage of the neck and vibrating massage of the ear canal by keeping the ear closed with a finger on the tragus and pumping gently inward. And by manual therapy and Craniosacral methods of balancing our large bowl on the neck a-new. Diagnostic therapy:Leave out all mast cell activating substances, like any alcohol even in small amounts (therefore low-carb  anti-yeast diet, since yeast produce alc inside you as well), iodine in salt, folic acid in vitamins and supplements (widely spread to donate some folic acid here and there...) Try Levoceterizine 2-4/d for a month. Combine with antioxidants like Vitamin C (retard or depot, since you should take 0,5-1,5g/d, to protect your teeth and bowel mucosa).Also try all mast cell taming things like curcumine, thyme, tryptophane, cumin oil, etc..  Therefore also try to clean up your bowel, i.e.: bind toxics and feed the right bacteria, Lactobacillae and Bifidae. This is most effectively done by praebiotics named galctooligosaccharides, as I found here: Wolz Curabiom baby:https://www.wolz.de/produkte/darmgesund-fuer-eine-gesunde-darmfunktion/curabiomr-baby/(It's a google translate link above the link of the original link of the manufacturer. They also produce good probiotics, that helped me to get my immune system fit against infections, but not to alter my biome in my bowels, very inert to change. So I have to live with the beasts I was given between birth and 1yr old, where the biome stabilizes, minus all I have lost due to antibiotics that often eradicate one or other stem from your biome. I always ask myself: if I really have to take antibiotics, why not freeze in some sample of my biome? Perhaps to cheap a remedy...) If symptoms get slightly better, investigate further. It's a detective's game! Never give up. You have the right to be well and feel good! 😉 Of course you have to do the list of differential diagnosis for MCAS to exclude any problem leading to the same symptoms, to find a more ground based diagnosis and based on this profound therapy. Most important is to find out what you do not tolerate, any allergies, especially food allergies, second food intolerances. This may change if your balance is re-gained, so try out some years later. But to sum it up: lend some wisdom from the really old therapeutic systems, as you like, choose TCM or Ayurveda, and change your epigenetic program, e.g.  by meditation. I think in TCM you could search for kidney energy build-up treatment.A more scientific approach was given by Pruimboom: Wirkkochbuch in his Literature List, if interested, pm me. But the scientist investigating MCAS also draw conclusions in the direction of epegenetics.Eg. search for Prof. Molderings & epigenetic. For the spiritually inclined lending towards belief in a higher being, I found some analogies on the way relief of sins is discussed e.g. in the bible. While zapping I sometimes listen to pastor Joseph Prince from newcreationchurch.org and find his preaching somehow, on a high level, related to my search for cures for MCAS. Don't be fixated to one way of thinking here. Sometimes I stand upon one leg (The Tree in yoga) and pray a father in heaven. This gave me some aha-effect not only once.  Good luck! Andi
I read on the blog that "sleep stages" is NOT available on the FitBit one! But "Sleep Insights" will work on all but the Zip.See below:Sleep Stages and Sleep Insights are available globally on Alta HR and Blaze and will be available on Charge 2 in April 2017. Both features are viewable in the Fitbit app—which is compatible with Android, iOS, and Windows devices—and on your Fitbit.com dashboard.Sleep Stages will work with Fitbit Alta HR, Blaze, and Charge 2 devices. Sleep Insights will be available in the Fitbit app and work with all Fitbit devices except Zip, which does not track sleep.I don't know why the sleep stages is not available for the one! Will it be in a future update? Does anyone know?

Hi @Canadianpride I would just say give it some time, and be gentle with yourself. The loss of a parent is significant, and you should give yourself ample time to grieve. You can try the numerous tips that can be found in the Deep Sleep thread at the top of this page too.

Hello @andrea.autumn, welcome to the community forums! 
 
Are you referring that the Sleep tile no longer appears on your Fitbit App? If that is the case, I'd like to recommend visiting the following link to add tiles back on your Fitbit App: How do I use the Fitbit app?
 
If this is not applicable, please provide more details. This way I can find the proper steps and information to further assist. 
 
I look forward to your response.

I had this happen to me too.  What I did was delete all of extra automatic record and then I edited the remaining one to my actual time I went to bed and when I got up.  That took care of it.  However, it is a manual process... Do you have an old Fitbit (I have a One) that you can wear for sleeping so you wear it instead of the Blaze to do manual tracking without the extra effort?
It does show the start time of the sleep. What tracker are you using?
New FitBit Sense telling me to go to bed even though notifications are off.  Sleep seeings "Bedtime Reminder" is off. Hot Tip: Put all the notifications in once place instead of spreading them into sub-menus for everything.  I love the FitBit but the UI is extremely fragmented.
I’ve had narcolepsy since I was 12 but wasn’t diagnosed until 18, and I’m now 23. I’ve had FitBit watches for years and I really don’t think they’re accurate either. I take nuvigil 250 mg and Effexor 150 mg during the day and Xyrem at night. I take the Xyrem in 3 doses so I wake up twice in the night to take the next dose. My tracker seems to think I don’t sleep enough since I also toss and turn in my sleep. Like today, it says I only slept 3 hours 13 minutes last night, when I know for a fact I slept way more than that. It’s too bad these trackers don’t account for sleep disorders.On another note, to those who are PAs, how did you get through school? Do you have any study tips? I’m studying neuroscience and hoping to become a PA (since my dream of becoming a doctor was crushed by narcolepsy, considering I can’t stay awake overnight). Studying is nearly impossible for me since I fall asleep while reading. I have to listen to books to comprehend them, but since no one pre-records textbook audiobooks, that’s not an option. I’ve asked my sleep doctor, but she told me to just choose a major that requires less reading. Which, unless you’re artistically gifted, is kind of impossible.I don’t actually know anyone else with narcolepsy so I’m kinda excited to find people in the same boat as me!
What do you know about anxiety and anxiety disorders? 😣💤
 
Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health problem around the world. Anxiety is frequently connected to sleeping problems since worry and fear make it harder to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night. 
 
Insomnia is a common symptom of anxiety disorders. Physically, anxiety disorders can provoke tense muscles, rapid breathing and heartbeat, sweating, trembling, gastrointestinal distress, and fatigue. Not all people with anxiety disorders have the same degree of symptoms or impact from anxiety on their everyday life. 
 
Some tips to calm anxiety and get better sleep:
 

Building healthy sleep habits can make going to bed a more pleasant experience and facilitate a consistent routine to enhance sleep.
Eliminating sources of sleep disruption like light and noise, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol in the afternoon and evening.
Deep breathing, mindfulness meditation, and guided imagery are just a few approaches to relaxation that can help put your mind at-ease before bed or if you wake up during the night.

Quick question and I'm hoping you can point me in the right direction.
 
Is there a meaningful difference in sleep reporting data between the Fitbit Inspire 2, the Fitbit Charge 4 and the Fitbit Versa 3? Thank you.
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
"Because of the data from my sleep score analysis, I discovered by lowering my resting heart rate and my sleeping heart rate naturally through interval training and breathing exercises, I improved my sleep restoration." Thanks for sharing that observation and your success. It is interesting to see that the sleep score provides actionable information for improving sleep beyond just staying in bed longer.
@bethinthe805 Hi! It is not possible to set up an account for anyone under 13 years old. Therefore, the data the Fitbit tracker is giving you about your child is not accurate. This is because the sleep information will also use the personal settings, so if the date of birth (age), height, weight, gender, etc., is incorrect, it won't give accurate data. 
 
If you are giving your tracker to your child at night, the sleep data is going to use your personal settings to get information, not your child's. Therefore, the data given when your child sleeps will not be accurate. 
 
The best thing to do is to contact your child's doctor to see what's the best thing to do for her.
 
See you around!

Hi.  I've been using the FitBit Force for just over a month now.  I get a sleep efficiency in the upper 90%.  I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP.  I have been wondering how accurate these are as far as sleep goes too.
I’m looking for some tips to waking up in the morning and start my day
My husband works away so I sleep alone 70% of the time but I've noticed a large increase in restless and awake times when he's home. Could it be tracking the movement of the both of us or could I just be more restless when my husband is home?
The date for this sleep period is night of July 31-Aug.1. As you see nothing is accounted for from 3:15 a.m.-4:35 a.m. I was in bed, did not take off fitbit, and was asleep. Thank you.Teresa 🙂
Hi, my Dad suffered from a heart attack around 2 months ago (not a major one, and we were able to act fast as it was daytime and we were with him when it happened) and I was wondering if it is possible to use a Fitbit to monitor his heart condition during the night so that we can be warned if a heart problem arises when he's asleep.  He lives with me so I can keep an eye on him during the day, but the night times worry me. Is this something I can do with Fitbit or am I barking up the wrong tree?  Thanks

Me too, good to see we are not alone
I am a RN, just dx with narcolepsy with cataplexy and mild OSA. School was rough, but I denied I was narcoleptic, although I started symptoms at 5 years of age. It took crashing my car while pregnant to get a diagnosis. I find work has become harder over the years.  I am 43. I also have a toddler and preschooler.  I have such a time staying awake. I take Effexor 150 mg and Sunosi 150 mg daily.Anyone else think it is harder as we get older?
Melatonin pill combined with the ceiling fan...helps me.
I agree! Frustrating for sure
I understand that a lot of people can sometimes have a hard time falling asleep. Been there, done that. Who hasn't? But I do have a few tips if you have a hard time falling asleep. You should make sure that you always have a full day of activity. Always stay active. Exercising is great if you can never get enough sleep. It will tire you out and make you tired for bed. I also recommend to lose the electronics at least an hour before bed. No phone, no tablets, and try not to watch the television. Pick up a book instead. If you don't have books, that's sad. Go to your nearest library to borrow some books to read before bed. You can also buy books at your local book store. I recommend Barnes and Noble. But my point is, no screens before bed. Do not take sleep medicine unless it was prescribed by your doctor. Not even Melotonin or any other sleep aid or sleep vitamin. If you want to sleep well every night, you need to get it into a schedule. That also means to get to bed at a certain time every night and wake up at a certain time every morning. This will set your body into a routine schedule and you should get the right amount of sleep every night. Hope this helps!
One reason I love my Fitbit is that it is very accurate in tracking my sleep hours. It can even catch it if I fall asleep during daytime (i.e. while watching TV). However starting from sometime this year it starts to mess up. Now about twice a week, (normally one of the Monday/Tuesdays and Thursday), it only records 1~3 hours. There was a day that it totally missed my sleep. On other days it is able to record correctly (about 6~8 hours).I have a charge 2 and my wife have a versa (happens to her as well, but less frequently) so I don't think it is a problem of device?sometimes I wake up at 3 or 4am and then fall asleep again. looks like the failed ones only recorded up to that time and then failed to record the rest. but that isn't always the case.
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
I used my fitbit to test my sleep conditions as I have both RLS and Central Apnea. My Dr and I used this data to suppliment the data from the cpap and my own observations of sleep. I'm able to tell both by how I feel and by my fit bit if I've gotten enough sleep using the sensitive mode. I would test no cpap and no meds, cpap only, meds only, and cpap+meds. The main difference wasn't in duration of sleep but rather duration of continual sleep. If I can get 1 period of uninterrupted sleep for an hour (which is about the length of a typical sleep cycle) and a total amount of sleep near 5 hours, then I'm doing fine.  However, with the latest update to the sleep tracker, I can no longer easily count how long I was asleep without interruption.
@karen4u2001:  I have the same problem even without kids; dogs instead.  I've read the suggestions and am grateful that you wrote in because the suggestions are worthy of trying out; I'm going to try them too.  I wish us both lots of luck.  I think you and I can do it.  GoldaT.
Worked perfectly! I was intimidated by the 'you're gonna loose data' dialog box but I'm happy to report the tip worked. Thank you JohnnyRow!
Sorry to hear that and after it got your hopes up as well. I've had 4 nights of sleep patterns after changing wrists so fingers crossed........Sent from my iPhone
I only have one device so I am not sure if these have anything to do with it...1/  Is your Surge set to Auto or (constant) On for tracking? 2/  Would there be any device selection to track on the phone app or the online Dashboard setting once multiple devices have been reistered or programmed into the system?
The FitBit is indicating I get low REM, but I seem to dream a fair amount. I also have RBD events about once a month. I don't take any medication since my RBD events are rarely anything more than vocalizing or a little leg movement.
I don't know any options but I wear a charge HR and though it could be because I have always worn a watch I sometimes forget its even on my wrist I wear it 24/7 minus shower time. I know people have complained about irritation or burns or whatever but I have never gotten so much as a red mark from it. Good Luck !!
Look at the link below. How do you calculate number of hours? It passed 7+ hours and Fitbit calculated 6+ h... Any suggestions?https://www.dropbox.com/s/57achaksx69hpju/fitbit_sleep.jpg?dl=0
How does the fitbit (Flex) monitor the awake cycles?
An update I did not use the begin sleep feature on my app and it recorded my sleep, even though I got up and walked to my bathroom.  I did not move my hands while walking.  Well this is only one night hope for success tonight.
I'm trying to recall a memory, from June 1, 2017 (the day my father passed away) and I want to look back at my sleep stages for that morning. Using the web site, I'm able to see the day's total, but I don't see a way to drill down to the actual sleep stages. Does anyone know how to do this?  Thanks, in advance.
Update, I did turn the sleep on in the quick menu and it did finally sync with my app. Was that just a matter of time? Still want to have the screen as bright as possible!
@RonaldShow It's great to see you around. 
 
Here are some tips for beating insomnia. 
 
1. Exercise regularly: moderate exercise on a regular basis, such as swimming or walking, can help relieve some of the tension built up over the day. But make sure you do not do vigorous exercise, such as running or the gym, too close to bedtime, as it may keep you awake.
 
2. Create a restful sleeping environment: your bedroom should be a peaceful place for rest and sleep. Temperature, lighting and noise should be controlled so that your bedroom environment helps you to fall (and stay) asleep. If you have a pet that sleeps in the room with you, consider moving it somewhere else if it often disturbs you in the night.
 
3. Do not over-indulge: too much food or alcohol, especially late at night, can interrupt your sleep patterns. Alcohol may help you to fall asleep initially, but it will disrupt your sleep later on in the night.
 
See you around.

Peppermint tea really helps to calm me and I usually have a decent nights sleep if I have a cup before bed.
Don't worry about minor heart rate increases, your bpm is well within the normal threshold.  Really, its only major increases or decreases that should grab your attention. Average heart rate fluctuates significantly day by day, with factors such as diet, temperature, stress, prior activities et al having an impact.  Also consider your dream state and relative restlessness, both will have an effect on your heart rate whilst sleeping. If it's any consolation mine averages at 69bpm, which isn't bad considering I work an extremely stressful job (Safety Officer specialising in explosives, chemicals and biologicals). RE: stress. You'd be quite amazed by the physiological effects even minor stress increases can have on the body.
How do I change the sleep sensitivity on my fit bit app? Everything I find says to change it under advanced settings but I cant find that anywhere. Please help!

My RHR has been on the low side this week ("low" for me is under 64) and so has the number of minutes of deep sleep I've been getting.  When my RHR is in the mid-to-high 60s, my deep sleep is 30 minutes to an hour (or thereabouts).  Over the past few days, the number of minutes has been as low as...ZERO!  I'm getting my normal number of hours of total sleep - about 7 hours and a bit.
Im a little freaked out about this sleep efficiency thing.  Ive always slept 7.5- 8 hrs per night and as far as Ive known I thought Ive always slept really well. Ive been using fitbit for 5 days now and all my days say my efficiency is 46% -73% and that I awake 6-13 times per night.  I was not aware I was waking up at all.  I think my totals are coming to between 3 hrs and 4.5 hrs per night  of total sleep. I initially thought it wasnt working but Im noticing there are others on here with numbers like mine that say they have sleep disorders and I was shocked some are 75% +.  I feel like going to exchange mine to see if I get the same stats on a new fitbit flex.
I found the Sleep Score so valuable for my sleep tracking during the beta!  Fitbit I'm begging you!  Give me my Sleep Score back!  I'm lost without it!
Its 3 days old.... I was forced to update the firmware when I registered the device. that bing said - i still followed your instructions and installed the dongle and Fitbit Application in windows and it told me that the device is up to date.... Any Ideas?
This is a great post. Thank you, and I think everyone can take awaysomething positive. The Fitbit may mean something different for each personout there.Congrats on the change and cheers to a healthier lifestyle.
I wish Fitbit would give you the option of the new sleep monitoring and the old one because the old method in my case in much more accurate.
I have always known that I have a bizare sleep pattern.  Normally I am in bed by 9pm at the latest and get up for work at 7am.  I tend to sleep well up until midnight or 1am and then am very restless until about 5:30/6am until I gt one more blast of sleep.  My One seems to support this and my sleep efficiency is at 23% which explains why I am always so **ahem** tired.  Interestingly enough, my mother got her One and her sleep pattern is the same as mine.  It is a running joke in our family that mom and I are the two old ladies that have to go to bed early.  Hopefully I can impove on this pattern!
FWIW, Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin had some podcasts regarding better sleep (http://5by5.tv/b2w/156).  What I took from it was ditch the TV in the bedroom, make your bedroom as free of light as possible, and have the same routing every night before bed.  Pretty generic but I personally found that "free of light" idea enlightening.  You wouldn't believe how many LEDs you have around you until you look for them. --Dc
I'm not sure how much I trust the score. One night I got an "excellent " score, still woke up feeling like trash and took a midday nap.I'm more concerned about my crazy sleep cycles.
Not sure, but don't think you can get those weekly totals or averages, except by own calculations.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
No. I tried to ask this over live chat but it just cut me off and referredme to this discussion.--Sent from my IPad. Please excuse typos,etc. Joyce
What's considered to be an 'average' sleep score?  Color me curious.

New to fitbit and having difficulty finding edit button to correct entries.
Same here!  I have also used the beginning sleep now which is more accurate as it at least captures sleep of less than one hour.  I still lose whole portions of my night though.
The Jawbone Up has a cool feature that you tell it a timeframe, and it wakes you when you would be in the best sleep pattern to wake feeling the most refreshed.  Is this an option for down the road?  This thing tracks my sleep, is on me at night, it is bluetoothed to my phone, charging on my nightstand, I just think all of the steps are here.  Jawbone is too glitzy and doesn't do as much for me.  I love my force and would love to see this feature too!
This resolution didn't solve my problem.
Not keen either - being an old fogey, I thought the change was due to user error, but now I see that the changes were planned. Hmm. Used to be obvious listing of wake and sleep and this was useful for me, but no longer as easy. Shan't renew my FB when it eventually goes pear-shaped. Change for the sake of change is not always a good plan.

@willhoft Hey! Great news! I'm so glad to hear that after the enhancements Fitbit made to the sleep tracking; you have more control over your sleep and how you feel afterwards!
 
I think this was the whole purpose of Fitbit doing those changes, for users like you to feel more comfortable while tracking sleep.

Darken your room. I use blackout curtains and don't have an alarm clock or any gadgets with a light no matter how small. The fitbit charge 2 has a vibrating alarm to wake you up (not sure of the others).Keep it quiet. Get the do not disturb app for your phone to stop any incoming notifications during set sleep hours. You can set emergency calls to get through. Closed cell door and window weather stripping around your door jamb stop will help reduce sounds coming in from the rest of the house. Upgrade to a soundproof door if your house is particularly noisy and you have the budget. If your room is full of hard surfaces like hardwood floors and bare walls try a throw rug and maybe invest in some acoustic panels to dampen the echos.Be cool. Studies show we sleep better in 61-65 F , 16-18 CGet a proper mattress. No pets in bed. I know you love them but their sleep habits end up being your sleep detriments. Consider your bedroom your sleep oasis and try to leave all your cares at the door. This is your space for you. 1/3 of your life is spent here, make the best of it.
This is today so far as it's 8pm. I went to my cardiologist and ekg. DIdnt find anything but she's ordering a holter monitor, stress test and echo, to make sure but she mentioned that she didn't see anything abnormal but based on my symptoms she's wanting to make sure.
Hi @SteviK, There are a lot of studies on this, and they all say the same thing-- electronics at night don't help in getting to sleep. One problem, as you mentioned, is that using them tends to get the mind active, which makes it harder to fall asleep. Another issue, that many don't know about, is that electronics such as phones, TVs emit a lot of blue light. And that blue light signals the body that it's still daytime. So even if your mind is being calmed by using a phone before bed, your body isn't going to get the same "wind down" signal. If you find not having those devices nearby is difficult, you can buy glasses that block the blue light, which helps quite a bit.

Yes, they should give us both...  and the option (in settings) to show or hide either of them.
I too suffer with Insomnia. What works for me is a few dropsof Lavender Essential oil on my pillow, I also use a sleep app called "Sleep Well"  http://srfcty.co/3ZIt  It has two guided meditations, one is based on tightening all your muscle groups from toe to head and relaxing them. The other focuses on using Colour 'energy' around your body. There are various background themes, music or sounds that you can add and also how long you wish it to run for anything from one hour to eight hours. Both work very well and train and condition you to relax your mind and body yo enable better sleep patterns. The other thing I use is music or natural sounds. If you Google Nigel Shaw (Echoes of the ancient forest or Dartmoor Journey) both are great albums to listen too and relax you - perfect for sleep! http://www.seventhwavemusic.co.uk/aboutus/nigel-shaw/ The final thing I use is Essential Oil of Lavender, a few drops on your pillow at night really helps. Like all things what works for one person, may or may not work for another, but what do you have to lose? Hope this helps.

I am glad to hear I'm not crazy - it is hit or miss! Have to wait 15 minutes for it to sync to see if it's in sleep mode! Not good!
Yes, I will be seeing a sleep specialist.  I tend to spend 9 hours in bed, but only get 6 hours of sleep.

Thank you for answering with such useful information, @JohnnyRow! One follow-up: are you aware of specific specific "special doings" to get those sub one-hour bursts counted? That'd be useful for the schedule I keep. (I know there's no detailed sleep data for stretches of less than 3 hours, etc.). I appreciate the help!
Funny! Because it happens to me a lot and I always trying to have a good posture during sleeping but it's really hard to remember this while sleeping. 😅

jc, welcome to FitBit. Read this article on how sleep is tracked. It might help you understand it a bit more.  click I have my settings as sensitive and on my non-dominant hand. As for my efficiency, it's never more than 75% and I'm more restless and awake than I thought, but I am a light sleeper. Keep an eye on it and if you feel you should talk with your doctor, you should. Some insurance companies have a nurse on duty that you can speak with about health concerns. Might be an idea to call and talk with her, too.

I would agree with this because I get excessive REM sleep and my mind is going nonstop during the day and hit deep sleep only 4x per night and I’m very sluggish during the day.
Go to Amazon.com and search for BitBelts.  They are inexpensive, available in many colors and do the trick.  They have them for all FitBit models.
johnvic,First, you're not a jerk, we'll let you know if you are, ha ! Welcome to the FitBit Community!  You will find a lot of nice, helpful people here.I agree with Dia and what she said. "Good sleep", long, non-restless sleep with REM periods allows your body to heal and rebuild itself.Heck, just Google search phrases like "quality of sleep", "benefits of a good night's sleep", etc.You'll get a ton of useful hits to read, much better than I can do here. Many episodes of "restlessness" during the night can point to more important issues like restless leg syndrome and sleep apniea. I personally find it no problem wearing the little Charge HR while I'm sleeping and I am personally amazed how accurate the HR is with tracking my sleep patterns.Your mileage may vary.I'd say just give it a try for a while and see for yourself. Good Luck,Rick

Here's the key question: is the Sleep Target measured against how much you sleep, total, throughout a 24-hour day (i.e., night's sleep + naps)? Or just against a single sleeping session --which I assume would generally be your nightly sleep? Longer version: My sleep schedule is to sleep X hours at night Y hours in the afternoon. The Y in the afternoon is important -- I conceive of it not as a "bonus" nap, but as part of my sleep for the day. I can't figure out: does the Fitbit app, when considering if I've reached my Sleep Target, only count the X hours at night that I slept? (Which I guess it could know to was my main "night's sleep" because it is (a) at night, and (b) longest). Or does it include my total hours, X+Y, night's rest + afternoon nap, in figuring out if I've made my Sleep Target?
I have been wearing my Fitbit on my left (non-dominant) arm on a normal sleep setting until recently, when I swtiched it to the right and sensitive setting.  When it was on the left, my sleep efficiency was usually in the mid to high 90s.  Now that I have switched it, my sleep efficiciency is in the 40s and 50s.  This is obviously a huge change and one that has me wondering about the accuracy of the Fitbit on both ends of the extreme.  Can someone explain the two different settings and why there would be such a huge discrepency in the numbers?  I am pretty sure I am not doing one handed cheerleading as the second set of numbers would suggest.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks.

Thank you. Your comments were useful but I had an interesting outcome last night and I would appreciate if you have any explanations  Large chunk of my sleep went from 10.33pm to 5.06 am Sleep score was 71 I recorded Awake 53 mins Rem 60 mins (6 episodes) Light 3hr 41 mins Deep 59 mins (4 episodes)Had a cup of tea and read something uplifting and resumed my sleep at 5.39 am and awoke at 8.06 amThe new sleep recorded which I had to edit got the same score of 71Awake 1hr 28 mins Rem 1hr 12 mins (where additional sleep actually yielded a further 36mins) Light 6 hours 23 mins  and Deep (3episodes) was reduced to 27 mins from the original 59 minsThe actual sleep should have recordedLight 68%, Rem 20% and Deep 12%The data actually says Light 67% Rem 13% Deep 5% with Awake 16%Don’t understand are you able to shed any light on this please?
When I get into bed, I may read or watch tv for an hour. Do I start the sleep function when getting into bed or when I'm ready to fall asleep? Thanks.

I would recommend sleeping more soundly, then your sleep pattern would match what your fitbit says 😜 I'm sorry I don't have a serious answer, but there is more than one way to sink a ship.
I experience the same problem with my Charge 4. Usually it works fine, but about once every 10 days it glitches out and acts like I got up hours early, or never went to bed at all. I’m on the verge of taking sleep off my dashboard display, since it so routinely infuriates me. And don’t even get me started on the sleep scores themselves….
Hiya, I've only had the Alta hr for less than a week so don't know if it's a recent problem. I suspect it's long-standing as I'm often tired no matter how much sleep I've had. That's why I got the device with sleep stages. I'll try wearing the tracker a bit tighter and lower on my wrist and also hope it's​ just a temporary issue. I need to give it longer I guess.Thanks again.Ruth
Over the last month external influences have affected my RHR.. Mainly th fluctuating Melbourne weather and temperatures. On high temperature sleep nights.. (we don't sleep with the aircons on), my RHR stabilized at 58 for 3 days and a week earlier, when it was a "blanket" night to sleep it went down to 52.. Over that time my average sleep score is 83 and a peak of 90.. The image below shows how I lose sleep score.  Because it uses yesterday's RHR I suffer in the numbers.. Fortunately this measure is only 25% of the total score.

Hi everyone.  I've listened to the bedtime story "A relaxing forest walk" three times now, and each time I've fallen asleep before it's finished.  It's narrated by a lady called Rachel, who has the most wonderful low, soothing, almost hypnotic voice.  Does anyone know where I can find more stories by Rachel?  Or who she is, whether she has a blog or website?  If you have trouble getting to sleep, give this story a try 😊.
Hi, Eric!I love weighted blankets, and my sister has used one for years.  She does a lot of the obsessive hand wringing that is typical for girls with Rett Syndrome, and sometimes she can get herself so worked up that she goes into a seizure.  But if she feels herself getting anxious we can put the weighted blanket on her and it helps calm her.As for me, I’ve been using one - but only for a few months. They can definitely help, though they’re not a cure-all. I tend to have terrible stress/anxiety-related insomnia, and with the blanket it feels a lot more manageable.
For the past few days my device  stops tracking my sleep if I get up for a reason. Example: last night I got up to go to the washroom and went right back to bed. This morning my device says I had less than 2 hours sleep.  What is going on?
Last night I went out, for the first time since I got my Fitbit.
Checking my sleep this morning, I apparently went to sleep at 10 and woke up at 7, which is pretty normal.
However, I actually didn't get home until 1, and have just got up now!!!
What's going on?
(It has logged my steps pretty well though, I hit 10k while I was on the dancefloor - at about 11!)

Janjan, thanks for sharing the numbers. Many of you mention the CPAP machine, maybe I need one as well. At least I like to have one to see if it would increse my percentage under sensitive tracking.
Did you check the help article on the matter?

Fascinating thread. I'd read about this illness-related spike in RHR, and today -- the second day into the first cold I've had since getting my FitBit last August -- I noticed it myself. I'm usually at 49-50 BPM, and yesterday it jumped to 52, and today it's at 55 BPM. The RHR spike didn't anticipate symptoms, however, but paralleled them.
My Fitbit tracker is set to the less sensitive setting, but still picks up my wife's restlesss sleep moments every night. I usually wake up once each night and get an avergae of 7.5 hours sleep.
For starters, I try to ensure that the only thing I do in my bedroom is sleep. I don't read, I don't dress there - just sleep, maybe fold some clothes when needed.Second, I try (operative word being try) to stop watching tv a couple of hours before bed. No computer, either. I read that the lights from the tv and computer screens impact our brains in some way, increasing dopamine levels if I recall correctly, and that inhibits our sleep.I also try to avoid food 3 hours before bedtime, and my last drink of water is 2 hours before bedtime.I've also read that the light from my alarm clock can disturb sleep, so I have it on my dresser instead of my nightstand. Aside from those tips, avoid caffiene and other stimulants, try to keep your workouts at least 3 hours before your bedtime, as the elevated heat your body feels after a workout can slow your ability to relax.

@Sleeper_Awakens  A post from @davidh1 will fix it. He said "Go to the log / sleep area, click on EDIT, (like you were going to adjust the start/end time) and without changing anything click on "update".  It will re-calculate the sleep efficiency." It does work. I used it to fix my own sleep log for the past few days. Welcome to the forums.

why does my sleep chart sometimes shows the old chart that I had?  Not the rem, light and deep
The tryout is only a glimpse of what is offered. So it's news to me that calorie burn can't be adjusted then. What else an I getting and losing if I don't continue with it?I'm reluctant to pay for it, because I'm not interested in most of the properties that are offered. Like the caloric burn. They are only funny numbers that I get with it.And I'm even more reluctant to get the coach, because I'm using, in my opinion, the best coaching fitness application there is. The freeletics coach. And I'm paying for it.So if there's a reason you know what the app would give me and I wouldn't have to get the coach, then I'm interested.

Hi guys. Ok so me and my friend have the same Charge HR. The sleep tracker on mine works fine and is accurate. I have a toddler that wakes at night and I always have bad sleep. Its the one with the few thin blue lines (5h18) and I know is correct. My friend sleeps great, he takes meds and is knocked out all night, he's rested and feels good but he constantly gets these weird patterns that are full of thick blue lines all night (4h25), there is no way he is sleeping that little. What is happening? He is a tummy sleeper if that matters, is he wearing it wrong, something else? We thought it was just defective but I switched Fitbits with him and we got the same thing. So its how he is wearing it or how he is sleeping... Correct (mine): [IMG]http://i68.tinypic.com/241oytj.png[/IMG] Messed up (his):[IMG]http://i65.tinypic.com/2me22p5.png[/IMG] Any idea what could be causing this and how to get him to have accurate readings? Thanks!
You had exactly my question. Did you ever get an answer? In a 7.5 hour night, I sometimes have 170 - 190 "restless" minutes. Only 5-7 episodes, no awake periods show, but way more than the 25-30 minutes they say is "normal."I take no sleep aids. But because of my restless periods my fitbit subtracts 3 hours and calls my sleep 3-4 hours. Do I have a problem?!? (2 years ago my restless periods were not as long.)

Hi @ttrani01, You can adjust the start and stop times of a sleep period, in the app. Just open up the sleep for a particular day, and click the pencil icon to edit the times.

They all basically work the same for sleep tracking. The wrist worn trackers do it automatically, the clip-on One needs to be worn on your wrist and manually started / stopped. There's a FAQ on the sleep tracking that may help at https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314/ As they are all similar for sleep tracking then your choice may be driven by other features. There's a good comparison chart at www.fitbit.com/compare

I'm new to fitbit and all the feedback information it provides about my sleep, restlessness and activity but I'm not sure how I benefit from knowing I had 29 restless moments last night.  What do I do with this information?
@tallullah hey there. If that is the only instances that it occurred, I would chalk it up to a bad reading from your tracker or you really did have a fitful sleep that you just don't remember. If things have been good since, I think you are a-OK. 

Elena | Pennsylvania
Do not make much of it. First it is some form of average and you have no access to the underlying data. What you need to look at is the trend, does it decrease, does it increase ? Not much more. And I am not sure you can see more than 7 days of data. On 30 days mine are quite erratic.
I have low blood pressure as well pretty much the same during the day but at night it gets very low apparently. I also do the dozing off thing I am not sure if its micro sleep caused by some condition or if it is just that my sleep quality is poor. And I am not sure if my sleep quality is poor because of some medical issue or if it is related to stress or something. Do you have sleep paralysis too? I remember once as a kid I was playing with a friend during a sleepover and I fell asleep and was unresponsive to her when she called to me but I kept moving the toy in my hand and so she didn't know I was sleep at first until she looked at me and tried having a conversation with me. When I do look up some of this stuff narcolepsy pops up
Hi @Alicat2104, What you're seeing as far as efficiency was from the old sleep model. Sleep stages doesn't currently contain that information. Depending on which tracker you have, there may be a way to switch back when you need it.

For some reason reading always wakes me up and I simply must keep turning the pages to find out what happens next. However listening to an audiobook eliminates this problem, I think because I'm not physically moving. It got so bad that I had to stop listening on my way to sleep because I was missing huge chunks of story.In light of this I play white noise from my phone. I play mine from my Sleep Android app (favouring thunderstorm) but there are several thousand white noise tracks on youtube. Alternatively spoken meditation tracks can be handy if you're having trouble getting to sleep but I'm the girl that always falls asleep at the end of the yoga class so I seem to be susceptible to that sort of thing.Moral of the story is I would have a much harder time getting to sleep if I turned off all my devices.
@euboean We would expect you to see lights on the Flex any time it enters/exits Sleep Mode. If you aren't seeing that, try giving your device a restart: https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1041329 and contact our Support Team at http://contact.fitbit.com if the issue persists.
@tkcornbred Thank you for confirming. Are the gaps constant? What is the cadence of the gaps, daily? Weekly?
 
Also, please share a screenshot of the online Dashboard's sleep tracking and also any other days with gaps. That will be useful in looking into your specific instance. Thank you for helping me gather more info from you.

Erick | Community ModeratorIt's all about the food! What's Cooking?
When I use to go to my dashboard, my sleep was automaticlly logged. When I went to where I could log sleep, there was the place that I manually could enter it and below was where it showed the data after it was snyced that I could edit. This morning all I have is where I can enter the data manually, there is not section showing from my band what I slept. What happened, what did I do and how do I get it back to automatically get the data from my band?
Thanks for the tips..but i want to tell you the story of my friend. I can say he is gifted and has a miracle within him. He can drink a cup of coffee before going to bed and sleep peacefully. LoL... Me? If i drink coffee after 6 pm, i will not fall asleep until maybe 2 3 am. Or even the worse case, if i drink coffee during the night, i will not feel sleepy at all until tomorrow morning...
I might of found my answer in “Fit is the new Skinny”... due to my calorie burn and activity level of >6 hours per week I need to up my calories as my BMR adjusted for same is approximately 2760 so I appear to be eating way too little...any comments welcome 😀
I also noticed the Fitbit Surge is useful during sleep to know when something is going on.  I had a bad episode of heartburn one night that woke me up. (I take Nexium and I forgot it).  My heart rate spiked and sustained for almost an hour AND the other thing that tells me something is wrong when I sleep is the active minutes measured by calories burned.  While I can't find the detailed heart rate data like I have in the app, I do have the calories burned in the log. This morning I felt tired when I woke up like I didn't sleep well.  I got a normal amount of sleep for me but when I looked at the "active minutes" I had 26 minutes within an hour of getting up and looking further it was at 1:30ish in the morning when I was fast asleep! Or so I thought. Makes me wonder what happened. No heart burn this time. The Fitbit is great for insight like this. I look at data all the time (engineer) and I am formerly a paramedic, so I am figuring out new things to use it for frequently.  This is almost like having a medical grade heart monitor on all the time. Things I never knew about are coming to light now.
Out of all the fit bit products which one is most accurate and recommended for sleep tracking?

See if there's a TV show you like that's on at that time and do strength moves while watching it. I've recently gotten into doing squats in the place of the housewide pacing I usually do when bored. My buns will thank me soon!
I currently use SnoreLab, which is useful but does not link to FitBit. It would be helpful to be able to match my snoring behaviour with sleep phases.I also monitor my blood pressure using Omron Evolv, which also does not link to FitBit.  Not sure what the immediate benefit would be, except that it would be helpful to have al of my data in one place.Both SnoreLab and Omron link to Apple Health, which suggests that I should swap my Charge 3 for an Apple Watch and Aria scales for an Apple-compliant alternative.  But I do not really want to do that, I like the Fitbit products and I have a lot of data on the FitBit dashboard that I do not want to lose.Why can't FitBit step up to the plate and develop links to SnoreLab and/or Omron?
I'd be actually interested in the same thing. Why cannot Fitbit integrate smart alarm function into their bands? Come on Fitbit, it can't be that difficult when you already have the data....
That isn't always correct.  It takes me between 20 to 45 minutes if at all to fall asleep.  I'm a cronic insomniac. Whether I wear my mask or not I normally feel tired and it takes me the same length of time (roughly) to sleep.  The big difference is when I wake.  If I use my machine I'm headache free - without it I have awful headaches.  Mind you I haven't tried the Fitbit without the machine - the comparison might be interesting.

Same here, except mine has gone from approximately 6 hours/night to saying I'm sleeping 11, 11.5, even 12 hours a night. I'm not, and I'm not sitting quietly during that time either. I can't edit it, because I can only edit individual nights, and those are registering accurately. There are other problems too, and rebooting hasn't helped, so I'm getting close to calling it quits.
Hi
I"ve read a few places and from a moderator that 'Just note that the sleep stages won't be generated since you're using the Fitbit app instead of your watch to track your sleep.' I use this because I thought I had to and have gotten detailed logs although not every night.  So should you or should you not use the begin sleep now on the app?

Hi Elleyalater, Having looked very deeply into sleep and what it does and doesn't do, you will be surprised to learn that fitbit gives you an excellent understanding of how much sleep you get. Of course it is not as good as going to a sleep clinic, but I don't have the time to do that 'every' day! What I discovered very early on is that I can tell my midday if I have slept well. If I then check my fitbit I find that I have had over 90 minutes of sleep, the recommended amount needed to get to REM. Meaning it must be doing a very good job. If I feel tired and then check I find I have not managed a 90 minute session. If you suffer with poor sleep, give it a try. Monitor your sleep, see how you feel later in the day then check your fitbit data. Best regards Chris
I don't know about others, but to me there is no "normal". Some nights there might be 25 times restless or awake, and other nights, like last night, there were only 2 times restless or awake.
You can check and see if your sleep was logged on your dashboard. If you were still in sleep mode or hadn't entered into sleep mode, there would be no record of it in today's log. From the Fitbit app dashboard, tap the tracker tile.Tap the tracker for which you want to set an alarm.Tap Silent Alarms.Tap Set a New Alarm.Select the alarm time and frequency, and don’t forget to save. The app should sync with your tracker immediately.
I’m also a day ahead. How to fix?
@fitbip If you take @Itw post image and swipe to the Awake display you will find when you tap on those small red spikes you can get 0, 1, 2 & 3 mins  awake. Also when you examine a daily sleep graph and tap on Benchmark you will see how you stand to the population. Your can then calculate the time, and in my case it equates to the total Awake time.

I have had my Versa 2 for a month. At first, all readings worked. Now I am unable to get a reading on the sleep mode on my device, which has been selected in the settings. It's as if the sleep mode is not syncing with my phone. How do I correct this?
Does anyone know of any other options for the wrist band?  It scratches my wrist and I am very aware of it all night long, end up taking it off half way through the night, defeating its purpose.  Maybe a smaller band or one that's not so rough? Ideas?
How long have you had the Blaze? Could you post a screenshot of the nights that are in "pieces"?
I have exactly the same issue.  It renders the sleep function useless.  I'm using an older model (Charge 2), could that be part of the problem?  I there a setting to change somewhere.  I consistently sleep 11 to 7, but it seems to only record from around 4am (when I get up to pee).
I’ve woken up at 7.41am today, the time as writing this is 8.11am, according to my Fitbit I woke up at 8.33am today. How is it possible for the app to say a time which hasn’t even been reached yet? The time on my iPhone and the Fitbit itself are correct
Hi Guys, I have been using the ALTA Hr for a while now and my question is simple-- On days when I am in bed for almost 8 hours, the device shows my sleep to be say 7 hours 10 mins and 50 mins of ' being awake'. Its always the case. I try logging in 7 hours of sleep by trying to be in bed from 11- 6 daily, and yet my sleep time shows as 6 hrs 10 mins or so.  really want to tell myself that I am sleeping the minimum-- 7 hours-- what data is correct? I am pretty sure I cant remember a thing abt times when fitbit says I am awake, and I have always spent my life thinking 7 hours in bed= 7 hours in asleep-- assuming I know I fell asleep as I hit the bed that is. Is it really a must for me to be in bed - asleep for 8 hours for fitbit to tell me that I am doing the 7 hour minimum? Or do I be okay with 6 hours ++ amount of sleep that according to fitbit I get daily?
Neither does mine and it just started doing that. Anyone know how to fix it??

I am the same way. Sometime my Versa 2 works the way its supposed to and just shows that i'm awake when going to the bathroom, but lately almost every night when i get up at about 2 am it shuts off thinking i'm up for the day. I just go to the bathroom, then wash hands then back to bed and fast asleep. But in the morning it shows it stopped at 2 am and because i didn't get 4 hrs of sleep, it only shows sleep pattern of when i'm asleep and when i'm awake. No stages (Rem, light, or deep sleep).I think you have to have 3 or 4 hours of sleep in order to get your stages Rem, light, or deep to show up. Hope this can be fixed in an upcoming update.
Hi, @SteveH , thanks for your reply and the link, which has cleared up some things for me. Looking at it again, the graph doesn't actually have a labelled y-axis, so I'm thinking maybe it only measures variations and not exact values, and displays them in two ways (ie colour coded and the graph going up and down). Either way, the sample graph used in the article looks fairly similar to mine, so I won't worry about it.
Do I need to subscribe to premium to get detailed sleep tracking? Amazon reviews are confusing on this.

Hi @YojanaFitbit. It's always a pleasure! 😁
 
The same happens to me. When I don't sleep well, I feel tired, out of sorts 😶
 
See you around.

Hello @Debs0216  This should be easy: in your Fitbit app on your phone, tap Edit in the right corner, then simply scroll to the bottom and you should see your sleep tracking there. Just tap on the Add button.
But not at a glance. Buried in the menus. You nerfed functionality to pressure people into buying premium.
I'm no noob.I've had my fitbit since 2016 and I've been using the sleep insights for at least 18 months, since I got my Blaze.I don't find the insights inaccurate.My experience with the 'score' has been the opposite to yours, the lower the score, the better the sleep. Or alternatively, the highest scores have represented the worst nights sleep.I think this 'score' is a gimick, and I don't see what it's based on.
I routinely roll from my left side, to my back, to my right side, and then reverse the process; I probably do the circuit at least eight or ten times on a night.  Each time I change position my Fitbit logs the movement as "Restless".
Yes! I came to the forums purely to see if this -or something similar- had been discussed.I wish I could set my Fitbit to 8 hours of sleep, and that it would wake me up during the first light sleep period AFTER those 8 hours had been met.
To whom are you responding?
This is something I also would like to have. Also, it would be good to be able to rate the quality of sleep, since the feeling is very different from night to night. My fitbit gives me a very high point on sleeping since I sleep so many hours, but I still wake up some mornings still feeling tired.
@SantiR I thought the idea of singing to yourself sounded really weird, but I gave it a go. I gotnall the way through 10 Green Bottles, decided it wasnt working, but moved on to on the First Day of Christmas (another long repetative song) and then I woke up this morning lol. So maybe it is not so weird after all. I'll try it again tonight!

My FitBit tells me I average about 15 - 29 awakenings during the night.  Looking at the graph showing sleep stages the 'awake' points are obvious - short red point way at the top.  Today there were 23 of them according to FitBit. This is measured I assume by my respiration and heart rate increasing.  Of course I remember only 3 of them the rest not arousal enogh to be noticed.  EDIT : I am 78 y ears old in good health and use a full face CPAP.
I updated to flex 2 recently, but found my sleep pattern  changed to much less hour everyday.I tested with both flex and flex 2, and both Fitbit are on my wrist, and result came out totally diff.The flex 2 tells me 6h 50m, but flex tells me 8h 58m. So...which one is telling the truth ? I don't know if Fitbit is really a good device to track my sleep pattern now, I lost...
Edit: this is without drinking alcohol/meds. I drink only coffee in the morning
@mikeyyc I'm glad to continue helping you to understand your sleep pattern!I can't tell you at what intensity or other movements but when your Flex indicates that you are moving so much that restful sleep would not be possible, your sleep graph will indicate that you were awake.  Flex will differentiate when you're awake or restless as you can see in your sleep graph that gives you results of restless, awake and asleep. A restless state of sleep indicates that your body transitioned from a very restful position with little movement to movement, such as turning over in bed. This doesn't necessarily mean that you were fully awake or cognizant of your movements, but it may indicate that you were not getting the most restful sleep possible at that time. When you click on the gear icon of the sleep tile, you'll see for how many minutes you were awake and restless. Also, the sleep graph will provide you with the specific time you were awake or restless and it will give you the total amount of hours you were asleep.  Let me know if you have further questions

What sleep apps do you use and why? I have found Alarmy to be a life saver due to my sleep disorder, Narcolepsy. I can customize the snooze settings to wake up in three minutes, crank the volume, etc, giving me the most effective alarm clock I have ever owned.
I like listening to stuff like John Maus (Hey moon is one of my favorites), Ween, Joy Division, and Pink Floyd (Pigs on the Wing) anything that is relaxing, really. It's tough to really nail "genre" down because alot of artists can put out both bombastic and chill tracks. I made a playlist on youtube, but I'm always adding to it. If I can make a non music suggestion, The podcast "Sleep With Me" is perfect and I have yet to stay awake for an entire episode, which is the point lol. I've been listening to him for years too, so hes got a solid track record with me. Each episode starts off coherent, hell give thanks to listeners, go through reddit posts, talk about a tv show hes watching, maybe talk about something from his daily life. Sometimes hell do a guided meditation, but around halfway through he will start rambling and making less and less sense. great stuff.
For me, it's just the notion of being tired enough to fall asleep and having enough time to sleep. But such is life.

HiSomeone help!! Say... I slept 9 hours and 50 minutes....on another sync it'll say 7hrs 45 mins... now I'm another think it'll say 9 hours and 50 minutes long story short every sink I get a different sleep numbers..why?!? I just called Fitbit again and they said I'm not the only one with this issue is anybody else having this issue and can somebody help figure out why please?!Thanks, Ashley....its driving me nuts!
I initially set my sleep to sensitive. My # times awake averaged about 14 and efficiency in the 70 - 80's. My time to fall asleep was between 20 and 45 minutes.I set it to normal and starting taking melatonin before bed. I average in the high 90% for efficiency and my number of times awake has dropped to between 2 - 8. My time to fall asleep is between 5 - 7 minutes, usually.My best efficiency rating was a two hour nap on a Sunday. No times awake 🙂
Thank you Salegh. I agree with you that more research needs to be done. It’s either some type of electromagnetic frequency that messes with the brain or potentially, the light emitted by the heart rate monitor if the device is not perfectly glued to the skin. It could be psychological, but I truly doubt it. Either way, I will keep evaluating and will post any updates.
The awake/restless is picked up by movement. So, if you roll over, or move your arms at all it will register. I may wake up once during the night to go to the restroom. It also tends to pick up some restless periods that I don't remember, but they are short.   Any chance you are sleep walking?
We have the same problem, and my new Fitbit has confirmed why I am so exhausted.  I don't want to sleep in another room either....
how close do you need to keep your phone in order for the fitbit to work
I am doing a science fair project, and using Fitbits to test the sleep quality of gamers vs. non-gamers.  I need the following information, for three consecutive nights.  These are easily found in the sleep log and on the summary screen for sleep in the App on Iphone.  If you would be wiling to send me data, and the answers to the following very simple questions, I would be most appreciative!  You could post answers here, or email them to my dad at 900grant@gmail.com.  Thank you! Q1: How often do you play video games?  0 hours/week, 1-3 hours/week, 4-5 hours/week, 5+ hours/week.Q2: Most likely game to play: Animal Crossing (virtual stimulation); Minecraft (survival), Call of Duty (1st person shooter), Legend of Zelda (Strategic role-play).Q3:  Are you under 21 (youth or young adult) or over 21 (adult). Date:sleep efficiency:Went to bed (time):Time to fall asleep (m):Times awakened:In bed for:Actual Sleep time:Minutes awake:Times awake:Minutes Restless:Times Restless:
I can't find where to set the new sleep schedule feature, please help. There is no additional tile appearing on my dashboard, nor is one available to load. I have the Charge HR, and received the New Feature email.Thanks,Louise
I set my fitbit for sleep when I go to bed and when I awake for the day I tap it to take it out of sleep mode.When it syncs with my computer or ipad, it just shows what time I started it and stopped it  eg, 22:57 - 6:57 = 8h I know that I was up at least twice diring the night but it is just a solid blue line.  Can you help me?
That’s exactly it, @dave_in_ni ! Try that when you’re awake too early. See if that gets you back to sleep easier.
Why does the charge 3 show sleep not tracked on the fitbit?
Thanks Marci, My Inspire 2 is very often showing my 'sleep start' time as 1-2 hours later than reality. I just tried it, and it worked.  I manually edited my sleep start time to something more realistic, and it showed a whole bunch of REM and deep sleep that otherwise it didn't count. Are there tricks or techniques to get the fitbit to have a better chance of capturing my 'go to sleep' time?  Is it really all about heart rate?  I lay still and am asleep pretty quickly after going to bed...what can I do differently to help it find my real sleep start time?
Having read the information about getting regular sleep I have set a regular time on my Fitbit to go to bed and get up in the morning and have found after a few days of going to bed around the same time I am getting to sleep quicker and I am waking up naturally before the alarmSent from my iPhone
Hi @felicity1169 It's a little hard to answer, because "normal" has a pretty wide range depending on the person. Your screenshots are showing up a little small, but it looks like your awake time is about an hour per night. If so, that's fairly normal. According to a study of Fitbit users, the average is 7 hours 33 minutes in bed, and 6 hours 38 minutes of actual sleep.There are many factors that can contribute to tiredness besides sleep--hormones, stress, diet, etc. You can follow up with your doctor to help hone in on what's going on. Best of luck.

Hello, My oxygen variation charts remain in the low part of the chart but zig zag all over the place, sometimes nearly touching the bottom line.. is thus normal? What does good look like?
Hi @paulkinzelman, If you're not seeing the sleep tile on the home screen of the app, you may have to add it. At the bottom, select the Edit button. Then you can add the sleep tile.

If your sleep log shows many instances of waking or disturbance, it might be sensible to be checked for sleep apnea, even if you don't have the usual risk factors such as obesity, falling asleep suddenly during the day, etc. I wasn't aware of being a sufferer until I entered a new relationship with my now husband who was alarmed at the way I stopped breathing in the night, many times. l'd learned to live with it. Untreated, you has a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. Treatment, I have to admit is a real pain, but better than the consequences. Diagnosis is done by way of a sleep test where you are hooked up to multiple sensors and then try to sleep, not easy I can tell you. But necessary to assess the degree of seriousness, the type of apnea (there are several which are treated differently) and to eliminate things like 'restless leg' syndrome.
I had a similar issue--my sleep score, hear rate, etc. icons wouldn't allow me to access the data as usual (stats over time, etc.) so I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. Now there's none of my data from the months and months of tracking I had access to on my app and online dashboard. Can it be recovered? This is extraordinarily frustrating.
Not that I've noticed. What are you seeing?
There is nothing to set up.  Fitbit detects sleep automatically.

Hi @Roseduzk   for me, it's lavender. Here is a link to a place I like - click to go there. It's got a lot you can read about the various oils and blends. I was gifted with their spray and it's got a light scent that I put on my pillowcase and on my sheets. You can get a plain oil or you can get a blend of oils. It's fun to experiment with and oils last a long time. To make my own spray, I use about 5 ounces of water, 1 ounce of cheap vodka (it acts to stabilize the oil) and 15 or so drops of oil. When the bottle gets low, I just add to it. Sometimes I put in some drops of another oil for a whole other scent. Let us know what you end up doing.

I would try setting your device to the sensitive sleep setting to see if that helps. You seem to have done all the normal troubleshooting steps, hopefully this one will clear it up. Here's how you do it: In the Fitbit app, tap the Today tab , then tap your profile picture.Tap Advanced Settings. Sleep Sensitivity and make your changes.

I have my setting on normal.  I am 54 and my average sleep time is 7 hrs, (total time in bed 7.5 hrs)  and my efficiency is 91-97.And I can usually tell the difference between a 91 and 96. For me, what I notice is not necessarily the times restless (as it can be just changing a postion) but that I have a block of uninterrupted sleep for 2 hrs or more. Those are the mornings I wake up feeling rested. I have been tracking sleep for about a month.
@Makinthemagic thanks for sharing your story with us. It sounds like consistent or high quality sleep has been challenging for you. But, it also sounds like you've done tons of research and tried lots of new things! Have you tried any herbal remedies or teas like chamomile or those night time teas?
 
Very curious to hear what you get back from the doctor or sleep doctor. I hope you circle back and let us know, as I'm sure others in the community may have had similar challenges!
I have the Charge HR.
If you are talking about on the semicircle graph to the right of heart rate, the gray area is when you were awake, apparently from 5:45 AM until 1:35 PM.  It is showing two sleeps periods and the awake time in between.

In the Fitbit App, click on the sleep tile.Then click the night you want info for.Then scroll down and you see a bar with     Last Night | 30 Day Avg | BenchmarkClick on Benchmark.You will then see your benchmark info.
I got up 2 nights ago, sat and read in the living room for 2 hours, apparently with my left hand (wearing flex) motionless most of the time. That time was logged as sleep. But, in general, I think over time, flex records sleep fairly well.

I'm not really sure what you mean. All the data you could previously see is still there. See below, the first screenshot is using the standard HR chart which was available before premium (and still is)  Below is what is included with Premium (and was never available previously). As you can see the Premium version is more detailed, but the point is, the version that existed before premium still exists and is accessible by non premium users.

Years ago I went to a hypnotist who played a recording of ocean waves and after the huge group of people were hypnotized he said things like, "you don't need cream in your coffee".  I like to go to sleep listening to a cd recording of rain better.  I read it isn't important for you to go to sleep, you just need to be completely relaxed.  If you can accept this as true, out takes off all the pressure.    Relax your face....your jaw.  An expert said it is better to sleep on your side.  If you put a fat pillow beside you, you can put your top leg on it, which is very comfortable.  If you are going to drink alcohol, the earlier the better  because it is a diuretic and you will have to get up in the night to go to the bathroom.  Another weird suggestion I read was that you should use the smallest pillow you can be happy with.  That surprised me even though I made my pillow which is 8 inches long, 5 inches wide and 3 inches thick.  It is like a soft little brick and fits nicely at the back of my neck or just above my ear and it doesn't mess up my hair.  I definetely would hate a pillow I sank into.  You could tear up an old pillow and try a little one?
I went to my Fitbit app on my iPhone and updated the app and after updating the heart rate graph was working this morning.  Thank you Wilsonfitbit
I definitely saw a dramatic increase in my sleep effeciency numbers when I upgraded to the Charge HR.  The One consistently gave me 84 to 87% sleep effeciency, and the CHR gives me 92 to 95%.  I don't think my actual sleep is that much better, so I was wondering if other people who had switched had experienced a similar change.
I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder last year. Let’s just say it was rough year but I’ve had a lot of improvement since, but still struggle with low periods. I’ve had a Fitbit charge 3 for a couple months now. My favorite feature is waking up and seeing my sleep patterns, they are always interesting, because they change drastically from week to week and with mood cycles. My average for REM last month was 15% and my deep sleep was a sad 8% (both stats are lower than average). But what’s been really interesting is that I go into REM sleep first, rather than deep sleep. I started looking into this, and according to research, people suffering from depression tend to have early onset REM and often too much.Even when they are in remission.*Last week I had a low week leading upto my  menstrual cycle (which always zaps me into a deeper low). Sure enough my REM sleep was very active and early and deep was very low. Following the conclusion of my cycle, I started following a more “normal” pattern with deep sleep initiating first and REM coming later. My deep sleep amounts are terrible tho, last night I clocked lovely 12 min and that was following a late night out the previous night. Besides the low deep sleep, I noticed my mood is better and I believe it shows in my the sleep data.Anyone else seeing swings like this?
That's good to know, thanks very much.
Keep a constant bedtime and wake time. Get early morning sun, at least 30 minutes, an hour if possible.  In the evening after sunset stay away from blue lights, which you get from TV's , Cell phones, PC's, etc. Install f.lux on your PC/Tablets/IPAD, use blue blockers if you must look at your phone or PC after sunset. For the last hour before bed, read and relax, meditate if possible. Be in bed by 10pm. The most restorative sleep is between 10pm and 2am.  Try grounding daily. Avoid sugars, dairy and grains if possible. No lights in your room. Absolute darkness. All lights should be red lights or dimmed lights after sunset. Lastly, don't worry about sleep, just let it happen. Best regards.
If you want to see previous sleep log in Normal or Sensitive -  Go to the Log, and the Sleep page. If you hover the mouse over the sleep record, and Edit option with appear. Select it, and in the lower left of the edit view that appears there is an option to change to Normal or Sensitive depending on what it is already in. Click on that and it will update your sleep record to show it in the selected sensitivity.  Not sure if it is possible to do more than one at a time unfortunately.
I’m having problems too. Both my app & versa are up to date so that’s not the issue.
Making progress.
That's in normal range for sleeping overnight; the higher range is for daytime awake.

A cup of mint tea and listening to some soft music. Try not to take the worries of the day into your bedroom. Life's stresses can keep you up, even when you're not dwelling on them. Some research has stated that the bedroom ought to be a place to sleep and not get into a discussion that might lead to an argument, watch tv or talk on the phone. You'll learn what works best for you now that you're aware of it.

I have the charge 2 hr, which has the sleep stage pattern. I think this feature is really nice but I question it's accuracy. Often times my fitbit will register that I was in a "light sleep" stage when I am relaxing before bed (reading, watching TV, etc...). I am sure this has happened to everyone at some point, it happened with the old sleep tracking as well. When this occurs, in the morning when I check my sleep graph, I will often edit my sleep start time to reflect the (around) the actual time I went to sleep. Often times when I do this, my sleep stages change. For example a portion of my graph that was in "light sleep" could become "REM sleep" or "deep sleep"; if I change the start time again, it will again change. I reckon when you edit your sleep times, the Fitbit software is re-evaluating the sleep "block" and then making best guesses as to what stage you were in at either time, so each edit is a new opportunity for the Fitbit software to make those guesses. What I don't understand is that if my sleep start time was 11:30pm or 12:13 am, why it would think I was in light sleep vs rem or vice versa at one given point in time... It seems like the stages are more guesstimates than people are assuming. PS - the new "awake" metric is pretty poor in my experience. A lot of us are now getting absurd "awake" times compared to the old sleep tracking system (even with sensitivity set properly) EDIT: I wanted to include some screenshots. While this isn't the best example of what I am describing it shows what I mean. Sleep stages before edit (note time frame)Sleep stages after edit (not new deep sleep stage)
Everybody is confused by it! This is what Fitbit say: Taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2437.htm

I've had an Alta HR for quite awhile.  When the sleep score feature was added, it consistently worked and was quite helpful.  Recently I had to stop wearing the Fitbit for a week.  After I put it back on several weeks ago,  I haven't seen the sleep score since.  I tried the suggestions -- tighten the band, fully charge the battery, check settings, etc.  No luck.  Now I'm suspecting one of two possibilities.....either Fitbit has a "retail motive" hoping customers buy a newer model....or, more likely, there has been a recent unsuccessful software update to the app or the device.
I don't wear it to bed either. As a person who has suffered from anxiety and insomnia, i make a very conscious effort to not think or dwell on any sleep issues. Even typing this is risky. I want nothing to draw my brain into thinking about sleeping. i stick to my routine. if it ain't broke......
Our (my gf and I's) Inspire 2s just started having the issue as well. I'll spare you the support schpiel about putting it on your non-dominant hand and disconnecting/reconnecting to bluetooth because it's clearly a widespread issue not your device. But I did reboot mine earlier today and so hopefully it will properly track tonight's sleep.
@mem958 what specifically isn't working? What have you tried to fix the issue? Have you contacted support? This will help a moderator or someone on the council to better address your concerns.

My sleep pattern tracking hasn't worked the past 3 nights.  It tracks the amount of time I went to sleep but it stopped tracking the number of times I was awake or restless.  Does anyone know why this has stopped and how I can get it work again?
I rebooted my actually watch but what I didn't do was delete the App from my iPhone and then re-install .... once I did this it worked. And you don't lose any data by deleting the App either which is what I was worried about. Good luck x

Jean -- I have most of my heart rate data. What I have is that there are a couple of particular nights that I am very interested in and have looked at the graphs many times, and now when I look at the graphs they are blank. (I had a sleep study in November, a sleep study 2 weeks ago, a really bad positional apnea night a month ago, and a cluster of apneas a couple of days after Thanksgiving.) Up until a couple of days ago, I had data on all those graphs, and I have screen shots of both of them. All of the other nights which I have only looked at a few times the data is still there.I can't tell if this is the same problem you guys are having or something different.
ok, this was my first night also so hopefully it starts working for me too.
@WyldHaggis, This answer assumes you are male. If you are not, there may be other mechanisms for women. If you used to sleep through the night without urinating, then more frequent urination is cause for some concern. As long as men produce testosterone, their prostate enlarges. Eventually, it presses on the urethra and prevents complete emptying of the bladder. Occasionally, cancer forms in the prostate, which causes it to swell. You can get a PSA test, but these have false positives and negatives. To collect data, I start a workout when I get in bed. Then the trips to the bathroom register as an increased heart rate. The next day, I measure the "P to P times. Just doing this may resolve your problem as Hawthorne's Law says that things that are tracked tend to improve. I've always gotten up during the night, but the intervals are increasing because of my diet.  (* diet described at end) About the time people start to urinate more often, they often start to get erectile dysfunction. Most men should wake up with an erection. If not, then the blood vessel leading to the **ahem** is starting to get blocked. This is one of the earliest symptoms of developing heart disease. The other one is a slipped disc in L5-L6 (the lower back.) Don't panic. The heart attack is likely decades away when these first happen. I'm certain everything I've written is correct, but there is no reason for you to believe some 64-year-old guy you don't know. I suggest watching "Forks Over Knives" on Netflix for an overview. Then Dr. T. Collin Campbell's book "The China Study - the Revised and Expanded Edition. Also explore books by Drs. Esselstyne, Ornish, McDougall and McGregor. Visit their websites and watch their video. After you have done this, schedule an annual physical if you can.  If you just want a band-aide approach, call your doctor and get a prescription for a drug that will make you pee less often. However, it only treats the symptom, not the cause. *There is only one way of eating that has been scientifically proven to prevent, arrest and reverse most of the top 15 causes of death. They could be collected under the heading "Nutritional Diseases.) The way of eating is simple:1. No animal products. 2. No added oils like olive oil, etc.3. Food should look pretty much in its natural state.4. Most of the calories come from starches.5. Lots of cruciferous vegetables for vitamins. 6. No protein supplements. (I added this because of people's interests. They are harmful.) Obviously, no junk food.

Did you find a solution? When we first got the bed it synced with my Versa, but it hasn’t for quite a while. I unpaired and re-paired, but still no luck. I don’t remember exactly when it stopped syncing, but I think it was around the time FitBit started using a sleep “score” too.
My charge 2 record all my naps, not that I have so many but it always record me having naps even if its under one hour. It's not accurate down to the minute, but I experience the same thing at morning- the tracker thinks I'm asleep for five to ten minutes after I get ut. I must be very sleepy in the morning  according to my FitBit. 😜
Cheers @MDadourian! Yeah.. I certainly pay 100% attention to what my legs are saying when I contemplate a run. I often walk at times if I am feeling a bit shakey and even though I've done a 10k event in a surprisingly well time, I do want to make sure I am injury free. I've not thought about the long term effects of high impact exercise though, however I probably don't do it enough for it to be a problem.  Just joined http://www.5x50.org/ event that starts on Sunday! Went to my first spin class today, which was interesting. I think on the whole it is important to mix high with low impact training. I've done quite well this week with both my circuits, running on cross trainer seems like lowish impact training, spin & swimming on top of run club oh and a body combat class. Next week won't quite go as "exercise smoothly"  thanks to other commitments, but I am skiing this weekend 🙂   The book is quite a good read, only read a small bit, but it certainly helps with the inspiration. Yes, pleased to say my shin issues haven't come back since my vivobarefoot/vibram shoes and I was given different exercises to avoid any strain during sprinting.  Ah thank you, it helps to share the information and hear positive feedback. I just wish I had more time in a day to do more exercise. Hope all is well with you 🙂 I look forward to doing my Park Run 5k again next weekend and see how I get on, but perhaps not to pressurize a PB of 26.23 unless my legs/feet are ready for it. I am often still wondering "Am I running right.." However I had a wee practise on the treadmill when I bought some brilliant earphones (perfect for small ears!) and I was stoked that I was running on the balls of my feet without even focusing too hard on it. YAY. Slowly getting there..

I can only stay asleep for an average of 5 hours a night. Once in a while I'll take an afternoon nap. I'm a notorious night owl trying to get into the habit of shutting off the lights at about the same time every night. Going to see how my FitBit tracks my new habit. Maybe my sleep will get better with this consistency.
So my office is really into Fitbit step challenges. We have good groups that participate consistently. We are also workaholics who are often at work into the night. Would Fitbit consider creating sleep challenges to go along with the step challenges ? Maybe something like who can consistently hit their sleep goals ? It would do a lot to encourage good sleep practices in a fun way, I think.

Hi @sakshimaeher, Sleep tracking is automatic. Nothing to turn on. The times you're referring to serve as a target sleep time, so you can compare your actually sleep patterns to the target. It's on one of the screens in the app under Sleep. There's a separate setting where you can get a notification a certain amount of time before what you've set as the sleep start target. Usually if you don't get this, it's because notifications got turned off. If you page through the screens on the tracker, you'll find one called Notifications. Press and hold the side button to turn it on, or off.

Thanks for the article. I would like to see the ability to compare my sleep to others who use the same setting, sensitive or regular. I think since I use the sensitive setting I can't really tell how I compare to others. Is that a planned change or improvement?

http://www.sleepcycle.com/howitworks.htmlWe have digressed. I only mentioned SleepCycle Alarm Clock as an example of functionality I'd like to see in the FitBit.
yea read all that and still nothing at all
I didn't link digestion to my thought process (yet) BUT I do think that the Fitbit may have trouble with sleep stage on individuals with bradycardia. This is the first thoughts I've seen online linking these topics. If I figure out anything conclusive, I'll keep you posted.
@SunsetRunner I've stopped taking caffeine after 5pm; I take some warm milk or herbal tea.

I've noticed this week that packing my things and laying out my clothes for the next day has been giving me some peace of mind and I get to bed faster. A couple nights the 11pm mark was hit but I'm happy to say that it was not every day.

My sleep stages came back this morning after a full four weeks of having standard read-outs. Was just getting ready to hunt for a better device (and maybe still will). Did nothing different. Wore it the exact same way on my wrist; the battery was in the same state it has always been. The sleep stages for the Alta had displayed just fine for the first couple of months, then didn't show at all for a full month, and now for at least one night I got what I wanted. So, yes, it has proven to be a very unreliable device thus far.
If I fall asleep with the clock face of the Versa 2 completely flat on my mattress, under my pillow, does it mess up sleep readingsVersa 2? Every time I go to sleep at night on my left side, I don't get any readings. If I fall asleep on my right side, or, watch a movie lying down on my right side, I always get a reading unless I don't sleep the requisite number of hours. I wear my Versa on my left hand; I have a special medical ID that I must wear on my right wrist. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This happens to me if I am depressed. Except that for me, I tend to sleep more. This is not necessarily a good thing, but it does happen.
You don't. Once you manually log your sleep time, whatever activity happened during that time period will automatically get translated into sleeping/restless/awake per the fitbit formula.
@WavyDavey Interesting! I thought it was able to track something more than just movement haha. Thank you!

I had an appointment yesterday with my neurologist and told him that I recently began using my Charge HR to track my sleep and he just laughed and didnt make any other comments. I had a sleep study done last night with a take home device that I was provided, so I guess I'll see how those results stack up to my FitBit. In my personal opinion I think the sleep tracking on the Charge HR to be fairly accurate. There are a few quirks in the software and the way it reports things but overall I think it works well, and gives me a much better idea of my restless times and when I wake up so I can adjust to try things on my end and get more restful sleep. Cheers. -Kris
Thank you ! Also it updated my sleep score from 71 to 86 !Sent from Mail<> for Windows
@Nivasmarine I understand what you are saying. You can sort of do this on your own. If you want to sleep for 8 hours, for example, and you go to bed at 10, set your fitbit alarm for 6. It's not quite the same, but it works. You can go to feature request forum (https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/idb-p/features) and, if it gets enough votes, they may add it in. It would be like the reminders to move that the Alta has now.
I looked at it more like a security issue.  I have been a light twitchy sleeper for years and always got by on 2-4.  It all came to a head about 5 years ago and decided I had to address it.  We got a dog, I trained her to sleep on a dog bed that is between the front and back door.  If she's sleeping I'm sleeping.  I get 6-7 hrs a night regularly.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.Nik
I guess I'm lucky. I'm in my mid 60's and wake only once or twice a night and have 98% sleep efficiency. And I ususally have a cup or two of afternoon coffee.
Hi, I am buying a fitbit solely for its sleep tracking functionality. I was going to get the Alta HR as it seems to be the most compact one, but I was wondering whether Versa (being the new model) has a better hardware for sleep tracking which produces more accurate results?
I take ambien.
I find that 15 or 20 minutes of gentle hatha yoga before bed is great for helping me get a good night's sleep. If I want to do something more strenuous, like vinyasa yoga, that has to happen earlier in the day. If I do any kind of vigorous activity within a few hours of going to bed, I have trouble sleeping.

I'm looking at getting either a Charge 3 or a Versa 2, with my primary focus being on sleep tracking, though I'm not sure how interested I am in the alarm features. Do they track sleep automatically? Is the smart alarm feature the only real difference? Will I get the same data with either watch? I previously had a Zip, a One (fell somewhere between couch cushions and could never be found again), and a Garmin Vivosmart HR (fell off my wrist when the band broke, also never to be found again)....
Hi, @BrianaJo41.  There is some discussion about that if you go here (to this link) and scroll down to "Why don't I see sleep stages today?" https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htmThat is a thing that seems to just happen some times, kind of randomly.  Hopefully everything has resumed working properly by now.  If not, you might be more likely to get an answer if you search past posts and then post your question in the specific forum for your particular device.  I think some devices are more glitchy about sleep-tracking than others.  Good luck!

I have just recently purchased a Versa 2. When I wake up, I noticed that only 1 day had properly recorded my sleep. I have logged out and in again but it is the same. I have screenshot it but can't see how to attach it on here.
Hi, i am having trouble sleeping and getting enough sleep. I cant go to sleep early and i dont know how. Is there any suggestions that i can eat or drink to go to bed early or help me sleep better in the night? I got to bed at 9 and get up at 5
Are you enjoying your Garmin? I switched to Ticwatch because I grew tired of Fitbit trackers only lasting just beyond the 2 year warranty LOL
Does anyone have issues with balance?  I am feeling off
My Versa 2 isn't showing any sleep results, but if I go online, I can see some. However, when working, the results on the Fitbit are more detailed than online. How can I reactivate that function?
Great advices!
I have the same thing. I often wake up tired and I have lucid dreams every night. My resting heart beat is 60 ish, I am overweight though. I guess it might be that. I am suffering from anxiety at the moment and I have tinnitus (got Covid and it robbed me of the left hearing) my sleeping heart beat is at 70 and 90 for most of the night until about 5am, then I wake up at 6.30am.
How tight is your tracker to your wrist? I have found if it's too lose something I don't get a reading.

I switched the sleep mode from normal to sensitive. That was when I got results thst made sense. My actual sleep times varied from 2 to 4 hours over a 6 to 8 hour period. The times I've been restless topped at 13 once but in the past couple of days have gotten up to 21. I think part of it might have to deal with stress from work on the past couple of weeks but even on my days off it shows almost no difference. I did find a doctor that I've heard good things about so hopefully she will help me solve my restlessness. The main reason why I got the fitbit was for the sleep tracking. I just wish I could see my results all in one page instead of having to see them one at a time
If you know the bathroom trip is counted as restless sleep, what is the problem. I find this feature to be just great
I CAN'T GET MY FLEX INTO SLEEP MODE.  I TAPATAPATAPATAPATAP BUT I NEVER GET THE DUAL FLASHING LIGHTS THAT CONTINUE
My fitbit keeps registering steps while asleep, but I don't sleep walk, and nothing show up in the dashboard.  I have muscular spasticity. Could the spasms be registering as steps taken?
What do you mean by "set the timer and turned off the timer"? Was it in "sleep mode"? Were there 2 lights flashing when you tapped it?
I've recently started changing mine every few days and I noticed that my chart shows much more restlessness when I wear it on my non-dominant hand/wrist. Now I wonder which graph is more accurate. Maybe I move one arm a lot while I'm "sleeping"?

Woah! I thought I was bad as I usually have about 4 or 5, but that's a lot. Do you think perhaps you need to check in with a doctor?
This idea came to my mind. When do you think FitBit will bring this feature ?
I wouldn't use the fitbit sleep tracker as a diagnostic tool or in place of a medical examination, I think it is more fun/interesting than anything else. I am just interested to learn more about what others think of sleep tracking what their results are with sleep tracking and if others are experiencing difficulties with sleep. Actually I thought not getting enough deep sleep made sense, since I can't really say I have insomnia, I do sleep I just don't feel refreshed. I am interested to see if anyone has the sleep difficulties I have described in the post, baring in mind that the data I am using comes from actual EEGs and EKGs. I am happy though that the fitbit seems to be working at night as I know some people had trouble because of various sleep issues like sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.
I have the same concern but no answers. 😴
Oh yes, pain can have a big impact. I think it will be very challenging to get fully rested while dealing with pain. It is a constant energy drain on the body at many levels.

I'm not questioning how I am restless, I'm commenting on how the majority of the restless periods show up as being 11 minutes.
I try to practise good sleep hygeine. I go to be at the same time every night and wake up at the same time each morning. I have some sinus problems, so I sometimes take a tylenol sinus night time. It knocks me out. For the most part, I find if I don't use a breathrite strip, I awake during the night.
Hello,My sense 2 hasn't been displaying tracked sleep and stress-management scores for quite a while. It worked perfectly fine the first few months I had it, but it's just not doing it anymore. It is still tracking it however, because I can see the scores on the app. Restarting the watch usually fixes it for a day, but it stops working again the following night.
The sleep tracking seems mildly useless because it appears that it's lumping in my awake time as part of my sleep time.  Doesn't really give me an accurate picture.  I got up at 4 but it kept monitoring my awake time as part of my sleep time but, sleep time that I was awake as if I were rolling over for 38 minutes.
Thank you for saying this. Seconded.
It's based on movement, so if you're completely immobile while trying to fall asleep, it may think you are actually snoozing.

Hi Matthew,I have a lot of problem of slept because from last two month I don't sleep well. So I go to the doctor and he tell me that it is the lack of vitamin. As doctor suggestions I eat all kind of food and fruit but I don't feel better. So kindly tell me something so that I can slept deeply.
This could be an inaccurate reading or something else. My fitbit alta did this when i first started doing it but I tried incorporating some supplements such as 3-5mg extended release melatonin on certain nights in addition to L-tryptophan and the readings went to normal. My guess is that I never really had REM sleep before that on a regular basis.
D'oh! That's another thing about getting older - I have a memory like a seive! I was going to look into melatonin when I was in town today and totally forgot all about it.

I also have a hard time sleeping. I too suffer from insomnia and I am ADHD, my family say that I am not just ADHD but more like ADHD HD  (HD for High Definition) On average I sleep about 4 hours per night when I am not fighting the insomnia that is. I feel rested after 4 hours sleep, however when I a running on 1-2 hours sleep I know I am going to have a very rough day. I do resort to taking night time cold medecine when I feel sleep deprived, it does allow me to get 4 and sometimes even 6 hours sleep. I am also one of those power nappers, I can sleep for 15 minutes and feel completely refreshed as if I have had a good night sleep. More than 30 minutes and I will feel tired, and suggish all for the rest of the day. In my opinion sleeping sucks but we need it just as much as we need air. Wishing you luck in finding a sleeping routine that will work for you.
Where are instructions for monitoring sleep?

Last night, I went to bed as usual, only I used the manual settings to tell fitbit I was going to sleep (this is the first time I used it and I am not sure if it affected what happened next).  My alarm is set for 7:30am every week day.  Today, on a Tuesday, my alarm went off at 7:39am.  I have no idea why.  It still says it is set for 7:30am each day.  Is there a snooze feature I don't know about?  Any ideas why this happened? Thanks.

Melatonin isn't a sedating sleep aid.It's a sleep timing medication & works by telling your brain the time to go to sleep and the dose is only 0.2mcgs to 1mg any higher dose is wasted by your body hence persons feeling dozy cranky in there waking hours.If you take melatonin at the wrong time it will mess up your sleep pattern. Beware of this so call sleep medication because it isn't to be used as a sedative. Magnesium is better for sleep as not only does it help you calm the mind it also helps your heart & the rest of your body functions.Most of us now lack magnesium.
I've moved this thread from the hardware troubleshooting board to the lifestyle discussion on better sleep.
It could be that you might want to see if varying the time you go to bed helps.  If I go to bed at 9PM or even 10PM, I tend to get up for a couple of hours (1A or 2 AM until 3 or 4AM) then I go back to bed and sleep well. What do I do at that time?  I read, or I sit on the porch and listen to the crickets, think, journal or work on work stuff... sometimes I might even rearrange furniture, if I'm restless.. but that irritates the sleepers 🙂 ... I try not to go on the computer, but sometimes I do. On the other hand if I go to bed at 11P or so, I can usually sleep until 6AM without much restlessness. I usually get one night with 8 hours of sleep in any one week. The other nights are usually about 6-6.5 hours. I avoid all caffeine after 12noon, and I try not to do any exercise that increases my heart rate after 8PM as it will shorten my sleep to about 3 or 4 hours - then I AM tired! So, if you ARE tired, log things you eat that could be triggers, log exercise times, even tv shows and computer times can disrupt sleep patterns.  Did you know that before electricity was invented, it was normal to have a "second sleep" with time between the two sleep cycles? http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/opinion/sunday/rethinking-sleep.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0
Hi, @frauline_annie! That's definitely not the expected behavior. I'm guessing it's pretty new. For now, I would suggest editing the sleep log to the proper time and then giving it a few nights. Sometimes it takes a bit to settle into your rhythm.

Looks like mine. The info FitBit provide about sleep stages actually mentions that there are often wakeful times in the night that we are not even aware of.

As I haven't received my fitbit yet I can't test it, but I would think it doesn't. When you put it in sleep mode you basically tell it to measure your movements in a very different way and to register it for synchronization as sleep on your account.According to the help section though you can put your device in sleep mode for naps too; at the end of the day they supposedly are all added up together to show your total sleep. So maybe you could do that whenever you feel the need to nap come on? Edit to add: https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking
Hello @ham1218. Welcome to the community forums!
 
Thank you for being part of the Fitbit family and for sharing your experience. I'd like to let you know that Resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute when you’re still and well-rested. Typically, resting heart rate ranges from 60-100 bpm, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level.
 
Lifestyle changes can boost heart health and lower your pulse. Here are some good tips: 
 
1. Manage stress: anxiety and stress can elevate the heart rate, too. To help bring it down, try to bring calm to your day, For this, you can practice mindfulness, try to meditate or do breathing exercises.
 
2. Avoid caffeine and nicotine: caffeine and cigarettes can drive your heart rate up, cutting back (or cutting them out entirely) may help lower your resting heart rate.
 
3. Get moving: The most common cause of a high resting heart rate is a sedentary lifestyle, one where you spend a lot of time not moving. And being in poor shape can increase the risk of other problems, including obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. 
 
4. Stay hydrated: dehydration can cause the blood to thicken. That means your poor heart has to work even harder to push the blood around. To give your heart a break and lower resting heart rate, drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol (which can dehydrate you).
 
Note that Heart rate varies from person to person and day-to-day. But if you notice your heart rate is consistently over 100, especially if you’ve tried making lifestyle changes, it’s worth mentioning it to your doctor. 
 
Hope this helps.

Hi there,I also have the android ap and also have it on my laptop. The sleep sensitivity is in the settings on the laptop but I don't see it on settings on the android. See if you can adjust from desktop or laptop and then it should sync with the adroid app. I hope this helps.
I am 33 and have been pretty active at least 30 min of exercise daily. My average steps are 14k.
Sometimes I buy modafinil for my mother as she has obstructive sleep apnea and suffers sleep paralysis as well. Our doctor prescribed her 100 mg each morning, within the period of fifteen days. Unfortunately, my mother still suffers from the "leaving" of our father, who passed away this January. Bear in mind that large doses of this medical drug may have side effects such as insomnia, agitation, nervousness, anxiety, and many more. So be attentive, please. Or just consult with your doctor.

Hey Jason, I don't have the answer to your question, but if you feel like you have an unusual amount of awakenings (30+ seconds), please get tested for Sleep Apnea and/or other sleep disorders. These things are more common than you think. Evan

I'm very glad to hear that the Fitbit Relax Feature on the App is helpful for you! 😊 In my case I suffer from arm pain when weather is too cold and sometimes I just try to ignore that. I'll put into practice what you mentioned and I'll see how it goes.

Well if you move a lot in the middle of the night and are restless thenthat is why you are so tired and fall asleep within five minutes of lyingdown. Makes sense. Have you ever heard of restless leg syndrome? Also, youcan get steps while you are asleep.--Sabrina M.Riddell, ASMBC, BSBA, MBA

Hi @Mike2401 , I don't know of any fitness trackers that do that, and I'm not sure it's easy or difficult to implement. Most trackers I've seen, including Fitbit, calculate the sleep stages at the end of the sleep period. It seems they're not tracking stages real-time. I discovered this by editing the start/stop sleep times, and noticing that it affected the graphs for sleep stages. I used an Android app that did this very well, but got tired of having the phone in bed. Edit: It must be possible, as Fitbit is considering this feature.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
For four nights I had amazingly well rested long sleep (A full 7 to 8 hours.) However, last night I was not tired at all and didn't get tired until it was time to take my pills at 8 am. The only thing I could think of as to why this happened was because I had those four amazing nights that my body was so well rested that I wasn't able to go to sleep. Is that even possible? Also, I made sure that I didn't give in to my sleepiness at 8 am. I want to be able to keep having good sleeps and don't want to mess that up.
Hello @E_Ray and a warm welcome.  There was a flurry of activity in the forums about sleep scores changing, sleep times being recalculated, etc.  It seems there was a bug and it seems to have been fixed.

Laurie | Maryland, USAVersa 3, Luxe, Aria 2 | iOS | Mac OS Take a look at the Fitbit help site for further assistance and information.
There's some useful information on sleep tracking here: http://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking
I started using an Alta HR and now have just over a months worth of figures. According to the data I'm waking just over 30 times each sleep period - it ranges from 20 to 49 times on any particular night. Somewhere I thought I saw that the average Fitbit user wakes 8-10 times a night, but another article said that even up to 30 could be normal. Anyone know? I'm trying to work out whether my sleep is problematic or within the bounds of normality.
I had a decent weekend of sleep, though Friday night could've been better.   This morning's sleep score was 87 and I slept well, despite my dog hogging all my blankets last night.

although meditation does’t always help me. in most cases of insomnia after watching, I fall asleep much faster Thanks a lot FitBit☺️
I think you are on to something, @Maltz . Many sound machines offer rain, lapping waves, wind in the trees and other soothing sounds. For me, the best sleep comes when I can hear a constant, gentle rain outside my bedroom windows.
Then let’s change it!!!  Or have 2 numbers one for total hours of bed time the other for Fitbit fancy, everyone is sleep deprive, erroneous number!!!
That's not all that terrible, compared to some of my numbers that's a win. I'd get checked for sleep apnea and/or deviated septum. Both can cause some pretty severe sleep patterns. I had sleep apnea and a deviated septum, since getting my septum fixed I've noticed uge improvements in my sleep.

Hi, I noticed yesterday I was super tired as my fitbit said I only slept 5 hours. So I went to bed earlier the next night and lo and behold I slept 10 hours, made up the deficit and feel great today! Thanks Fitbit!
I use a CPAP device that pushes air into your nasal or oral cavity at pressure.  Sleep apnea is caused when your autonomic nervous system stops normal breathing and you awaken due to O2 deprivation. Or it could be caused by your tongue sliding back and partially closing your throat cavity.
mine only shows sleep about once every month or so and then its only aan hour.
You would know if it was Restless Leg Syndrome, for sure. It is neurological condition and it is a bear!I'm sure you are just rolling around! lol.But, seriously, if you get less than 4 hours a night and are interuppted 20-30 times, AND you are up all night masaging your calves and walking the halls just to get relief, then you have it. Sweet dreams!
Someone suggested adding a power nap function to Charge 3, which I think is a great idea.  Since Fitbit is tracking sleep anyway, it should allow users to turn on tracking a nap when they are ready to take a nap and wake up within 30 minutes of actual initiation of the nap (before hitting the deep cycle and getting groggy upon waking or affecting later sleep).  And one thing I never understand is why it takes 1-2 hours of sleep for Fitbit to log the sleep, while shorter sleep should be traceable with the position, heart beat, light exposure, etc.
Thanks for your efforts.  Loaded the fitbit app in my android phone and it works like a charm including benchmarks.  Don't know why the dashboard on my macbook air works differently but it does.  Problem solved, at least for me. HIM46
Two things that help me - backing off the carbs after lunch and supplementing with magnesium. When you have a carb-heavy meal at night, then eventually your blood sugar drops.  And you have to pee.  Both of those will make you wake up in the middle of the night, and you'll generally wake up hungrier anyway. I found the magnesium part by accident.  I get migraines, and somewhere I read that supplementing with magnesium helped.  I started taking it before I went to bed, and it really did reduce the frequency of my migraines.  I also noticed that I slept well.  On nights I forgot to take it, I didn't sleep as well.  Turns out it relaxes you - not enough to make you drowsy, but enough so that you roll over and think "I'm wide awake - there's no way I'll ever falll asl..." and then you're out like a light.

I know that from my personal experience as I'm apparently very good at keeping still when I first lie down but am not yet asleep. I can be awake for 20-30 minutes after I go to bed (I know because I'll look at the clock) and Fitbit will report that I fell asleep immediately. FYI.
Thank you for your answer. Have you ever changed your sleep schedule because of what your fitbit indicated ? For instance going to bed early or staying up a little late because of the sleep time recorded ?
I just bought a wedge for my back and this has caused my fitbit to not track my sleep....When I lie it tracks very well...
I need to add peppermint tea to my collection of teas.  Great idea!
I'm glad to hear that, too, but I wonder they they couldn't have left the graph as it was until the change was available.  I hope it's available soon because I'm not happy with it the way it is now.
Hello all, Ive been using the charge 3 to track sleep habits. Up until today it was showing the sleep stages graph. Then today I slept for 8ish hours and when I looked it reverted back to the old sleep graph with just the bars. I checked my heart rate data and I had a good heart rate reading through my sleep. I also re downloaded the app and did a soft reset of my Fitbit. Any reason why the graph reverted to the old graph? And how can I fix this.
My resting heart rate has been high recently as well. I've noticed since going back to the gym it's gradually decreasing, but I have the same questions.

@bvfitz I am sorry to hear it is not working for you. Restarting your tracker a few times (always give it 3 tries) can fix a lot of issues. This article explains how to restart your device.

Hello @SunsetRunner and welcome to the Help forums.  For the Charge 4, HRV is available in the Health Metrics tile.  HRV is not a graph.  It is a number.  According to the Help article, it doesn't require Premium.  The sleeping heart rate graph does require a Premium subscription.  You also need Premium to see a month's worth of data.  Older data drops off the chart.  If you aren't aware, Fitbit is in the process of rolling out a firmware update for the Charge 4.  It will also report your average sleeping SpO2. I agree, it is extremely disappointing that Fitbit has chosen to put valuable information behind a paywall.  Fitbit should make the advanced sleep data free to all users.

I had the same thing happen last night! I am dismayed and worried that something has been changed permanently. I have come to rely on the stages graphing to inform my neurologist of my sleep patterns. Her's hoping it was just a temporary glitch.
There are chunks of hours missing from my sleep log sometimes each night, so it looks like I only slept 2 hours instead of 8. I have switched from normal to sensitive and back, made sure my fitbit was fully charged each night, tried switching wrists. It seems accurate the times I do wake up to go to the ladies room, and the time I wake up, but the time I went to bed/sleep vs it says when I actually was asleep, can also be hours off.  I think the sleep is monitored by heart rate correct? If its at a low hr its considered sleep? Its not like I am sleep walking, or it would say I am awake right? Or would track additional steps? I believe the "restlessness" times, (too many animals in my bed and can tell by how trashed my bed is in the morning) but I dont understand the missing chunks of time.  Am I transporting myself into another dimension?  lol  Or does my fit bit have a glitch/issue? HELP!!!!!  😉
Hi All, Been a fitbit user for many years. The main reason being I needed to monitor my sleep and attempt to understand what causes me a bad night. After much research and reading the results of many tests and te reports, the general opinion is the average person gets to REM sleep in about 90 minutes. I am sure you have all discovered that REM sleep is critical, without it we don't recover. You only need to be in REM for seconds to get this benefit, but the damage of not getting there is cumulative.  I rarely get there and sometimes it can be several weeks before it happens. The results are exhaustion. What I would like from fitbit is the ability to automatically monitor for REM. That is, the graph will show if we get to and beyond 90 minutes. Not sure if this is possible or if fitbit staff monitor this forum, but I think for people like me who suffer, this would be very useful. Best regards Chris
What are some goals or METRICS I can track each night to see if good or bad sleep. 
 
I have right now: 
70+ sleep score
time asleep: 8 hours
 
I have fitbit premium. Any other metrics I should be tracking? Thank you

Inside the Fitbit app, it has averages for all the sleep stages, for your gender and age range. It doesn't give a total sleep time. I often hear between 7-9 hours, but I don't think they are taking the awake time out of the equation. I judge it by two things. One, is my resting heart rate will begin to climb if I'm not getting enough sleep. Others things can have an effect also, so it's not an exact science. Two, is by my performance weightlifting in the gym.  I need at least 8 hours net sleep to keep the ball rolling. Last night I got 8.5 hours net sleep and feel ready to tackle the workout!

Hi, I've been using IFTTT to save my sleep logs to a spreadsheet and now have 18 months of data accumulated. I'm trying to create meaningful graphs from the data but am a bit stuck. Has anyone done anything like this and, if so, can you give me a push in the right direction please? TIA
Well this morning, I can't see my sleep score.  I have a versa 2.  Does anyone else experienced same issue????Please help. It is totally frustrating!Sent from my T-Mobile 4G LTE Device

I also fall asleep in 0 minutes and have a 96% sleep efficiency.  I do believe it is accurate.  I do not sleep very long but the sleep I get is a deep sleep. I would like to learn to sleep longer each night.  Only getting 6.5 hours max per night.  Are you sleeping 8 hours with 97% efficiency?
My wife and I purchased the Fitbit charge 4 yesterday and our sleep charts are different. She has straight lines and I have zig zags. Why is this? She likes the zig zags vs the lines.
You were right! It was set to sensitive! SO much of a difference in readings last night. I did try a supplement to help me sleep also (High Burn 😎
I have always had very little interest in exercising. I am a lady in my 50s and have been at least 2 stones overweight for the last 2 years . My husband uses a Fitbit and asked me if I’d like one too .To be honest I wasn’t the least bit interested but he bought me one anyway. I have to say I was amazed at the information it told me about myself .when I saw how many calories I burn in a day it immediately made me more aware of what I was eating and in only 12 days I have lost 10 lbs it has also made me more active walking to places before I would have nipped in the car . I’ve not excersised yet but amazingly I am thinking about it !
Hi.I recently bought the new Charge 4 which has the feature. In my opinion this is the best wearable Fitbit have produced yet.Search around for just over £100 .You won't be disappointed.
Nothing has changed...   but this morning I noticed I was missing last night's sleep info.   I have all of the info from the day before and since I got the Fitbit one week ago.    I assume I am doing something wrong!   Any thoughts on why this had just stopped updating.   BTW, over the past week....the sleep updates happened shortly after waking up.....I assume immediately after waking.   I usually check within an hour after waking or less and the data has already updated. Battery is nearly fully charged!Now new sleep positions - back and sideI go to sleep and awake about the same time all week, give or take an hour here and there.I have cleared the cache in my browser - even tried a different browser - Chrome and SafariI have synced from my iPhone. Any thoughts as to why this has just started happening?
According to Fitbit the little red ticks are very small body movements. My AHI has been zero since I started using VPAP for central apnea on 6/2/19. I am a care take for my wife who has Alzheimers for five years which plays a part in my tired feeling. I'm monitoring with Fitbit Charge 3 the percentage of REM and deep sleep I get. Last night I had 15.2% REM and 11.3% deep and feeling very tired. I ave used RESMED S9 for four nights at 6 hours/night and seeing if I can bring percentages up, and I can feel better. Good luck with yours.

I would have to agree with @shipo on this one! Every time I read before bed, the book was like "OK, you're done with the drama. Haha, kidding! Here's a good plot twist." I had to keep reading! 
 
What I do is that I drink chamomile tea before going to sleep, and I listen to calming music. It works amazingly, and I wake up with a lot of energy the next day!

I am  using flexfit...Thanks for the tip.  I will return back to the sleep tile later in the day then just to see if it populated like yours did.
I have auto-update turned off and updated the FitBit app this morning - now I wish I hadn't - the new version is effectively a "downgrade" for my premium account so if they don't fix it ASAP then I'll quit the premium account - the "enhanced" display effectively makes it much harder to check the data.  It was always so easy but now I have to fiddle with the app.  A nice account addition would be to give users the ability to remove the most recent "update" when it's a pain in the butt.
It would be nice to be able to select a different period of time. ie weekly and weekly average shown.  Just a suggestion.
My fitbit has stopped keeping track of my sleep patterns.  I have tried re-syncing, etc.   Any help is appreciated.  Thanks
@cuallaidhGreat to see you around the forums! 
 
Happy to hear that the surgery seems to have gone well and your sleep efficiency is almost to 100%. Keep us posted! 

Erick | Community ModeratorIt's all about the food! What's Cooking?
I just got my fit bit less than a week ago, but tracking my sleep I have noticed a pattern.  I seem to wake up at least once an hour, some I am probably restless, but most I am actually at least lightly waking up.  Is this normal?  It seems like a lot and it is so consistant.
I agree, the new sleep log is basically worthless.
I've got an Inspire HR and recently found out you can change your sleep tracking from "normal" to "sensitive" and did so two days ago.   Once I made this change, I noticed that the app shows two different values for my awake time and light sleeping time depending on whether it's the the main home summary screen you're looking at or whether it's the actual sleep screen. Home screen : 1hr 1min awake / 4hr 35 min light sleepSleep screen : 40 min awake / 4hr 52 min light sleep Why the contradiction?  This only started happening over the past two days since I switched to "sensitive".
If you do your blood test every six months, just ask your doc.
Hmmm, when Sleep-Stages first came out it was spotty at best for me, however, it's been pretty consistent for me for a long time now.  Your post made me take a second look, I just scrolled through my sleep logs for the last 18 months, and not a single night popped up with out Sleep-Stages.  I wonder if your Charge 2 is having an issue.
Hi Wilson, thanks for the reply. The reason I am bring up this issue is that I have been using fitbit for many years and never had any issue like this until this year, and it happens quite often (about twice a week) and has a pattern (i.e. always Tuesdays and Thursdays). That is why I believe something has changed. Also, I just switched to my wife's device (I bought a new Versa for her) and it still happens, so I don't think it is a problem of device.One difference that I have noticed is that my fitbit now start doing backend synchronization. i.e., I am at 5000 steps at 6PM and then I go downstairs to play basketball. I don't bring my cell phone with me but when I come back to my room and open my cellphone I can see that it already picked up the new steps. What if it does a background sync at 4AM and then failed to sync the rest of my sleeping later? Just some random thoughts.

Thank you so much for your suggestions. I have printed them out and will incorporate them into my sleep time practices. I am convinced every conscious effort will help and I very much appreciate your taking the time to write to me!Sara
It subtracts all your restless and awake minutes from your total sleep.
@PamelaHazelton wrote:It's based on movement, so if you're completely immobile while trying to fall asleep, it may think you are actually snoozing.I agree with this. Sometimes when I watch TV on the couch just before bed, Fitbit thinks I'm already in bed/asleep because I don't move around much.
When users say your sleep scores are gone, it's often impossible to tell if you mean the sleep tile if missing from the phone app, or that the sleep tile is there and you are getting a sleep record but just not the sleep stages and a sleep score. If the sleep tile is missing from app, try the Edit button near top right of Today screen, then scroll down to 'Additional Stats" to see if it is there to be added back.If you are getting sleep record but not sleep stages or sleep score, it might mean  it is not getting a consistent heart rate reading through the night.  Or perhaps it could mean your heart rate is irregular.Note well: Neither of these has anything to do with paying for Premium.  I understand if you choose to go with some option other than Fitbit, but blaming Premium for this would not be a good reason.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Has it been working and giving you a sleep score consistently everyday? For those of us manually logging our sleep it’s showing scores when it feels like it; one day a week or not at all. Fitbit admins say the same thing each time they’re asked about it; and post a link to crap that has nothing to do with the issue.
I wake up in the middle of the night because of i need to go to the bathroom, it happen almost every night, i am not so old, i am just in the early 30s. I can go back to sleep as long as I do not make some mistake to check the phone, if i check the phone, then automatically my eyes cannot shut because maybe my brain already attracted to read the notification, the feeling to feel sleepy is gone. Then what i do, (i need to sleep because of need to go to work in the early morning), i will try to some light exercise, something like require some energy to do that, i don't know maybe a few sit up, or get up to clean the room or whatsoever, then the feeling of tired kicks in, then i fall asleep again.
I'm not sure there is a "normal" - everyone is different. This article may help you understand the data&colon; https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking
FITBIT, why are you not fixing those stupid flaws in your trackers ?? People like myself do not get the slppe we need becource the stupid watch keep turning on all throug the night.I have turned all features off, "HR", "Auto on display" and so on, but still, a little tap or two in "the right" order will make the crap light up the room!! And i wake up! I didnt know why, but I found my self on the edge of breaking totally down in stress and was tired all the time, and then for some reason I slept some nights without the stupid tracker, and in just a few days, i was much better!!! So now i NEVER sleep with the watch on me anymore, and i feel so much better!! The crappy watch will make people sick, and wil proberbly even get someone killed, as people will fall a sleep all over, even when driving.  Fix the stupid fault NOW! I can live with the watch turning off the display on a timer, and on again on a timer, in the morning, or perhaps turn the clock and the HR off when it discover that you are at sleep.The display should ONLY turn on at night when i press a button for more than 1 sec.!! Fix the crap now!
Yes, I understand it says that - but doesn't really go deeper into it, nor comment if the number goes up to 40+??
@t_jd I don't. It must know that I'm not wearing the fitbit and so doesn't create a sleep record.
Thank you again.  🙂It is interresting that we have almost identical numbers, yet you are rested, and I am not 🙂 It may be pain that makes me feel unrested (spondylitis), and I wake up earlier than I need to because of this pain/stiffness because I have to get up and move to release the pain.
@10thousandsteps Thank you for your reply. 
 
If you continue seeing inaccurate sleep or any other discrepancy, my best recommendation is that you please reach out to our Support Team. This way they can further review your situation and further assist. You can contact them through chat or over the phone and you can click here to get connected. 
 
You can also comment the syncing report to our Support Team, but I'd like to let you know that Data should only automatically syncs to the Fitbit app each time you open the Fitbit app, so your device syncs automatically when it's nearby. If by any chance you're using MobileTrack, I recommend disabling this to avoid any inconvenience with your steps tracked by your Fitbit device and MobileTrack. 
 
I also recommend visiting the following link, to see how Fitbit devices sync their data: How do Fitbit devices sync their data?. 
 
See you around.

Hi ConnieDee, the only way to rule out a sleep disorder truly is to have a sleep study done.
Thanks so much for your suggestion re picking one time or behavior andsticking to it. I have trouble with consistency, but this sounds like goodadvice and I will do it! Dotty
Mine stopped too just yesterday. What happened. Was the main reason I use the tracker. Any ideas on how to get it back much appreciated.
Great suggestion! My Doctor recommended turning off all eletronics an hour before having to turn in also - so put the LED smart phones down in bed. ha ha! It actually helps me to fall asleep faster too. Just an idea to help others.
I have a Blaze. My Iphone has the ios app, my Samsung tablet has the Android app.  Both have totally different sleep tracking results,  sometimes 2 hours difference for the same nights sleep. At least one, if not both,  is very inaccurate

Hello guys, when I wake up the first thing that I do is take a shower, so I take off my Charge, then when I look at my dashboard I saw that the fitbit thought that I woke up after my shower. How can I tell to charge that I woke up earlier? (sorry about my English)

How to get the Charge 2 to include sleep after getting up a few minutes to go to the bathroom. It usually thinks the night is over, even if I leave the Fitbit in my bed (sometimes works) unless it is after 6 hours of sleep and it assumes my night is over.
Hi @Krusop I just came across your post and realize it's been a long time, but wanted to see if the issue persisted or got correct.

I have worn mine both ways and currently clip it to my shorts also because the velcro has worn out on the wristband. I've noticed that it doesn't track "restless" or "awake" periods as well because the movements are much smaller compared to when it's on your wrist. Other than that, the sleep times are accurate but I wouldn't take the other measurements too seriously when worn this way. Hope this helps!

@alexthecat, Interesting! 😮
 
Thanks for sharing your experience! I was investigating and it seems that Hatha and Vinyasa yoga incorporate many of the same poses. But the main difference is the pacing of the classes. Vinyasa moves at a faster pace and requires greater breathing control than Hatha yoga. Because it's done more slowly and poses are held for longer, Hatha yoga allows for more stretching.
 
I honestly have just tried the Hatha style, 😅 but I'll give it a try to the Vinyasa one to see if my experience is similar‌. 
 
Have a great day!

Awake only means there was a certain amount of movement detected. I prefer the old term restless, but the new one is awake. It's not uncommon to have dozens of small periods of awakeness per night without being conscious of it.

I am having the same problem on my Charge 2
Thank you!
Hello @Walkertalke  What do you mean ? Generally the skin temperature function gives you a deviation from a baseline computed over 3 nights when you start wearing the device. There are no interpretation of whether it is better to have a negative deviation than a positive.
Hi!  I have a couple easy questions for you:1. What is the green star to the right of my sleep log?2. My "Estimated Oxygen Variation" zig-zag line runs roughly ½ way between the two horizontal bars.  Is that low?  The green line never touches either the high or low horizontal bars.Thanks!Michael P.S. How do I insert an image of my Estimated Oxygen Variation?  The icon wants to know about the image but doesn't have the expected location finders to choose the image.

Sometimes my Charge HR take 20-30 minutes after I get up before it shows up. I'd wait a little bit first before you do anything ..You can manually log it in form the dashboard on your PC.
I was sent for an in-home sleep study test last month. Lucky for me, my Fitbit Blaze arrived the same morning so I was able to compare it against the professional gadget with all the monitoring wires etc. I got my test results back today and am still trying to compare them to the Blaze readings. But the efficiency is pretty close with using the Sensitive mode on my Blaze. Blaze gave me a 67% sleep efficiency and the professional sleep study came back as 72%. Blaze did say I woke 6 times, compared to 4 times of the professional one.  I personally think the Fitbit Blaze (can't speak for the others as the Blaze is my first tracker) is pretty accurate at monitoring your sleep.....even if out just slightly. The 'normal' mode in my opinion is way off - at least was for me. It gives me near 100% efficiency and after learning my sleep issue today, I KNOW that is very incorrect! If anyone else is achieving poor sleep efficiency - well below 90% on a regular basis, I highly recommend getting a sleep study done!
Right, this is what I found https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1041329-how-do-i-restart-my-tracker- This is supposed to be a fix for problems including no tracking of movement. Of course this is based on the assumption that it has worked properly before. If not, you might want to read this https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking and check sensitivity settings
does it shows all your day sleep time?

I'll add that it's on the normal setting
@Elizabetta I just had my sleep study and MSLT a few days ago! (Had to reschedule due to work). I have preliminary results of "pathological daytime sleepiness" but they won't give me the full results until I see the neurologist which isn't for a while, October 30th 😞. Hoping they call me with more information sooner. I am fascinated that you're a PA too and were able to get through school because I always doubted my symptoms thinking I'd never get through school if I was really that sleepy! I was actually originally given thyroid medicine for a NORMAL T4 and a TSH of like 5.9 when I was in school and complaining of sleepiness, hallucinations and specifically falling asleep during rotations, even while scrubbed in during surgery! Thankfully I recognized this and stopped taking the levothyroxine.  I'd love to hear more about your experiences and how you deal with work. I find myself becoming drowsy while talking to patients... it's so bad! Anyway I bet they would let me compare my sleep graphs so I will keep you posted!
FYI that link to "more about sleep tracking" just takes you to the general Fitbit Help site - impossible to find anyting about sleep tracking there.
@Drduggie Thank you so much for the information! 
 
@Bartfliet Thanks for your input! I agree with you. I was curious about which mask works for him and consider that one for purchase if my doctor agrees, but so far I've heard that the ResMed AirFit F20 is one of the most widely used CPAP masks for sleep apnea.
 
On a side note, it's great to hear that you have already consulted with your doctor about your situation. I hope the recommendations help and thanks for sharing the tips. 
 
Have a wonderful day!

Hi you're correct it does subtract awake from total sleep time. There's not a setting for it. I just do it as a manual adjustment in the goal, to try and counterbalance however much awake time I usually get.

It is set to seven hours and has been. That's what support suggested to check as well.
My fitbit tells me my resting heart rate is 69 to 71 when I wake up.  I'll monitor my heart rate with the fitbit throughout the day and it ranges from 79 to 98 depending on what I'm doing, But even if I'm at my desk and typing away my heart rate will stay in the high 80's to low/mid 90's. Not sure if sitting, typing and talking on the phone is considered resting but it does bother me that I'm not in high 70's low 80's during this time. I'm 59 years old..
I noticed this morning that my HR while sleeping dropped down to 38. It isn't uncommon for it to go down to 46-50 while I am sleeping but this is the first time I have noticed it drop down that low. I will be making an appt to see my PCP (which of course I literally just saw him last week) but wondered if anyone else has noticed that low of a dip.  Some history- 32 year old female -I lost 100lbs over a years time and have maintained it for the past 6 months.  I normally work out 5 days a week, mostly weights and some light cardio.  HR while working out does not go above 160 and that is basically on heavy leg days. The past month I have not been as religious about my workouts, I recently have been struggling with anxiety which I take magnesium and ashwagandha for. (all cleared with my PCP)  I did not work out yesterday so I am thinking I was just really relaxed?  Anyone else?
Further to my earlier list here is an example for me. This is last night
I rarely do. I have to exhaust myself through physical exertion during the day to really sleep deeply all night.

Yes --- I wonder how many others have had this happen. It seems very odd
I just got a Charge HR last week and notice my heart rate goes down to about 60 when I sleep. But Fitbit says my RHR is about 75, why is that?  OK, I see they for some reason want to use daytime data.. but since I rarely sit still, they aren't really getting a resting heart rate!
oh I thought my sleep efficiency was bad (at 55% average).. I guess it's that it only track body movements but not brain activity so I could just consider myself as some kind of more "vigorous" sleeper and stop worrying about it 🙂Spoiler (Highlight to read)

Why is there no  easy  access "how to " manual instead of scrolling through  mountains of questions from other  annoyed fitbit users.  I have had this fitbit 2 days any already  frustrated and  annoyed with  all the  time wasting.  My current question  is  how to access anything either by fitbit or by my phone app for fitbit sleep info.  I do not know how to  find any data and I'm sure the next question will be how to  interpret it.  If the info is accessed  from the  app where is it?  if  its  on  the  fitbit  where is  it?  Most items come with  instruction manuals with basics on  how to  get you up and  running why is this little gadget any different!!!

Lack of sleep is the biggest problem because it is very detrimental to your health. It leads to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, adverse changes in the intestinal barrier, and the development of autoimmune diseases. Poor rest also often causes inflammation, which affects the microbiota, causing bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. Overweight problems, depression, frequent infectious diseases, and metabolic disorders are also caused by poor sleep. But the best remedy is faith in God. I am by no means advocating it. I know that it helps a lot. When I can't sleep, I always read Bible verses for recovery, and it helps me.
Interesting! Well, I'm kind of glad to know I'm not the only one. 🙂 So far I haven't had it happen again, probably because I haven't switched to my Zip close to wake up time, so it must know "hey she's really still awake". Fingers crossed it'll be all fixed up soon for us multi-FitBit folks!
I get about 6% REM at night and I’ve never had sleeping problems except sometimes getting up to pee. That’s about 20 minutes since I get an average of 8hrs 2mins a night. I figure it’s just wildly inaccurate since I don’t seem irritated when I wake up like it says I should. I get sleepy everyday about 3 pm but who doesn’t. Don’t fret the little toy on your wrist. If you’re actually worried a doctor is the person to discuss that with not a forum.
Melatonine can work wonders. You may have to experiment with it a few times though. For me, I have to take it about an hour before I want to fall asleep. By the time I am ready to go to bed, it has started to kick in 🙂
I found on normal my Charge HR overestimated my sleep, on sensitive it then recorded that my average nights' "sleep" was 2.5 - 3 hours in 15 - 20 sessions, no evidence of sleep cycles etc. This helped me convince my GP that my memory problems, basically a random inability to access previous memories, especially how to find places and people I'd been to many times in the past, might be due to sleep.Had the overnight session with electrodes everywhere at Papworth, the UK's sleep clinic, was found to be getting less than half the recommended amount of REM sleep which is when the brain does it's "memory filing".Thought to be due to the brain not getting enough oxygen - trial with a CPAP machine reduced number of low oxygen periods from 16 an hour to a normal 4 an hour.  Interestingly, not only did the Fitbit record my best ever "non moving" sleep (over 5 hours) but also that my heart rate stayed around 60 rather than as usual falling to the low 50's and sometimes even below 50.
I was disappointed by the new sleep display...gone are the sleep stages and now i only have a display of time asleep, awake, etc.  not very helpful!...how do i get the old display back?
Great - can you ensure it is csv format and not excelSent from my iPhone
Thanks I'll take a look

Almost like 2 months backs I had a trouble sleeping whole night. I dont know why but most probably ( i think so) it was due to heavy weight lifiting in evening and a black coffee.  Now after this incident I have a  phobia in my mind that I will not be able to sleep and this haunt me whole day. During night even I am feeling sleepy I have this in my mind that I will not sleep and hence a very disturbed sleep. Anyone please help. Should I meet any doctor?
I'm trying to record my nap from this afternoon, but went to sleep after midnight and it not letting me have 2 sleep record for one day.    Charge 5 If I try to do what you suggested, my heart rate won't be accurate. I slept 3.5 hours and then I had a 2 hr nap this afternoon. ( Prior to now)..
I was wondering the same thing.
@Jnadeau to me it looks like you changed your sleep setting from normal to sensitive.. You want it set for normal. Now if you go to your sleep log you can edit a sleep record between normal and sensitive to compare. With the sensitive setting it will record every single movement as if you are awake, even that bounce when the cat jumps on the bed.  See this post by @CallieM
Since weather changes can affect my arthritis, they also affect my sleep. I always thought my Grandma was exaggerating  when she said she could predict weather She wasn’t. It’s true!  I manage the changes by being aware and listening to my body. It was difficult for me. I used to just push past pain, no matter what. I’ve since learned that an afternoon nap and soothing music while meditating before bedtime can really help. The Fitbit Relax app is also helpful.
Great suggestions @JSuswaram @Maria527! Thank you for sharing these bedtime habits. 😁

You're correct.  It is the percent of time you were actually sleeping compared to how long you were in bed.  I would say 92% is good, I'm usually in the 30-40% range :(.
I'm not sure I understand your question.  Are you questioning the accuracy of Fitbit's calculation, or are you saying it should be comparing your sleep stages to set amount rather than % of your sleep? Also, check you are reading numbers correctly. If 65 minutes was 11% of your sleep, that means you got close to 10 hours of actual sleep, which could be right but is worth checking. Then you toss in 150 minutes.  I have no idea where that came from.  Are you saying that is some standard of the amount of deep sleep people should get?  If so, I would like to see your source.  And the amount in different stages certainly varies by age.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
@EdsonFitbit wrote:Wow @Colinm39. That is very interesting. Thanks for sharing this with us. @EdsonFitbit Thanks for the response. I have posted this information elsewhere but I forgot to mention in this post is that "when you create the Custom Activity for HR it treats it like a manual activity and flattens the calories and you could lose Active Minutes". I normally create the graph from the Mobile phone and it gives me the exact calories, from the PC there is always a calorie difference. For sleep we don't mind, but when you create extended hours, like Fitbitters maybe analysing their work HR etc or even the 24 HR you need to watch the calories and Active Minutes and/or delete the created record once you have examined it. Have a great evening..

Last night I had a terrible night's sleep - I know because I was clock watching most of the night! However my fitbit hasn't recorded this. Is there a way to manually edit my sleep report so that it is a more accurate representation of my sleep? Thanks in advance
Lack of sleep is linked to a number of unfavorable health consequences including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression. Some psychiatric conditions can cause sleep problems, and sleep disturbances can also exacerbate the symptoms of many mental conditions including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I'm not sure if it has to do with REM time but it's a really difficult topic. Good to know that you've improve your sleep and you're taking care of yourself. 
 
@RBclimber it would be great if you could update your situation now.

I've had the fitbit force for about 6 weeks and I usually get a sleep effeciency of 80- 90%. Is that a good number for healthy living?
Hi @SunsetRunner, thanks for sharing in detail. I would point out that the sleep stage tracking is fairly new here. For a serious medical condition, I'm not sure how much I'd rely on it for condition monitoring. It's not an exact science, at least not yet. Deep sleep deprivation seems more often reported here to than not enough REM. That's why I started a thread discussing it that's near the top. Hopefully you may benefit from it also.

@Flynn   Fitbit's sleep tracking has a very good reputation.  But sleep stages are an EEG diagnosis, something that a Fitbit can't provide.  You also wrote that you got the same result on different devices.  I agree with you that this doesn't seem to be a Fitbit issue.  This article from the Sleep Foundation might help you a little.  You also wrote that you already do many of the suggested ideas.  If you feel like your sleep quality is good and you wake up refreshed, you might not need to do anything.  If you are concerned, you should see your healthcare provider.I'm moving your post to the Sleep Well forum.  Your issue doesn't seem to be specific to the Sense 2.

Laurie | Maryland, USAVersa 3, Luxe, Aria 2 | iOS | Mac OS Take a look at the Fitbit help site for further assistance and information.
I've tried the regular and sensitive sleep mode. In the regular, I seem to sleep pretty well, with 8-12 minutes of restlessness. In the sensitive mode, my 'sleep' is dramatically reduced and I have more than2 hours of restlessness. How do you know which is right?
How does Fitbit calculate your sleep and awake mode? I'm baffled that it knows when I'm awake or just restless. Is it taking my palse rates?
Since the new sleep tracker update, (which I love by the way) there have been a few nights that my sleep is tracked using the old method. Why is that? And how can I make sure it only tracks using the update?

The problem of not automatically generating sleep start and end times only happened to me for the two days.  I had a further problem on Wed July 15 of getting detailed sleep data but no sleep score.  There appears to have been a software update last night either the IOS App or the ALTA HR firmware or both and the sleep score appeared retroactively.  I have a feeling that because I see a delay in calculating the sleep score on the IOS app, the score is possibly calculated on a server somewhere and sent back to the local app.  I get no indication as to when server software may be updated.  Based on my experience I might guess that the glitches that we are seeing could be due to a failure to rigorously test new software updates on all platforms before releasing them, but I am not a Fitbit employee and have no insight into their software development process so this is would be only a guess and I will not commit to it.
Hi,I like the way Fitbit now shows sleep analysis and it's results are starting to make a bit more sense to me. I'm often tired (body and mind), and can be irritable and have suffered from depression for years. I've noticed I have above average length of time for R.E.M. Sleep, which has been connected to depression and irratibility (see above) I don't feel like I have much deep sleep I think the above example was a good night for deep sleep tbh.  Does anyone have any recommendations for getting a bit more deep sleep and a little less R.E.M.? (As much as I love being able to recall many dreams each night sometimes I just need a proper rest)

I totally agree. I absolutely LOVE my Sleep Cycle app. I hope they will partner with them soon! I would love if they synced together to offer even more accurate results. P.S. Your phone doesn't have to be plugged in... it's just recommended. 🙂 Not sure if that changes anything, haha.
Thanks, I understand how sleep is recorded a bit better now.The film was well worth seeing, but I do not think that it is Oscar standard.
I have no idea what's wrong or what will fix it. I have tried all the suggestions as well and nothing worked then suddenly I got the stages back.A few days later I lost them again and last night I had them again. My wife has had a similar experience but currently doesn’t have them.
thanks you for sharing how well your does not work either....so sad to pay so much $$$$
FOLLOW UP: I am in awe how our bodies adapt and respond to changes.  Due only to persistence and my sleep research, I offer this progress update to those interested in the science of healthy sleep habits.  My restoration sleep score continues to improve (21 to 23 out of 25) which in turn affects the overall sleep score with daily averages now in the 90 to 95 range.  I am committed more than ever to adapt everything I have gleaned so far into a lifetime of healthy habits towards restful sleep. Thank you Fitbit for participating and being a vital part of my overall healthy lifestyle. Excellent answer Squatticus.I subscribed to Fitbit premium to use as a guide to help me set and achieve better health goals. My rationale, I would rather spend $6.67 per month for Fitbit premium in order to stave off hundreds of dollars per month in prescription drugs for the rest of my life. I find the sleep data and analysis plus the other guides that come with the Fitbit premium quite useful.Having said that, as far as the sleep score is concerned; for me, it is simply another tool to help me achieve improved health by developing healthier lifestyle choices. I don’t view the sleep score as competitive or some race I have to win.  For me personally, I ascertained my biggest hurdle was the restoration subset of the sleep score which is based on the sleeping heart rate.  Because of the data from my sleep score analysis, I discovered by lowering my resting heart rate and my sleeping heart rate naturally through interval training and breathing exercises, I improved my sleep restoration. For the first time last night, my sleeping heart rate was below my resting heart rate 65% of the time I was asleep, which gave me a score of 21 out of 25. A huge improvement since I started tracking my sleep in the Fitbit app. This small progress is definitely worth the $6.67 per month.Don’t get me wrong, the Fitbit premium is not a solution for everyone but it certainly has shed some light on areas of fitness and health I wasn’t even aware of. It is my wish we all can achieve our overall health goals through our sweet dreams...

	狂乱 Hey Kids!
I've had my Fitbit Alta HR since mid July 2017 and I have used my Fitbit on sleep sensitive setting. I've liked seeing the sleep pattern insights yet I'm baffled as to why the last two nights it has showed restless sleep. So, I was wondering if anyone could shed any light on why my Fitbit thinks I've had restless nights sleep & only managing just over 3 hours total sleep.Yet there have been other nights when I know I've been awake a lot, due to being hot for example yet this was not picked up as restless. Is this normal? Happened to anyone else? Or is it a bug with the Fitbit?

Often I go to sleep and am asleep for 3 or 4 hrs, then wake up and stay awake for 30-45 min, then back to sleep for another 3-4 hrs. Instead of grouping the night together I get 2 sleep scores, usually poor or fair, vs if I could see the 2 combined with combined REM etc, my sleep score would be better and truer to what actually happened. 
 
At this point there is no way to combine scores in one night without erasing all data from one sleep cycle.
 
Would love to see this feature expanded!

I am new (less than 1 week) to Fitbit. I have a Surge and was encouraged by my coworker to get a premium account.  With all that I can't figure out how to get a heart rate plot with an arbitrary start and stop time from the collected data.  I have looked in the main website client, and in the Android app, and although I have heart rate graphs for defined exercise sessions, I can't find a way to show them for sleep sessions, or for any arbitrary time period, e.g. sitting in meetings, etc.  Please point the way for me.  A thousand thanks.

Thanks for your reply, I do often have a look at my tablet just before bedso perhaps I will give that a rest and see how it goes. Thanks again.
I think studies show that an hour away from devices are best, but for me I can sleep regardless, because if I'm tired, nothing will stop me from sleeping. I usually can go effectively from a device right to bed.

I also take thyroid medication for my underactive thyroid. Typically my sleeping HR is under my RHR about 90+% of the time. However, if I eat carbs/sugar before bed, the number drops b/c it takes a few hours for my HR to settle under my RHR. Additionally, my resting HR is skewed high because I can't wear my Fitbit during the day at work, so I only wear it after work when I hit the gym, while sleeping and weekends. Fitbit calls my RHR at about 47 to 48 bpm, and I measure my RHR (during the day, at work) at about 39 to 42 bpm. I am fit, but not this fit. The thyroid medication helped with my weight, but I also started having exercise induced heart arrhythmia, so I find I have to warm up carefully first to no jolt my heart into going from zero to sixty too quickly. I am also tired quite a bit, and get slightly light-headed after long periods of sitting, if I stand too quickly. My bottom line, I think, is that the thyroid meds help with some aspects, but not everything. I am not a doctor, so my opinion is just that... I would talk to your doctor about this at your next visit.

I experienced this last night. My Flex has deleted a weeks worth of sleep data.  Already reset my unit, manually synced, logged on here and going to see what happens tonight. Will check back in tomorrow to see if there are any new posts for updates.  Thoughts?
Good for you. I got on CPAP in the 90's for the same reasons (plus I was going to sleep everytime I drove) Its well worth the aggrivation of getting used to using it. 🙂
Interesting topic everyone! 
 
I'm used to wake up very early as well, usually around 4:00 - 4:30 in the morning. 
 
I've also developed that natural alarm you were talking about, and I now wake up at the same time everyday without using the alarm on my phone. 
 
I changed my schedule at work for a little while to the night shift, but I still woke up the same time. 😁 😪

I can be so tired that it is all I can do to stay awake, but when I go to bed, I can not go to sleep.
Hi @catbrat101 - Please contact Support. They should be able to help.
Hello everyone, I found an interesting post from my friend @AndreaFitbit about how to sleep better. Her post is in our Spanish forums, so I wanted to talk about it on this board to hear what are your best practices to conceive a better sleep.
 

 
Tips that I found more interesting are: 
 
1. Adopt a sleep schedule. Get up every day at the same time, even during the weekend. This measure allows to keep the rhythm of the sleep. Also try to sleep at the same time each day.
 
2. To get more energy, try to perform some dynamic activity when getting up and it is important to have a nice and nutritive breakfast.
 
3. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and other chemicals that interfere with sleep. As a coffee lover, I know caffeine is a stimulant that can keep you awake. So avoid caffeine for four to six hours before bedtime. Similarly, smokers should refrain from using tobacco products too close to bedtime.
 
4. Avoid having electronic devices around like the TV or the mobile phone, as this could be potentially distractions to sleep and rest well.
 
5. Try to relax at the end of the day, at least 30 minutes before bedtime. Here you can take advantage of the new feature: Guided Breathing Sessions of the Charge 2.
 
In my case I have the bad habit to sleep while my TV is On. Usually I don't see any interesting show or movie that could distract me from my sleep, but sometimes is hard to catch a good rest whit the flashing light of the screen flickering all over the room.
 
So comment below what are your best practices to sleep better.

Roberto | Community Moderator"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.” What's Cooking?
Thanks for your answer. So from what you've described you're mainly using your fitbit for the fitness features, do you use the sleep features at all ?
Twenty times a night is excessive; do you have your FitBit set to "Sensitive" or "Normal" sleep detection?  Sensitive is designed for tracking sleep disorders and such, so you may want to switch if you have it on that currently.  If it's on normal and you're moving around enough for it to register twenty times... you may want to talk to a sleep specialist. Hope that helps!

I also have this problem sometimes, but it is usually because I sleep less than 8 hours per night
I would recommend an earlier sleep time. Going to bed an hour earlier has helped me. Have you tried a natural sleep like melatonin? I like it because its gentle unlike a sleeping pill.

I want the ability to completely disable the display at night. Despite having quick view turned off my device turns on every time I roll over while sleeping. The charge 2 is so bright it wakes up both me and my souse.
I have had quite a lot of spikes on the variations graph. I know my doctor though, and although I am worried, I also know that she will not take this seriously. I'm not quite sure of what do do, as it is a worry.My health isn't great as it is and I am overweight, so I could easily have sleep apnoea.Yvonne
@Hopeless10 Welcome to the Fitbit forums! Thanks for posting this request about sleep stages in Fitbit Surge.
 
I was making some research on the Feature Suggestions Board and was able to find this idea which is asking for the same.
 
However, it was categorized as "Not Currently Planned", which means that this feature will not be released on Fitbit Surge. Feel free to check the status comment for more details about this.

Shann, Did you get a resolution to this? Like you, I would also like to have two devices. I have had the One for over a year and love it, but I'm going on a cruise in a few weeks, and the Flex makes a whole lot more sense with all the water activities, etc.  I would love to be able to switch back and forth. Also, if I do have to change to the new device, do I lost the data I have accumulated for the past year?  Thanks.
Question is to what extent the drinking affects the positive sides of deep sleep. I guess there is a reason why sleep researchers who struggle to find ways of increasing your deep sleep haven't told you to start drinking.
Can the fitbit read your sleep time without you putting in the hours you tried to sleep? So in other wards if i'm just not sure and i put in a 12 hour period, will it still show wake and sleep cycles accurately?

if you are extra tired, its your body telling you its not getting enough rest. You don't necessarily have to sleep. just laying with your eyes closed and your mind shut off (or as close as you can come) for a half hour could restore you a bit so you feel more rested. I completely understand about not rocking the sleep boat- if I take a nap, I will go to bed later than my optimal bed time for falling asleep quickly (staying asleep is something else entirely). So on days I feel like I just need to rest- I set the timer for 30 minutes and just lay quietly.. it really does help.

Yeah, that doesn't make much sense.  I have always heard eight hours is optimal.
I have such a bad habit of using my phone in bed. And I know that it's stopping me from sleeping. But there's just too much to do, too many people to chat to, I can't seem to break the habit! Even checking how the Fitbit challenges are going keeps me picking it up, and as a result getting up in the morning is a nightmare. And, because I work from home, I don't technically *have* to get up early - but I always feel sluggish all day if I don't. *Sigh*
The same thing happened to mine.  How do we get the sleep stages back?  (deep/light/REM)I find that important to me.
I think I move some during my sleep and also move to accommodate a cat that gets on and off bed etc. I put fitbit into sleep mode when getting into bed and undo when get out of bed for the day. I do the log for thehours on computer.  It has been recording 13 amd more awakenings?  I don't think I wake up that often.  Any suggestions as to what this means...
First, I love the Fitbit. The only problem is I can’t sleep with that either. I was up all night for several days, thinking it was just middle-aged issues. I after several days of being up-and-down all night, I thought maybe I should try taking the Fitbit off during the night. What are you know! I’ve been sleeping successfully for the past four days! I don’t know what causes the restless sleep with the Fitbit and maybe it’s not happening to everyone, but it totally was real for me. Have always been a very heavy sleeper until I wore the Fitbit during the night.
I think the sleep cycle information from my charge 2 is great. Since it knows what cycles I was in and for how long. I know that waking up during REM sleep or deep sleep leaves you feeling groggy and tired, whereas waking up during light sleep leaves you feeling refreshed. I think it would be great if you could input what time you need to wake up (or even a time period like between 6am and 8am), and then fitbits alarm goes off when you are in light sleep. Or at least at the best time possible based on the data it has. This would really save me as I always tend to get a restful sleep, but wake up at the wrong time and feel tired anyway.  Thanks for reading 😊
I would be thrilled to get 6 hours asleep a night, my average is 3.5. And that is with resting/sleeping in the afternoon before going to work, where i get an hour or two. No overthecounter medication ever helped me get to sleep or as you point out, stay asleep, not even prescription ambien and the like. Don't know the answer but do know that i am so envious of those, (like my 22 year old son) who can sleep and sleep, and sleep THROUGH  anything!! Everything wakes me up!!! Well if you find the solution do let me know!!ma
Hey John, If you used to sleep well and suddenly you don't it could be a vitamin deficiency or hormone changes.  If you check out Robb Wolf's Paleo podcast (it's free to download but not sure which episode numbers apply to this topic) he talks many times in his podcasts about sleep and how diet and hormonal imbalances can greatly affect your sleep patterns.  It might be something really simple like adding a multivitamin or a mini dose of testosterone so check out his podcast and talk to your doctor about getting some tests run.  His podcast is very fitness oriented and inspiring.
Totally! I don't wear it during sleep but my resting heart rate tracks very closely with illness, often including a peak prior to illness onset like you described. There are occasional times when it goes up a little without me getting sick, but I'd say 100% of the time that I've been sick my heart rate has been elevated. I had a prolonged illness this summer (flu followed by sinus infection) and it went very high and stayed up the whole time I was sick. I could see my heart rate dropping as I started to get better - gave me hope! I'm also a scientist BTW
@tam94131  Which device do you have? My Charge allows me to either use auto sleep tracking or to use the button to manually put it into sleep. Read this article about sleep - click Welcome to the forums.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
If you use your tracker in sleep mode you shouldn't have to manually enter your sleep time at all.  All you do is enter sleep mode (which is different depending on your tracker) and exit sleep mode when you wake up in the morning.  When you sync next it should automatically enter your tracked sleep into the fitbit website for you.  I hope that helps!
(Update to previous posts)  Much to my surprise, after 2 months of no sleep score calculations on my Alta HR, they magically started appearing again on 7/20/20.  I made no changes with how the device is worn, etc.  I'm assuming a Fitbit update was made that fixed this problem in older devices.  Whatever the reason, it's helpful to see the sleep score again and I hope it continues for more than 2 days.
I'm new to fitbit but tonight will be my first sleep log night. I have sleep apnea where I used to stop breathing for 15 seconds or more many, many times during the night. I got a CPAP and now sleep really good but curious how my vitals and breathing are now. To answer your question, maybe it isn't fitbit but you may have apnea. You might want to get tested. My oxygen levels were down to 55% during the night but now are 98%. Apnea is a silent killer that most people have never heard of... Get tested. Fitbit may have just saved your life...
Hi There,I noticed that if I not sync my fitbit everyday, I am losing data about my sleep. Is this normal behaviour or a bug?  Is there something l can do, so my fitbit will remember my sleep info even if I will not sync it everyday ?

Hi, don't panic, you can log your sleep manually easily enough.To put your fitbit into sleep mode, you need to tap it twice until you get two flashing,lights which then fade away, and to wake it you need to rapidly tap it in the morning
I sometimes get that if I do cardio within a few hours of going to sleep. As long as I feel well rested in the morning, I don't worry about it.

My wife's Charge 3 tracked her sleep every night. After the band broke and she lost it, I got her a Charge 5. The Charge 5 rarely ever tracks her sleep and when it does, it's only a partial night. Somethings going on with the new sensors or software and Fitbit isn't talking.

Thanks for this. I REALLY don’t like the score/grade (years of teaching perhaps?) ... seems ridiculous to make meaningful data so difficult to find now. Not a helpful change!!
Hi @Blair1966,This is an interesting one. I looked back at some of the posts, and it appears that Sleep Stages began being released March of 2017 through May of 2017. It was a progressive roll-out.What is the first day that you're able to see sleep stages?Have you tried viewing it in the Fitbit app?

I would love to work on in the morning! But I have class and the gym where I live doesn't open until 9 a.m.So, yep. Afternoon or early evening is the only option.However, like yesterday, I'm so tired from work or going to school that I come home and crash.

Yes me! I'm often tired and have memory problems and that's why I got a fitbit with a detailed sleep tracker. However I'm really alarmed at how little rem and deep sleep I seem to be getting! I've tried all the sleep hygiene tips I can find on the net, and been following Paul McKenna's book but it's still as bad. I'm hoping that the fitbit sleep tracker is inaccurate as I don't know what else I can do. I really don't think I suffer from sleep apnoea. I'd love to know others experiences.
In most countries the fitbit online store sells these (see link at the top of this page).
I looked that up too. I have felt for a long time that I have sleep issues. I snore horribly and wake up feeling tired, and am tired through the day. I bought a Fitbit blaze four days ago and having been tracking my sleep. I wake up 2-3 times a night and am restless on an average 19.5 times. And This is after taking Xanax to help me sleep! (Ambien and the like have terrible side effects for me). I feel that for me "restless" is more than turning over because my covers are all twisted when I wake up. I plan to take my findings to my doctor to see what can be done to help me sleep better.
Welcome to the forums! Just bought charge 3 .. a lot of problems ..Sleep function for 2 days he only records sleep during 2 hours .. I sleep a lot longer but he does not register this .. how is this? Moving this to the sleep forum where you will get a better answer

Do you track your sleep time?     There are nights when I am so tired I forget to click my Fit Bit One to track my sleep time.   But when I do I find it has greatly helped me to realize my sleep patterns and how to make adjustments to feel better during the day.How has this sleep tracker helped you?
In my view, the 3 most important sleep score measures should be the total time in REM, Deep Sleep, and the total amount of time spent in uninterrupted sleep. The best sleep science is clear that 7 hours of high-quality uninterrupted sleep is critical for maintaining basic physical and emotional health and wellness. What are your thoughts? For example, did you know that:“Regular poor sleep puts you at risk of serious medical conditions, including obesity, heart disease and diabetes – and it shortens your life expectancy.“It’s now clear that a solid night’s sleep is essential for a long and healthy life.”Source: A 'catastrophic sleep-loss epidemic' is killing us, warns leading scientist
I've had sleep tests done, and the FitBit matches the results of the doctor's tests, so it's pretty reliable. If you are getting "restless" feedback, you may want to check in w/ your doctor to see if you should have a sleep test performed. Sleeping w/ a machine can make a world of difference in your life, especially energy!  Good luck!
I’m trying the trial of premium just to see if the additional info is beneficial, so far I’m left with more questions than answers. Help explain why one night was 88 and the other 52?!

Hello @Lindamariebooth  First I moved this post to the section about Sleep Well.Second I think there is no hard number, basically restorative sleep happens when you are below your resting heart rate, even 1 or 2 BPM is enough. Of course this is not the only factor having an influence, and I guess we are not even sure of the causation here, just that there is a correlation between being well restored and heart rate below resting heart rate while sleeping.

I have not noticed a difference is sleep being recorded. But then. I don’t wear it loose at night. I want contact with wrist so it records properly.

This bug is still happening to me, over 2 years later. I've noticed a very clear pattern where it shows an abnormal overnight spike only when I exercise earlier in the day - it appears to be something simple like the X axis is overlapping and transposing the exercise heart rate on to the time when I'm asleep
My Versa 2 does not properly track my sleep. Some nights I get a Sleep Score and details like REM, Deep Sleep, and the various stages of sleep. But on most nights, I just get rudimentary data on a basic "sleep pattern" screen with no Sleep Score and no stages details. I have had it over a month and still don't have a Sleep Profile created, because it hasn't even properly logged 14 nights of sleep. I've spoken to customer support a couple of times now with no good results. Here's what support has had me try that hasn't worked. I've tried restarting the device, resyncing to my phone, changing the sleep sensitivity from normal to sensitive, and tried moving the device farther up my arm a bit, away from the wrist bone. These haven't improved my results. Has anyone else had these issues with Versa 2? Any recommendations or remedies, or maybe I just have a lemon device? Thank you!
Hi I tried this but the Health & Fitness “sleep” tab “open” button at the bottom wasn’t highlighted so I could do nothing with it.

This morning (after not logging anything Sunday into Monday) it broke up my night sleep into 3 hours and change, and then another 2.5 hours with a 2 hour gap unaccounted for. Based on the number of people reporting issues with sleep tracking, across devices, it seems to be a larger problem.
Are you tired during the day?  Does your doctor think you aren't getting enough sleep?  If you're getting 6 solid hours of sleep per night, seems to me like you're doing well.  Some people just don't need as much sleep as others, and we require less as we age.  Note:  I'm not an expert, but I function on an average of 4 hours of sleep per night.  When I get 5+, I'm doing great. My sister, just 2 years younger than I (we're both in our 50's)  needs 8 or 9 hours of sleep per night to feel rested.
I've had it track small portions of sleep but nothing under an hour
Which device you use?

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
It is 12:22 at night and just woke up for the second night in a row from a crazy nightmare and this is the second time I have worn this to bed. When I woke up it was the first thing I thought of was to take it off. I’m not sleeping with this anymore.
Where did you find the settings choice of normal or sensitive?  I just bought mine and am confused about setting my preference. Mine is a fit bit flex.  I so far have learned how to turn it on and sync by double tapping it.  I don't know how to tell if it is charged or if dying either. Lol. No read out but dots..what does it allmean?  There were no real instructions in the packaging either!
Thanks Dave.So Fitbit told me to restart it. It's made no difference at all. So disappointed that now I can't monitor my sleep as previous. I've only had it 6 weeks and haven't done anything any different, so what's up with it? 🙁
I tried my new Fitbit last night to track my sleep and here are the results: Desktop:  Mobile:            As you can see, I have 90% sleep efficiency and slept for over 7 hours. These numbers I expected. However, there are a bunch of periods when I'm "awake" (according to the desktop version) or "restless" (according to the mobile version). I remember being awake as shown by the mobile version because I actually got out of bed. I don't remember the other, restless, moments. My questions are: How bad is it to be restless? "Restless" is a pretty bad word if we're talking about sleep.Should I be concerned about having so many restless moments?What exactly are these restless moments?What does normal, healthy, sleep look like in one of these graphs?Why does the desktop version label restlessness as awake?  Why does the mobile version make the distinction between restless and awake?Any insight about these items is greatly appreciated!
So my average resting heart rate while I am sleeping during normal hours (9:30pm til 5 am) varies between 70-72 bpm- pretty consistant, but after I wake up and get my hubs off to work- i go back to bed about 5:30am and sleep until time for me to get up for work (about 1 hour later) and my bpm drops to 60-62 bpm during that last hour.... weird??  any thoughts as to why so low during that last hour?  also noticed that if I ever nap on my lunch hour it does the same thing- even into the 50's during the nap.  Just curious if anyone else has that happen?
9/7 Update:
Thanks everyone for your patience while we investigated this issue. We acknowledge there was an abnormally high number of users not receiving sleep stages since this past weekend. Our team has confirmed this issue has since been resolved. It's still possible for users to receive the simplified sleep patterns due to the reasons mentioned in this help article. Thanks again for your patience and understanding.
 
9/5 Update:
 
Hi, everyone! I know many of you still haven't received their Sleep Stages, beginning since this past weekend. Our team is actively investigating the root cause and we hope to have this fixed for you all soon. I'm going to close this thread and would like to re-direct you all to your tracker's thread for future updates.
 
If you own a Blaze, Charge 2, or an Alta HR. Please follow or subscribe to those threads for updates on this issue with Sleep Stages. I will keep those up to date with any new information. 
 
Thanks everyone for your cooperation! We really appreciate your patience. 
 
9/4 Update:
We are continuing to investigate this issue, and understand that some of you are still not seeing Sleep Stages. Thanks again for your patience while we work toward a resolution. Here are some answers to questions that have come up around the issue:
 
Q: Is there something wrong with my tracker? Does my tracker need to be replaced?
A: No, there is nothing wrong with your tracker. This is a bug within Fitbit's sleep system.
 
Q: Am I not receiving Sleep Stages because of my app version or tracker firmware version?
A: No, this is not directly related to your tracker or app. This is a bug within Fitbit's sleep system.
 
Q: Do I need to contact Fitbit to get this resolved?
A: No, you do not need to contact Support. This issue is not specific to any accounts, and we are working to get it resolved for all customers.
 
Q: When will I see Sleep Stages again?
A: We are working hard to implement a fix for this top-priority issue, and hope to have it resolved as quickly as possible. We will update this thread as soon as we have more definitive information.

We are aware of an issue that resulted in some customers receiving Classic Sleep graphs rather than Sleep Stages over the past few nights.
 
We apologize for the inconvenience, and our team is looking into this to prevent it from recurring.
how do you fix the fitbit sleep mode
Totally agree: need a happier medium! 🙂 Meridith

"how do I bring that number of minutes down? I really want to get more solid sleep." -KatelynI had sleep problems.  These are the two most signfiancat thin gs anyone can do to have better sleep for a shoerter overall sleep duration. 1. Set your alarm clock to go off the same time everyday. When it goes off, get out of bed and start your day.  If you have 'sleep in days' (i.e Saturday and Sunday)  set your alarm for no more than an hour later than your normal wake-up time. (You can program this into your FitBit 🙂2. Get the same amount of sleep-time every night.   Beyond that, my techniques are more complex and are distant in effectiveness to #1 and #2. Once you get into a routine with #1 and #2, you can slowly reduce the duration of #2. According to FitBit, my average total sleep time per night is 5.3 hours. I rarely need my alarm to wake me up nor do I need my sleep in days.
In scientific papers, 'sleep efficiency' means the time you actually sleep, divided by the time you have spent in bed. So if you have a sleep depriving disease such as sleep apnea, you will fall asleep really quick (you are tired most of the time), and you "efficiency" can be a high percentage.
how do I compare my sleep results to others.  It seems I am restless about 50% of the night.  Is that consistent with most people?
Welcome to the Fitbit Community, @DaughterAnn and thanks @JohnnyRow for the information provided.
 
@DaughterAnn If you use the option Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app, you'll get the simplified sleep details. As @JohnnyRow said above, just wear your Fitbit device when you go to sleep so you can get sleep stages and sleep score. You can find more details on this help article.
 
See you around.

What is meant by Restless?  I keep track of my sleep but don't know what that is telling me about my sleep.What might number of times imply.?  Does restless mean just changing position in bed or what?
can someone help me manually log my sleep the morning after?  I put down the time I went to bed under "entered bed field" then the time I woke under "left bed field" I don't know if I should use same day/previous day and what is the 12 hr and 2 hr mean? After I enter the times it says I was in bed 19 hrs.
Do you know if you snore? I was tested years ago and found out that I have mild sleep apnea. I never got around to treating it because some life circumstances got in the way, but I'm finally going to a sleep clinic in October.My sleep apnea shows up on my FitBit charts only a couple times a week, if that. When it does, it's about once or twice a night. Sleep apnea can still cause cardiovascular and cognitive issues even without daytime sleepiness, so it might be worth it to get it checked out if that's what your charts look like considering mine barely register anything. My apnea occurs mostly during REM sleep.
In Health Metrics, for Heart Rate Variability and Oxygen Saturation, the shaded part of graph is labeled "in personal range" so is just based on you own recent history to highlight your personal outliers, with no implication of what is normal or typical for other people.Restlessness is under Sleep, not Health Metrics.  For me it give the % and says "That's about normal for your age and sex."That's all I know about that.  Are you looking for a chart of what the normal % would be for all ages and sexes?  I have no idea where to find that, but would probably take an extensive internet research project.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
When I attempt to alter, or to enter new data for a specific day on the PC app, I get this error: Sleep log must be between 10 and 1440 minutes.No matter what hour of "sleep beginning" and/or "sleep ending" I type in I get that error. It's very frustrating. Typically, when I enter sleep and wake times it's because I missed a day; i.e., I wasn't wearing my Versa.  Anyone have suggestions on this error?

Just turned 50 years old woman, I am exercising pretty regularly to help my insomnia.   Took benedryl to sleep at home plus 5 mg of melatonin, but I still wake up in the morning wired!!! I am averaging 5 to 6 hours sleep at night.    What can I do to improve my sleep, I know I am going through perimenopaus symptoms.  Sometimes the lack of sleep does not make me want to exercise the next day, since I am very tired.  Any women out there could help me with this issue?   Very much appreciated for your suggestions and feedback to improve quality of sleep.
Just checked under stages of sleep and nothing showing on my Versa Fitbit. I am anxious to see thisshow up as I believe my oxygen level may be low while sleeping.  I wish Fitbit were a bit more concise on how they communicate these type of things.  Do we just keep checking to see if it shows up?
Hey there. I just joined. I usually drink some melatonin pills when I have problems sleeping and also eat cbd gummies. I have been using melatonin pills because I have been traveling a lot and my sleeping schedule has been really wonky the past couple of years. But it was not the best decision medically as I later found out from my doctor. He suggested some alternatives one of which was CBD infused products since in some people they helped with sleeping issues. I agreed to give it a go and started using CBD gummies. I switched many different brands before setting for one called Koality Medicinals. I liked them the most because they very accessible I was able to order them online whenever I wanted and they were very chewy in comparison to some other brand that I tried. I have been using them for the past few months and they did help with my sleeping patterns. I am really happy and I hope my story will be of some us to you guys.
Hi @WilsonFitbit! Thank you for taking the time to string out suggestions, I think the overloading part of the brain is definitely one of my main stressors which is why my workload. I also read an article about blue light, which probably explains my difficulty in sleeping because my work is heavily dependent on my laptop haha.  I did try getting out of bed when I can't sleep and just jogging in place–basically tiring myself out. Works like a charm so far! 😁
I was diagnosed with sleep apnea almost 10 years ago (I believe it was around 26 AHI). I had my last sleep study about 2 years ago, still had it (though to a lesser extent-14 AHI). I believe I have minor sleep apnea at the moment.I was prescribed a CPAP machine but I found it impossible to sleep with. Instead I'm hoping that I can lose enough weight and that will have an effect on it.In my non-medical opinion you can tell an apneic episode by the short (about 1 minute) arousals shown in the above graph. They're hard to tell but they are there if you look closely. As you can see in my sleep pattern every deep sleep stage it is interrupted by a light pink "awake" stage which then proceeds to a light sleep stage.
Don't feel bad, I'm just getting started with my Fitbit and I don't even see where my sleep efficiency is reported. Where should I look?
Very irritating.  I've been waiting forever to be able to see it on mine.  I wish they would do beta testing differently.  i.e. let people sign up for some sort of early adopter program instead of what the heck they are doing currently.  Doesn't make sense.  Especially if there are those that are avid fans of the devices and platform. SMH
Firstly, hey all. New Versa 3 owner.. first question. I have two 50lb dogs that crash with me on the bed at night. Will their movements affect my sleep tracking? I'm wearing the watch and don't have snore detection. I'm thinking it will but not sure. Cheers.
You're correct.  It is the percent of time you were actually sleeping compared to how long you were in bed.  I would say 92% is good, I'm usually in the 30-40% range :(.

Why is my sleep not being recorded
Hi @NGW, You would take screenshots of the screens you want to share, then email them to your doctor. Another method, which may work better if you have access to a computer and printer, is to visit your account via the Web Dashboard at fitbit.com (Dashboard link). From there, go to Log, then Sleep, and you'll see all the sleep charts. I find them easier to print full-size from the web dashboard. Hope this helps.

I have a Fitbit Blaze and I have noticed that while it records (as best as it can) my nightly sleep it seems to not record if I take an hour nap in the mid day.  As an Example today, I took a nap around 5 PM to 7 PM but it is not showing even with several syncs.  Anyone have any ideas?

fitbit reports how long it took you to go to sleep, but ignores that time in the calculation.  If you go to bed at 10pm and read for an hour falling asleep at 11 pm, it will report it took you an hour to fall asleep, but start the efficiency calculations at 11pm.
@DebbkatYou should be able to go to whatever day's sleep log and edit it. On the computer's dashboard, go to the right of the sleep log. Run your mouse over it and you'll see a pencil for edit and for delete, a big X. Edit as needed.

Set your fitbit on normal instead of sensitve and track that sleep log for a week, then compare.  When I have mine set to sensitive, it says I sleep about 4.5 hours a night, and wake up at least 22 times, sometimes as much as 45 or more! When I put it on "normal" it says I sleep about 7 hours a night.  I do wake up a lot, but usually I can go back to sleep within 5 minutes or less; I know I am a little bit of a restless sleeper. One night a week I sleep really well. The rest of the week not so much. So, see if that helps, and talk to a doctor if you feel that tired.
So I did the following to get the sleep tracking working :- removed my (unused now, but still paired) old Charge HR and the new HR2 from my dashboard- reset the HR2 and re-added / paired it back- in the dashboard, Charge HR2 options, ensured SLEEP TRACKING is set to "Normal"Maybe it's too early to tell, but for the past week I have HR2 tracking the sleep and the stages very accurate. Much better than my Samsung Gear S3, btw. I'm a happy camper.
I also wear my Fitbit pretty loose and I haven't noticed this changes. I do know that you can have little deep sleep if you have insomnia. Since this might be caused by stress, anxiety, depression, poor sleep habits, circadian rhythm disorders (such as jet lag), and taking certain medications.
 
Since during deep sleep, you become less responsive to outside stimuli and breathing slows and muscles relax; heart rate usually becomes more regular. The thinking parts of the brain are largely offline. Your muscles are very relaxed. You’re not dreaming at all during this time. Your body is doing a lot of rebuilding and repairing. That's why very important check if insomnia is affecting your deep sleep. During this time our body secretes growth hormone, which is associated with cellular rebuilding and repair too. 
 
Work out daily and eat more fiber during the day might help you to get a better score in your deep sleep. Also try to avoid caffeine around 7+ hours before bed. 😉

To be clear, does the fitbit ecosystem registers this period as a logged sleep cycle? Which model do you have? My unit doesn't do that.

	One cannot get wet by the word water; they'd need to touch the water. One cannot get fit by merely thinking about exercise; they'd need to get up and do something.
It would be nice if any of the Fitbit bands supported this feature, but they don't. Consider adding your vote to the feature request!
Hi I recently encountered an interesting observation. I treat people with AF and one of my patients had an ablation procedure which converted him to sinus rhythm. He wears a fitbit all the time and he noticed that before the ablation when he was in AF the fitbit was not displaying his sleep stages at all and now suddenly it is able to chart all his sleep stages. What information does the fitbit use to determine sleep stages?
Do you feel like you wouldn't have made the same effort if it wasn't for your fitbit ? Would an alarm clock and a regular schedule have the same effect, or are the features of your fitbit making a difference ?
im not sure how accurate it is. I wake up for a few seconds many many times every night, to either turn or for whatever. But i will sleep back sometimes very quick, but someones 2-3 mins, would my efficiency still be over 85% so easily? Restless counts as me waking up for those few seconds/minutes?
Hi, @Bearbrook! I haven't noticed the same issue. If you're game, you could try uninstalling and reinstalling your app and seeing if that helps!

I use tart cherry juice a little bit before going to bed.
It's been bugging me for a while that my fitbit flex tells me that I, on average, have about 2.5 - 3 hours of restless sleep every night - even when I don't drink alcohol at all for extended periods (up to 3 months) and eat well and exercise. Keep in mind I only put my fitbit on as I'm turning off the lights to sleep - not wearing it all day. So I started going through my history and I noticed that prior to April 26, 2015 (yes, 2015) I was only restless about 15-20 min every night. I can't find any firmware updates that happened at that time and there's no corresponding major life event for me (of which I'm aware). So, literally overnight, my sleep has seem to gone down the drain. Looking forward to people's insights here and thanks in advance for your contributions.

Welcome @jb00266, From what I know, sleeping pills can increase light sleep and decrease REM. From this article: "There are two types of sleep: REM, when people dream, and non-REM, which has light, medium and deep portions. Sleeping pills mainly increase the amount of medium-depth non-REM sleep, Dr. Buysse said."

Currently, in the sleep log, average hours slept can be viewed on a weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. It would be great if you could also view average time in REM, deep sleep, time awake, etc. over the same timeframes. This would enable users to try to identify patterns, and implement behavioural change to improve these metrics. i.e. you could look for changes in diet, activity levels, medication changes, supplements, etc. to see how these might be impacting sleep. Thank you!
@Timtimtimtim  I would recommend you to not buy any Fitbit if you want to monitor your sleep patterns with some degrees of accuracy. None of the Fitbit are particularly accurate for this and you also need to buy a Premium membership to see sleep pattern details. If it is the one feature that matters, then buy a dedicated sleep tracker device that does only that. The Oura ring seems to be getting constant good reviews for this.https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-sleep-trackers
My Inspire 2 has an option to turn on/off 24 hour heart rate monitoring (a battery preservation thing)  If I turn 24/7 HR to "off" it does a paired down sleep tracking, w/o sleep stages or sleep score. This got me too.  The HR has to be set to 'On' for full sleep tracking. @eezeepee
I have the same concerns.  Sensitive seems too sensitive, but normal doesn't seem sensitive enough... haven't come up with a good solution.
On two different occasions, my fitbit force has shaken with do display about an hour before my alarm was set to go off. It only shakes once. But it happens two or three times before my alarm is set to go off. There is no display and nothing displays except the time I've been asleep in the diaplay when I push the button. Any ideas?Jim
While I'd agree that it's not extremely accurate,,a sensor on the wrist can't generate the rigorous scientific detail of a sleep study.   IMO it's more of a guideline.    I think you can get a relative idea of your sleep on a given night compared to other nights.
We had the same problem for my wife's Fitbit charge 3. Mine worked hers did not. We hooked up the charging cable then pushed on the side button (cutout on charging clip) for 8 sec and then you get a smiley face, this is a reset of your Fitbit. This fixed the issue with my wife's Fitbit and she now gets a sleep score. The reset did not fix the issue with not registering sleep until approx 2 hrs after we actually go to bed, and trust me my wife is out like a light within 10 min or so. This supposedly is a know issue for both Charge 3 & 4 Fitbits

Yes but you infer actions by observations. You can by by summarizing movements predict if a person is sleeping or merely watching TV.
I found this interesting.  I'm on two antidepressants and one makes me jittery.  I had 19 "restless" moments and 5 "wakeful" during my 9 hours of sleep last night. I am considering talking to my doctor about changing my meds if this is consistent.
@KimHill  What a rewarding job you must have. I can't answer for Fitbit, but I know people have raised funds for such worthy causes as this one on GoFundMe, which can be found on this link. If you set up one there, please let us know. I'm sure there are people here who would like to help out, too. Welcome to the forums. Please keep in touch.

This is the 2nd time it has happened in 2 weeks of owning my HR2. Does anyone else get that message?  I slept well and nothing was recorded.

I know that they said the sleep score would only be available for premium, but they released it to the public yesterday.
Score of 89! Went to bed at 11:04 and woke up at 5:17.  Awake 30 min REM 2:01 hrLight 2:25 hrDeep 1:17 hr It's interesting that despite the few hours of sleep I still managed a high sleeping score, probably because I spent a lot of time at a low resting heart rate (94% below resting heart rate).
Hello. I have had my Versa 2 for over 2 years. Just recently it stopped tracking my sleep and also my heartrate. I have uninstalled the app, reset my phone, reset my Versa and still nothing. I have even tightened my band to where it is snug. What can I do?
 
Moderator Edit: Clarified subject
Though not officially recommended by Fitbit, what I have found is you can get shorter naps counted by using the 'Begin Sleep Now' button, which really is intended for trackers without heart rate monitors to recognize sleep.On phone app, click Sleep tile, then + (plus sign) at top right, then 'Begin Sleep Now'; when you wake up, click "I'm Awake" or some such message.  If you do have heart rate detecting model, this is best used only when you expect to nap less than one hour.

HI there,I have been noticing that the sleep score I am getting does not reflect the actual night's sleep.For instance, I have scored an 85 of sleep score on a night in which I had a major migraine, got up, took a pill, went to the bathroom, sat on the bed for some time, rolled on the bed with pain... And fitbit recorded me sleeping and hit an 85 of sleep score. HOW?On other occasions, I have had good hours of sleep, wake up rested and the sleep score registers 70ish or less. How?Cheers,Rita
Melatonin isn't a sleeping medication.It's a circadian timing of when to sleep.Doses of 300 mcgs for using to help set your sleep time to early or later. Melatonin is naturally produce in the darkness of night whether you sleep or are awake. Sleep is natural and important to your well-being and for those that don't sleep well it's best to try and find the source of why not. You cannot force yourself to sleep and you need to find what time is your natural time to sleep and wakeup refreshed plus able to function well the next day. Melatonin can be taken in the morning to help (but there's little evidence that it works) or 7-8 hours before bed to help change your bedtime to earlier.Melatonin is used for those with sleep disorders of the circadian clock cycle where someone's sleep is out of sync with the rest of the society yet the use of melatonin for this purpose doesn't have any proof of correcting the sleep wake times. I would say that melatonin serves little use in helping a person to fall asleep. Melatonin can cause nightmares,reduced body temperature,changes to heart rate,sweating,feeling cold and shouldn't be taken by those that are diabetic.
No, I do have the heart rate version tracker. I guess waving my arm around might work but I'm hoping for a more consistent and reliable solution.
Hi @Jeff-King Welcome to the forum and thank you for sharing your thoughts. It's an interesting idea and I'd like to encourage you to post it in the Feature Suggestion forum to see what other think about it.

I don't know if this is normal or not...but my sleep patterns have no pattern.  Some nights I sleep practically straight through, others I appear to wake every 1 1/2 hours or so and then go right back to sleep.  I sleep on my side so I maybe just am flipping sides. I believe staying hydrated is just as important as a good nights sleep. I don't mind having to get up to pee because that gives me a chance for a water break which ironically makes me sleep better.  sweet dreams

Sorry for the late reply! I actually just came across a lot of articles like (I did not actively search for these, I just read a lot of similar articles like these over the years): http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/90-minutes-sleep-cycle.htmlhttps://www.quora.com/Is-the-rule-of-90-minutes-in-sleep-is-myth-or-true So that's why I'm curious as to how much I'm actually sleeping given Fitbit's awake time.
Try turning the Bradley bracelet around so that the catch is on the inside of your wrist.that works for me. Good luck.Sent from Samsung tablet
Please post link to blog.  I'm very interested as a longtime flier and effects on sleep.  Used to travel more frequently in the past, however, this year been flying between time zones on 3 continents now armed with a new more interactive wearable.
Last nights sleep was set to sensitive, the other's were normal. If I set it on sensitive some nights it's saying I'm getting very little sleep.  Once last week it actually told me I only slept for 1 and a half hours for a whole night.  On average when the tracker is set to normal, it's saying I wake up 25 x a night.  I'm very restless at night and that has been confirmed by my hubby too.  I do suffer with Chronic pain in my back and my hips though (unmedicated) and that is what causes my quality of sleep to go down so much.  I always wondered why I was so tired throughout the day and now thanks to Fitbit I do.This is the last nights in more detail. As you can see, I'm not getting anywhere near as much sleep as I should be getting.
Are you okay with your average sleep time being 5.3 hours. Just thinking about it gives me a headache and my body feels sleep deprived. LolGet Outlook for iOS
Hey there, @AmyMomOf3! Welcome to the Family!
 
You have a great question here. Actually, you should be able to see those stats after editing your sleep logs. Is this happening every time you edit your sleep? 
 
If so, I think it'd be a good idea to check this with our support team. They might have to check what is happening with your Fitbit.
 
Looking forward to see you again in the near future.

Looks like the Sleep as Android with Fitbit is in beta only and we currently don't have information if it will be released. I'd recommend to post this idea in the Feature Suggestions board so our developers can take it into consideration to implement this for new updates or product development. If you find that a similar suggestion has already been made by another member of the community, you can vote for their idea and add your comments.

Any chance you are deficient in magnesium?  I had assumed I was fine on that front until I found out one of my long term medications creates deficiencies.  I started with one at night and within a couple of days I was sleeping deeply enough to dream.  To be honest I don't think I have done that in decades.  It freaked me out quite a lot but I am used to it now.  Maybe look up the sources and see if you think you are getting enough from your diet. An hour of cycling a day may well warrant a top up.
This is what I bought - pricey, but adjusts flawlessly and also provides massage! It was amazing that by adjusting my neck angle, I woke up less frequently and had no neck or shoulder pain. I used to wake up 4-6 times a night - now, maybe once.
@Suzzi1961 no you do not need to manually enter the start/end time for sleeping.  When you put your Fitbit model into sleep mode it notes the time and when you stop sleeping mode it notes that time as well.  What model Fitbit are you using?  I have had a couple times when on my 1st sync in the morning (after waking up) my sleep tile (on my iPhone Fitbit App) was showing "no sleep recorded" but later in the day it populated with my data. If you forget you can also manually enter sleep data (start / end times) on the dashboard.  Not sure if this will give the same graph (restless / awake time) since you are inputting it manually and I have never had to do it myself.  Hope this helps.
As far as I know, you can't.
Valid point. Thanks

Hi @WilsonFitbit, the best help would be the option to disable Bluetooth on the device (like an airplane mode) as suggested in https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/Ability-to-disable-Bluetooth-in-restricted-areas... and  https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/Airplane-mode-for-Charge-3/idi-p/2751664 and https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/Airplane-Mode-for-Sense/idc-p/4736518#M264198 and many, many other feature suggestions since more than 6 years. 🙂 I feel like the only way to not even wear the FitBit at all to avoid sleeping problems is not a really satisfying sultion.

Based on the information in Sleep Well, I wanted to sign up to Get More Sleep but I cannot open the Programs with instructions (sorry, my app is in German so apologies if that's not the exact name). It just says there's been an error and try again later. This started about 12 hours ago. I have tried to access the program via the web Community but get the error above. I have turned off and on again both my phone and Inspire 2 but to no avail. Any ideas please? As you can probably see, any help getting to sleep would be really useful. Thanks a lot, Claire

Hi, @blew888, unfortunately not.  If you don't have a Fitbit that tracks sleep, you won't have it available on the website. Why not get in touch with Customer Support on contact.fitbit.com ?  Let them know that you have lost your Flex and that you are disappointed that your other Fitbit, the Zip doesn't track sleep.  I know that they often are able to offer loyal customers a discount on a new Fitbit if they have lost their tracker and are thinking of upgrading.  I can definitely recommend the Flex 2. Good luck, and let us know how it goes.

I have PTSD.  I can keep contious control of it during the day, but at night i can't.  i am vary restless, and i move around a lot.  Does anyone have any good suggestions about how i can deal with this?
I have had the Ionic for over 6 months and never had any problems with it. Within the last week or so, when I look at sleep time it will show (for example: 7 hr 6 min) when I click on it to look at it more in depth, it will switch to a lesser amount ( for example: 6 hr 23 min).....it has only recently started doing this....any idea why?
I talked to customer service and the Surge will be included.
How can I make the One add up multiple sleep periods in 1 day when showing total sleep for that day?
I’ve had a Fitbit for years and recently noticed a friend (who had just got one) has much better sleep than me from comparing sleep analysis. Hers is mainly dark blue whereas I’m usually spending most of the night in light blue. I assumed it was just she’s a better sleeper than me. But when I take it off I have a much deeper more satisfying sleep (sadly just don’t have the analysis to review!). Another colleague visited his chiropractor and was surprised to find he was stronger in his arm when he took them fitbit off?!?!? Very odd but something isn’t going nowhere on with the Bluetooth and the nervous system
Hi @Morganwall Welcome to the forum. Overall, how are you feeling? Have you been under a lot of stress? I see my resting heart rate increase when I'm dealing with a lot of stress. I use the breathing exercise on my Fitbit to help me relax in the evening. Also walking in the evening, may be of help if it is stress. An increase in your resting heart rate could be a symptom of a lot of different things, so it's hard to sort out without more information. 

Marci | Bellevue, WA
Sounds like you have it set on "sensitive". There is a "normal" mode that will be more true to "awake" times only and remove a lot of the noise of just rolling over. Check the settings for your device.
Thanks for the tip Marci.  I actually have the original Charge. Got it years ago but only started using it recently. Been using my Zip for years though. But I wanted to start tracking my sleep so I pulled the Charge out and began using it.I found the manual for my model and have reset it. Won't know until tomorrow morning if it is working correctly. It keeps telling me I'm getting something like 3 hours and 9 minutes of sleep and was awake 4 hours and 7 minutes when I know for certain I slept through the night with two short bathroom breaks.Very frustrating because it was working fine before the time change.
I have trouble getting deep sleep too. I maybe hit the benchmark once a week for deep sleep. It's only after a day where I did decent cardio getting heart rate to target range 20-30 minutes. Sometimes I also sleep better if I've been deprived of sleep the day before. Wish I knew the magic trick. Good luck!
Thank you nice to meet you
I was just talking to my wife about.  As I have not slept for more than 6 hours (and I am happy when that happens) for a long, long time.  I am fearing that this may be true.
I've been using sleep stages for about five months with no problems. Suddenly sleep stages of disappeared. I am sleeping more than three hours, my battery is fully charged, I'm sleeping in a normal position. There is something wrong with the Fit bit application. There is a bug. Please fix it ASAP.
 
Moderator Edit: Clarified subject
and this is where I am getting lost. the HR monitor is what tells it that you are asleep- meaning you have no movement and your HR is at the lowest point within a specified period of time. I always knew - probably incorrectly- that REM is measured by brain activity not HR. Fitbit is recording your movement through out the night and also monitoring your heart rate. It knows that you are asleep because even with some movement your HR doesn't go above the lowest point in the specified time. When it does, it marks you awake. when you settle back down, it marks you asleep and so on. I guess I don't know how it will track REM sleep through your wrist. What am I missing- I am really asking- I can't sleep most notes either so this is very interesting to me.

Elena | Pennsylvania
Based on the chart you hardly sleep. Did you confuse your fitbit by mixing A.M/P.M?  Most probablly your device is either too sensitive or defective. Eitherway even if one is  restless when he/she sleeps what can you do? If it was me I would not worry about it.
Customer service mentioned there is no way to eliminate it at this time. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Health, more/less need for sleep, work time, etc. Should have an opt out option, even a toggle switch like they have for other items on the dashboard. Poor that this was added with no notice or feedback. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Night.
If you forget to turn it on, you can do to the sleep tab and and enter when you went to sleep and when you woke up and it will show you.
It's horrible I know, and lack of sleep makes it harder to manage during the day too.  I muddle through with my structured bedtime routine of bath, meditation / relaxation, and hope for as much sleep as possible.

For those of y'all reporting an issue where your Fitbit tracker is indicating a higher Sleeping HR versus Resting HR, I would love to see a screen shot of your daily heart rate.  Posting a few images like this might well help figure out if the issue is in fact the Fitbit algorithms or if you have a sleep issue which is causing the high heart rate.
My sleep pattern showed 9 awake times and that is with using a sleep apnea machine.@luv2pugs wrote:I've been to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with mild and occasional apnea. I do not see any breaks in my sleep patterns on my fitbit that support that diagnosis. Would it show disruptions in my sleep pattern?
I've been using the fitbit silent alarm, so when I put the alarm on, I know to turn on my sleep at the same time.  As someone else mentioned, it becomes part of the routine, so I don't have to think about it as much anymore either.

Sleep has a profound impact on my ability to lift weights. If I consistently don't get enough sleep, poundage progression slows, then stalls. My resting heart rate will go up 5bpm from normal. Using Fitbit has made it really easy to see the correlation between sleep and workout strength. Getting 8-9 hours of sleep that is contiguous is important to my workout success. If I sleep 6 hours, then try to grab a 2 hour nap, it's not near the same as if I'd slept 8 hours straight through the night.When sleep isn't going well, I've learned it's crticial to back off intensity and/or frequency until the body recovers. There's no "pushing through" bad sleep. Also, of note, is that they body does most of its rebuilding during sleep, as well as release hormones like HGH during deep sleep. Even sleeping the right length, but without enough deep sleep will show up in workout performance also.

Awesome! Thank you.
Great thanks! Good to see that I am above the average of 6 hours 38 mins for everyone, and 6 hours 26 mins for men.
It sure would be nice if our Fitbit DID track HRV... As for the placebo effect - it's real. It does exist. As for me, I never check it because I know what time I go to bed, and what time I wake up. I also remember what time I woke up in the middle of the night because I was either thirsty or had to whiz. Seems like a pointless thing to look at. But, I'm sure that's just me.

I also used to suffer from dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I slept all 8 hours, and it didn’t help me at all. I think the issue was that I used to work night shifts only, and having a lack of daylight also affects your health somehow. Even after I quit that job and had enough sleep at night, I still had dark circles. I tried different creams and gels with a cooling effect, but nothing helped me. I even tried eye-patches, but they don’t work. One day, I accidentally ran across this site — https://absame.org/. They had some simple remedies with green tea bags. I decided to try it since I had some tea at my house. Surprisingly it worked for me, and the solution to my problem was so simple.

What does your sleep pattern look like during the dip?  How snug do you wear your Fitbit?
Did anyone find a fix to this?  Im having the same problem. My iphone wake up alarms are being redirected to buzz my fitbit when im asleep.  This isnt working cause I dont feel the buzzing fitbit when im sleeping.
Inalso have above average REM and lower deep sleep. I'm typically on 28% REM (30 day average) while the normal range is for my age is 15-25%. My deep sleep is a bit lower than average (11%) . I'm a bit worried that I am typically very stressed, not sure if this is the cause or the consequence. Any advice?

Poor sleep has a terrible effect on well-being and performance. In fact, you feel empty. And it can't help but upset during the day. As I mentioned above, I had trouble sleeping for a while. It got to the point that I could not sleep for two days and walk around with terrible bruises under my eyes. When the situation reached a critical point, I decided to contact the counselling service. I came across good specialists who worked with me on the problems that cause insomnia. As it turned out, it was based on nerves and psyche.Therefore, I advise you to solve it now.
 
Moderator edit:  format
I agree with this. I was curious about how accurate my VERSA was logging my sleep stages; so I wore it to a sleep study at the hospital.  Turns out it was way off, I was in REM for 95% of the study with no light or deep sleep.  The tracker said I was in REM for about 20 percent of the time.
Fitbit is definitely not accurate on sleep.  I have sleep apnea.  It tracks my sleep for my Dr. and the Insurance company.  The apnea device shows more sleep and less disturbance. Regarding, your depression issue.  Melatonin, depression meds, various dietary changes, or perhaps get tested for apnea are all possible assistence to your issue.  NOTE: not solutions.
Have you talked to your doctor about this? S/he might be able to give you something that will help you sleep at night. If you'd rather go the drug-free route, perhaps some aromatherapy before bed. (I bought a mix that I put on my wrists, chest, and temples before sleep.) There are also a lot of guided meditation apps that might help you relax. Or maybe you could do a few yoga stretches to help you relax.
Try essential oils! Oils such as lavendar are great for naturally calming down the body and bringing relaxation. I have been using essential oils for a number of months now and have found that they are a great natural alternative for so many different things (health, cleaning, mood, etc.) plus they actually work! Message me for more details
Mine stopped updating when I uploaded the update for Fitbit on my iPhone, first my floors climbed have never worked properly and now my sleep tracking is gone, very disappointed in Fitbit.
I feel you!! I have insomnia and part of the reason I bought the Flex is to see how much sleep I am actually getting. My husband is always saying I sleep a lot but the truth is I wake up A LOT and can remember waking up. Even if this isn't 100% accurate it will give me a better idea of my sleep pattern.

	Being a good steward to this world means loving all your neighbors, not just ones you think have comprehension.
I wouldn't be too concerned about it, @Recycledteen, that will just make you more restless and lose more sleep over it.  There is no "normal" when it comes to sleep as far as I know. Sometimes mine shows 20 to 25 times restless or awak, and other nights it shows only a couple times restless or awake. So many things affect sleep, such as what you ate last, what happened at work that day, a phone call that was either very good or bad, etc., etc., etc..
The beta is full. Too bad wearing a firbit for 8 years doesn't mean anything. (And apparently the forum doesn't even want to let me post this!)

Hi! Saw this post when I was searching similar topics. My toddler is 3 and is experiencing night terror, something similar to sleep walking and occurs at NREM. At this age there is pretty much nothing a doctor can prescribe and no meaningful way of finding out more. But as parents, it is always a dreadful scene to experience and we may occasionally read the situation wrongly. If we attempt to carry her during night terror, it is like waking a sleep walker up, it gets worse. I personally use a fitbit to track my sleep, thus wondering if it is possible for my child so that we can be more informed and also monitor the occurrence. We are not treating this as any form of medical intervention, simply more information. Thanks!
I'm not a medical person, or in any way an expert at interpreting these graphs, but:I would think with problematic sleep apnea, one would expect to see several, perhaps very many, of those peaks per night, not just one or two.  Also keep in mind, the peaks are high variance, which could be either relatively low or high SPO2.That's just my non-expert take on it.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Same here: battery was low, sleep stage tracking worked when it was recharged.
No, no current Fitbit model is able to measure blood pressure.

I downloaded the latest Charge 2 update, and my sleep stages tracking has now disappeared. What happened to it? How do I get it back?
I have to be honest, my mattress sucks, for a lack of better words. I really need to buy a new one. I think it is a combination of my mattress and pillow. The odd thing is though my fitbit says that I am in the restless/awake time. I dont recall being awake or restless...? Is that normal?
Hi @Proartwork  Yes, the new dashboard is slightly different. You'll see a sleep score, too. Your images didn't show up. To post images, you need to upload them to Fitbit.

I see in late April 2021 a number of people could not get their sleep score. It is now Friday 05-14-2021 and I have not had a sleep score since Tuesday 04-11. I have rebooted, have allowed sync time when it appeared to be doing that, I have charged the fitbit, I have not changed how I wear it at night. I need help and the fitbit team is too busy with a problem affecting the service. Is this the problem that is causing my problem? Please help.
Hi Dave,  I absolutely agree with you on the importance of deep sleep.  I wish I knew how to get more.  Some nights I get 30 to 40 minutes deep sleep and have very little energy all day and then boom....I'll have over and hour and a half and feel great and my endurance is greatly enhanced.  Good luck in your quest for a better nights sleep!
Well things are looking a lot better. I didn't wake up once last night. The little patch of blue after the red this morning is me thinking about getting up after the alarm went off.

The graph is super helpful on seeing how much light, deep and REM I am getting, however, I am completely confused when it comes to sleep cycles. I am trying to figure out when to go to bed and am getting this:


9:00 PM (6 cycles, 9h of sleep) - recommended for long-sleepers,




10:30 PM (5 cycles, 7h30m of sleep) - recommended for average-sleepers,




12:00 AM (4 cycles, 6h of sleep) - recommended for short-sleepers
 
But I have no idea how many cycles I get a night. Do I count the peaks? The dips? I hope someone can shed some light. Thanks!

I don't have hypertension or anything like that. But I do have severe daytime fatigue and need three to four cups of coffee before getting through my day, (about two sixteen ounce containers). I forgot to attach this image earlier 🙂
Agreed! I am horrified about being graded and ranked on something that is already a stressful source of angst (and ironically makes it harder to sleep worrying!). Make sleep score optional, it's not a competition.
Where is the feature? I have an Ionic and not able to activate smart awake alarm. What a shame fitbit!
Awesome! My hope this solves the problem.
Thank you for taking the time to try to help.  It just doesnt make sense to me to have to manually open up an app on another device just to ensure Fitbit gets a signal to tell them I am actually now awake and not in the shower!   I expected more from Fitbit than that.  Maybe there is another way?Again thank you much appreciated.
Olana,  yes. I am like you. Never had anything like a fitbit before. 3 nights not sleeping and my husband noticed it started when I got my fitbit. Alta HR. I took it off and then slept normally. Nothing else happened to change my sleep. It must be the fitbit and me. Darn.
fascinating!!! Thank you so much for sharing this! I have an older fitbit without this capability, and this sort of information that is helpful to me. The marketing stuff is just not so useful 😞
So conclusion - I'm not so sure the sleep tracking is as accurate as people claim. I did test positive for narcolepsy and my tracker didn't really pick up REM sleep in the beginning of the night. 🤷‍:female_sign: But I'm now treated with Adderall which i don't necessarily like the idea but it's helped. It's not fool proof because I can still get sleep attacks and cataplexy even with taking the Adderall and Effexor. I couldn't tolerate Provigil. But overall much better! As for the Fitbit, I think it's overall okay at detecting an elevated heart rate and estimating REM based on that - but that's only if it's reading your pulse rate accurately.
7.5-8 hours. I have a good internal body clock so will wake up almost on the dot 8 hours, only sometimes less if I go to bed late, and alarm/dog wakes me up.
Do you mean the setting for sensitivity? Normal (default) or sensitive?If you dont get any restless during your sleep, you could try setting it to sensitive. If your sleep cycle looks okay, you should not change this setting.

Could you not just put in a larger daily target for your calories burned? If you are getting them before you even wake up the target is not very challenging. Another way round this would be to set a target for steps rather than calories. Unless you are a sleepwalker you won't get notified of meeting your target while you are asleep.
Thank you'
It might help to know which Fitbit model you have.

If your budget is low, don’t go with the cheapest option you find. As much as I know, a good mattress is at least $400. Don't go lower because the quality drop-off will be huge.
Pixel says sleep score not recorded due to not having consistent heart rate, go to HR historical data and it shows it actually did have a consistent heart rate all night. Please fix, I've tried all steps available for troubleshooting.
I have the same problem and would appritiate getting help in order to nderstand this data..
Hi Fitbit Community,As the title suggests, I've been having dreams about Fitbit. This started after my Fitbit broke on Saturday, May 14th. I dreamed last night that I had a Surge. I've never owned a Surge, just a Charge — which is broken.I've never dreamed about Fitbit before.I think I was dreaming about the Surge because it's the one I've been hoping to get. If Fitbit will ever give me my rightful $130 as compensation for my broken Charge and the defective one they sent me first.If you're interested in reading that, I've put the link belowhttps://community.fitbit.com/t5/Charge/Can-I-recieve-a-Surge-as-compensation/m-p/1373579Honestly, I may be obsessive...Any comments and comments would be appreciated sincerely!
I like everything about Fitbit except the way it calculates time spent asleep. Since 10 or 20 pc is normal “awake” time during the sleep cycle this time should be part of time spent “asleep.” When a doctor or researcher recommends 8 hours of sleep, I believe they mean sleep from, say, 10 pm to 6 am. They do not mean sleep for 9.4 hours because 15 percent is going to be deducted. It’s frustrating getting numbers that make it seem like I’m sleep deficient when I’m really not. At best, if I want to discuss my sleeping habits with my doctor, I’d have to do a conversion which is inconvenient

@Alicat2104wrote:Doesn't it do that automatically?  Yes, it's subtracted from Time Asleep. Some of us subtract the awake time (again) for increased sleep efficiency sake. I shoot for 8 hours "net sleep" of light, deep and REM. Sometimes it takes 9.5 hours of Total Sleep to get that. It's really just where you want to draw the line.

Hi @ameliajoy  This might help explain the awake minutes: Why do I see awake minutes?It’s normal to see awake minutes in your sleep stages; studies have shown a typical adult could wake up briefly between 10-30 times per night. You may not remember waking up since you likely fell right back to sleep, especially if you were awake for less than 2-3 minutes at a time. If you wake up in the morning feeling like you had a restless night, you may notice more awake minutes in your sleep stages as compared to other nights. If you previously tracked sleep with Fitbit, your log included the time spent awake, restless, and asleep. We’ve fine-tuned the mechanism we use to track sleep in order to estimate your sleep stages by including heart rate and other data. As a result, we’ve combined the time you spend awake and restless into total awake minutes to give you a better sense of your sleep cycles.  You may notice more awake minutes in sleep stages than in your previous sleep data due to this change.  Note that sleep stages aren't affected by the sleep sensitivity setting on your device For further information about Fitbit Sleep Stages, please refer to this link https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htm?Highlight=time%20awake I hope this helps 😊
Interesting.  All the research has been about light at around the wavelength 465nm, which is blue, plus a little research about green light.  Blue definitely suppresses melatonin production, they're not sure about green.  UV light, as far as I know, isn't relevant.
I'm 61 female.  My HRV range according to Fitbit is 11 - 28ms typical values I see are 15.
I take around 15,000 steps a day.  I am constantly moving during the day working on some project that requires some amount of physical activity.  I do Bikram  or Power Yoga every other day.  I drink A LOT of fluids.  Eat vegetarian.  Sleep scores in the 80's.
 
My HRV seems low given what I've Googled.  I'm looking for ways to increase my HRV...but I'm already exercising, eating, drinking, sleeping as best I think I can.  What should I be exploring to improve my HRV?  (Thank you).

Stop drinking coffee or at least lower your consumption of caffinated drinks and don't drink it in the evening. Ever since I stopped drinking caffinated drinks and started eating better it only takes me a few minutes to fall asleep.
Hi @WavyDavey. I'm also experiencing loss of sleep tracking like @Long72 has. I have a Flex 2 and since the day I bought it I have been able to track my sleep, now since the latest update I can't due to no heart rate monitor. I'd like to know how I can track my sleep again using the device I purchased to do just that! I have a screenshot taken today of the Fitbit page that states I can track sleep with my Flex 2, so why is it not available anymore as it has been working fine until now? Thanks
I still cannot find the benchmarks and feel like I have looked everywhere.  Does anyone see sleep benchmarks?  Were they removed?
I have the same problem. 80-90% Higher than resting heart rate while sleeping. Rarely lower. Oxygen while sleeping low. I have lucid dreaming often and sleep paralysis sometimes. Usually around 20% tossing. It's kind of cool to see when I wake up from a bad dream and my heart rate spikes but why is it always higher while sleeping. It's not apnea... 😕
I have the opposite problem: I enter into REM stage before my eyes even close, and stay there through most of my sleep. I have narcolepsy. I can sleep and sleep and sleep, but not get the repairitive sleep that I need. I have been given a prescription for Provigil, but it was too cost prohibitive to continue using. One interesting thing I have found with using my FitBit is that while my nightly sleep sessions only yield an average of 69% efficiency, my naps actually produce an average of 90% efficiency. However, I do find it interesting that although I have fewer periods of "restlessness," AKA REM sleep, I tend to have more instances of sleep paralysis during my naps. We need a good balance of REM and NREM sleep in order to achieve healthy sleep. The goal is not to have a night of nearly all REM. Trust me, you don't want that.
Thanks, that was exactly what I was after. Pity it doesn't seem to be a feature in the iphone app.
Hi @meye3sons,Which model of fitbit? It sounds like there's two things going on. First, where did you check about the wake time? The tracker doesn't report that, so I'm guessing on the app? If you were very restless in the morning hours of sleep, the fitbit may have thought you were awake. You can go into the sleep log and manually edit the wake time if it miscalculated it.

I have similar problems and was hoping the fitbit might help me monitor and understand this better. So far set to normal I have sleep efficiency of 97% on average, so I intend to reset it to Sensitive and see if that changes.I talked to my doctor several years ago who recommended some blood tests. Test for thyroid issues or cortisol levels. But mine all came back normal.I notice I'm very congested mornings, and I'm on several allergy meds like Flonase and an antihistamine nasal spray, and often wake up with sinus pressure and low headaches (I just feel groggy, not painful so much as I just can't wake up, but recently realized they are basically sinus/tension headaches).I do some yoga mornings, take short walks, and drink coffee, before I leave for work--which doesn't solve the problem but helps me cope. I have considered getting a Phillips wake up light alarm to see if I can get up more easily. But my cat wakes me up reliably and I still want to go back to bed, so like you it's not necessarily the body's sleep schedule that's the problem.Good luck and hope you find relief.
I believe sleep score will be based  only on your long sleep session.  The only way a nap might change that would be if that might affect your sleep quality, say perhaps if you got some REM time in the nap so your body decided you didn't need as much REM at night, or maybe just the opposite, but you get the idea what I'm saying.As for detecting naps, supposedly the cutoff is at least one hour for a nap to be detected, and at least 3 hours to get sleep stages and sleep score.  If you want to get credit for nap time less than an hour, however, there is a way: tap the sleep tile, then + sign at top right, then Begin Sleep Now, then when wake up, something like "Awake now" and it will log the nap based just on your stillness, not on heart rate, and you will never get sleep stages but you would not for that short time anyway.

Fitbit suggest there are a few reasons this can happen: "WHY DON'T I SEE SLEEP STAGES TODAY?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your tracker from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your tracker higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your tracker to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your tracker’s battery is critically low."taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163
Set goals to accomplish in that window you would normally use for napping before 12:30. These could be step goals, active minute goals, or both. For me, when I need to get the activity in but can't go out because of weather, I walk/run a little circuit inside the house.  It's only about 20 steps, but its sufficient to give me enough distance to get up and go.  I also do steps inside the house as well as jumping jacks, wall squats and lunges.  Try this too. Also, I would recommend acknowledging the fact that you have developed a habit / routine around this sleep behavior.  Some of it may be emotional, but physiologically speaking, if you've been doing this for awhile, you've trained your body to expect it (possibly even crave it).  So you have to alter the habit. The way to do this is to acknowledge the trigger that drives this and change the behavior.  A fascinating book on this, one that really helped me is http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/and you can glean insights from the book via this study guide https://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/teachers_guides/9780812981605.pdf Half of your challenge is physical, the other half is mental.  You can do it!

49 to 54 is a great resting heart rate.   My RHR  is around 55 to 58 and my HRV has been stuck at 16 to 26 since I got my Fitbit 2 years ago.  There have been multiple complaints about this over the years. I’ve made peace with simply watching my HRV relative to my own range.  I think Apple’s HRV measurement is much more accurate than Fitbit.
Hello, the light can cause some irritation if you are a restless sleeperlike myself, but, I just realised right now that a sweat band worn over thetop of it may be a good idea as it annoys my husband as well.I'm very impressed with myself right now as I've been up just over 30min, a very crappy sleeper and the fog hangs very low in the mornings.😴😂😨
So here is my first nights sleep with the Flex, on my non dominant hand and set to sensitive, I have L4/L5 spinal injury and haven't felt like I have had a good nights sleep in since it occured several years ago, no wonder I wake up soo tired! My question is , how are other people finding the accuracy of results? My non dominant hand I use for mouse work on the PC so not sure if I should try it on my ankle ??Either that or in my sleep I am running a marathon 🙂 Thank for any advice

go to bed every night at around the same time and wake up the same time each morning. (even on off days)
I 100% agree. I bought my fitbit solely to track my sleep. Previously, when I know my average hours are not adding up to what I need them to be and I'm tired, It would be good to be able to see at a glance how many hours I need to catch up on and go to sleep earlier accordingly. This sleep score is just making it more complicated and it's so frustrating. Such a shame 😞 Please give us the option to go back to the average hours sleep Fitbit!
I would like to find out how to compare both modes also if thats possible. I notice in the "normal" setting, I hardly move all night and in the "sensitive setting", I have about 70 restless minutes a night.
I used to lift weights quite a bit years ago, and I hope to get back into the habit of doing so, but I do recall that when I lifted on a regular basis, my sleep would improve and I became more aware and concerned about the foods and drinks I consumed. If you commit yourself to a regular workout schedule, I think that you will begin to see everything begin to fall into place. The hardest part is making a committment and sticking with it. Once that is done, you'll begin to see a lot of benefits even though they may come in slow and small increments at first, but that is the whole point - getting the body fit and exercised and watching the benefits roll in.
It's funny that you mention that - mine has been doing the same things for the past week or so.  Was there a software update that caused this, maybe?

A friend said her FB One synchs her sleep automatically when she synchs her device. I have a Flex, but it doesn't synch automatically, I have to enter my sleep time manually for some reason.  I am putting it into sleep & wake modes correctly, I think.  Why isn't it logging my sleep automatically?

They moved the sleep percentage to Premium.  if you want to see it, you have to pay now.  We pay good money for the Fitbit and now they want more.  I loved checking on how well I slept and it is stupid to have to pay extra for the sleep percentage data, which is part of the reason I bought the Fitbit in the first place.
How do you see how many instances that you’ve woke up? I see the little red tick marks but is there a way to get more accurate count? Some of them are very thin and some are slightly thicker indicating longer time awake. It would be helpful to have actual numbers or be able to zoom in but I haven’t figured it out yet
I have been working on my sleep for a while now, and it is finally getting better.  I have to be really conscious about what I am doing, right from the beginning of the day.  It sucks, but I can only have one double shot coffee before 9 am. I don't black tea after mid day, and green tea after 3 pm.  I need to watch what I do at night.  If I am on my computer or phone within 2 hours of bedtime, I don't sleep well at all.  I can watch tv, but I need to have all the lights off in the room, just so it is fairly dark.  I take melatonin sometimes, and magnesium daily.  I think a good bed helps, and I need my bedroom completely pitch black.  Sometimes, I take valerian in the evening to feel a bit more relaxed.  I had breast cancer this last year, so shutting off my mind is the real challenge.

I don't think you understand my question. My question was why doesn't fitbit provide the time you go to bed, for example, 10:00 PM at night and the time you wake up, for example, 6:00 AM in the morning?
@olledejong   Those scores differ because two different things are being measured.  They will always be different.Here is how Fitbit calculates a sleep score:Cropped to fit.  Sleep score is 87.The link in your original post is from 2014, ancient in Fitbit years.  Fitbit didn't even have a tracker that could measure heart rate in 2014. Fitbit stopped using Sleep Efficiency when it released the Sleep Score.  Please stop trying to compare them.

Oh thank you for this.
I agree.  My husband and I both have sleep apnea and have used CPAP machines for over ten years.  He was diagnosed first and I will never forget the dramatic change in his mood and energy level after he started using his CPAP.  When I went for my sleep test, I told my doctor that I HOPED I had sleep apnea because I wanted to treat it and feel as good as my husband did!  Today there are so many options for masks that anyone can find a comfortable setup, and machines have gotten so compact that you can take them anywhere you travel.  If your doctor recommends CPAP therapy I highly recommend that you give it a try.
I don't have problems falling to sleep; I have problems staying asleep.  I wake up several times during the night 9-15 according to my fitbit. If I go to the bathroom it takes me forever to fall back to sleep.  Any suggestions?
Me too 90 my average is around 60-70 ..but I'm a really restless sleeperI've always wondered has anyone ever got a 100 sleep score....or would that mean you're in a coma!😀
It never hurts to get it checked, specially when you are concerned. Also we cannot give medical advice here. I would however not be concerned about the amount of times you woke up. It is something I never checked before. I just checked my sleep log and I wake up 30 times a night according to FitBit. Yet I do feel rested most of the time. I am not yet confident you actually wake up or if you happen to move a little more as you transition from one stage to the next or one position to another. If you do make the hours, yet you feel exhausted you can try increasing the hours (you might need more than the average person) or discuss it with a doctor.

Take a deep breath and relax.   I believe the Alta doesn't track heart rate so your sleep time will be based on movements.  If you are prone, staring at the ceiling, this may be logged as deep sleep.  If you are tossing and turning this might be picked up as restless.  I'm not actually sure if the heart rate tracker will help.  I sometimes doze or read on a Saturday morning and it will still assume I'm asleep. I move a lot in my sleep.  I found that the sensitive was making me more anxious.  Last night on normal I was in bed for 10h13m and awake 4x and restless 8x.  The awake is valid, not sure about the restless.  If I change it to sensitive the restless changes to 15x.  However when I first started on sensitive it was probably 40x.  I'm not sure if it got better because of weightloss or I just stopped stressing about it.

I can't comment on eating too little, but I can comment on a snack before bed. I couldn't imagine not having my bowl of popcorn before bed. There is actually arguments that folks who diet or watch their caloric intake, should have a little carb before bed so as not to wake up hungry during the night. If it works for you, do it. If you start to notice that your weight isn't shifting, change the snack or do it every other day. it is all trial and error... finding what works for you is part of the long term success.

Are you perhaps a very restless sleeper? I'm just wondering if your Surge doesn't think you are sleeping at all! What sensitivity setting do you have in your profile? - https://www.fitbit.com/settings/device
I’m using a charge 4
I love wearing it to bed and reading the report!   Of course,I have always had a hard time sleeping so I find the insight fascinating.
1.  Green star means you met your goal for amount of sleep. 2. As long as the line is green and below the 'High' line, that means your EOV is low (or at least not high), which is good.  When line goes above 'High', graph turns yellow, at least on Android - can't guarantee graph looks same on IOS. 3. To insert picture/screen cap, click camera icon above input box, then 'Choose Files' lets you select the location on your computer where file is located.

Don't know if this helps anyone... but the instructions from fitbit seem to be off. I just spent some time playing with mine and realized that my fitbit was not in sleep mode at night. Tapping it twice the lights go from left to right and leave some lights blinking at the end showing step progress. I tried this multiple times to try to get it into sleep mode. Every time it was the same sequence.  To get it to vibrate and show a new pattern indicating sleep mode I tapped it once, twice, three times etc. It finally worked when i just went overboard tapping it about 5 times. Same thing to get it out of sleep mode.  Will see what happes tonight. Curious to see if it logs correctly. Of course, if it does and I see how poorly i'm sleeping, I'm not sure what I'll be able to do about it. . . tricky FitBit...tricky.

Hi @shoizy The Smart Awake is available on the Versa 2 and will be available on the Charge 4 with the current update.  Please see the attached link and select Charge 4 to see the updates made https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1372/?q=updates&l=en_US&fs=Search&pn=1It is a very nice feature and I love using it 😊
How is your "Sleep Sensitivity" setting configured; "Normal" or "Sensitive"?  If the latter, try the "Normal" setting and see what you come up with.  That said, if you're already on "Normal", then I would contact your doctor and have a sleep study done. Anecdotal comments: Back in the early 2000s I was suffering more and more from poor sleep brought on by a number of health issues (starting with a badly broken leg and being non-weight-bearing for six months).  I finally checked myself into a sleep clinic in 2007 and when my results came back my Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor asked me, "Why aren't you dead?"  Yeah, my sleep was that bad. The good news was I got myself on a CPAP machine and my sleep issues were literally cured over night.
Ok so sounds like I'm right in thinking I'm a fairly restless sleeper - I usually get about 12-17% for this one. But I don't think it's a problem.
The lowest I've hit this week appears to be 46 BPM. Not too bad. I used to do a good amount of cycling and also worked out 5-6 days a week. Cycling I haven't done in nearly a year and workouts are only 1-3 if I'm luckily but my heart seems to still be pretty efficient when asleep
It has motivated me to incorporate good habits like more exercise, less junk food and etc. And I sleep better as a result, so in that sense, yes (the accountability loop).
@blue8embers here is a link to all things sleep related. this should answer your questions about how sleep is calculated. The thing isn't how long you are in bed, it is how good the quality of your sleep is. So to be awake for over an hour per night isn't really restful sleep.

@olledejong   I certainly do want to understand you.  But let me quote you to help you understand why I am giving you my responses.  "My sleep score in the mobile app for the 13th of december(sic) for instance is 84, however the "efficiency" is 90."  You are confusing sleep score and sleep efficiency. It will help if you explain why you are interested in sleep efficiency calculation.  You mention the Web API and JSON data.  Are you a software engineer?  Why are you interested in a calculation that Fitbit doesn't use anymore?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Hi @RogerPerez - You raise good points and you’ve taken the first steps ... recognizing the issue and wearing your Fitbit to bed in order to gather data. Fitbit offers a lot of good information on sleep, including the stages of sleep and how to use your device to sleep better. I manage chronic pain and sleep is so important to refresh the body and allow it to heal. I kept a journal, detailing my symptoms, their intensity and levels. Comparing this info to my Fitbit sleep info, I was able to pin point what actions helped me get a better sleep and which were detrimental to my sleep. This was important to me because the easy answer was more and different pain meds. Not what I wanted!  Here are a few tips I’ve learned along the way:Set consistent times for sleep. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same times. This allows your body to set a sleep rhythm. No electronic stimulation for 2 hours before bedtime ... no checking email, reading the news, spirited conversations in social media. TV is ok for me as long as the show is not horribly loud or violent. I found reading a book on my Kindle (which has no blue light. It looks like a paper page) relaxes me and sends a signal to my brain that it’s time to slow down. I also really, really like the Fitbit Relax feature on my device. I do it every night before bed and during the day if I am stressed. It slows my breathing and heart rate.  Finally - and surprisingly this was most effective - no eating the last couple hours before bedtime. For me, once dinner is done, I’m done eating for the day. It seems to help my body relax, allowing even my digestive system to rest.I added meds and the timing of meds into my journaling to see (from the data) when/if they were most effective. I’m happy to report this effort has had good benefits. I sleep much better, waking up refreshed and I’m off most meds. Good luck to you! Let us know how your journey to better sleep goes. It’s work but it’s worth it.

One more quick question.... While I'm sleeping, there are blocks out of my heart rate every now and then throughout the night. I have never put the Fitbit into sensitive mode, but do you know how to fix this? This was why I asked the question, but I forgot why typing it 😒
I'm a gadget person.  I'm also very analytical.  When I first started tracking sleep, I discovered that I was a restless sleeper, which explained why I do not always wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go in the mornings.  Tracking sleep also lets me be more aware of when I'm not getting enough sleep.  An example is that last night, I only got 4:43 of sleep.  Of that time, I was awake twice and restless seven times for a total of 21 minutes awake/restless.   Having this data really shows me that maybe I need to ease up on drinking so much water as those two awake times were bathroom trips.  In addition, I need to get to bed earlier and turn off the television.  Once you see it in a chart, it changes your perspective a bit.  Sort of like our step charts.  We all want solid blocks of days that are green with a star.
Timothy Bourner,I'm only seeing your question, you're probably all sorted out by now.I have a Versa 2 Fitbit  & it shows exactly the amount of sleep you get every night, plus how long you're awake  tossing & turning, amount of your sleep is light, deep & REM & what percentage of sleep score you get & whether it's poor  fair, good or excellent.  I have Premium on my Fitbit,  maybe that makes a difference or not?. I'd be very annoyed if I didn't have those sleep readings. It also gives me trends like sleeping breathing rate,  temp while sleeping  etc. Also it shows graph of sleep & awake & also a separate graph of your nights sleep both above & below your resting heart rate.If you get to see this, I hope it's helpful. Or I hope you got sorted sith your Fitbit phone.

I have the same problem and have tried everything that you have. It Tracked sleep and did my sleep score 2 nights then nothing since. Do you know how to contact customer support ? Every time I try to it says I’m not eligible for that service. I’m paying for premium too and like you wanted the sleep data!
Me too! I have crazy high RHR duing at least the first half of the night. I also suspect that deep sleep stresses my unconsciousness somehow, because after only 4 minutes I always jump right up to "awake" and stay there for some minutes. Then my body tries to get some more deep sleep, and I jump right back up again. This goes on until maybe 5.00, rendering me exhausted every single morning. In general I'm a very jumpy person, not that I can understand why though.
Mine is the same way. Will not let me open the sleep tab button.
To wake up quicker, wear long pants and a shirt to bed instead of just an over sized tee. This is because the heat is equal through out the body. Your more likely to wake up in the morning instead of stay under the "warm, cozy covers".  I've been late numerous times simply because it was too cold to get out of bed. Also do something like yoga or meditation in the morning so you look forward to waking up.
I have an Inspire and it usually records any sleep I have if it's at least an hour long. It doesn't matter if it's day or night. My watch isn't the kind to record sleep stages. Still, it does a good job recording my sleep and wake up times. Not perfect, but quite good.
I like to get up really early, so I must be sure to get to sleep early. - Take a hot bath- Read a book- Listen to Dan Jones Sleep Hypnosis Stories (This works best to stop an overactive mind)- Listen to Ajahn Brahm (Buddhist Monk) or other Dharma talks
I have the same problem and would like to know why my sleep is not tracked.    My device says, "Sleep not Tracked" ??
Have a look at "blue light effect on sleep". Here are a couple of educated articles to start:http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-sidehttp://authoritynutrition.com/block-blue-light-to-sleep-better/
How many sleep awake and restless periods indicate a quality night sleep?? If you wake several times during the night, could this indicate sleep apnea issues???
Is there a way to view details from HRV history prior to the last week?
Hey Fitbit community! Is there a way for me to get the sleep insights that I get daily through the Fitbit app. I noticed that they change daily and does help me to be aware of my erratic daily movement. I was wondering if there was a way for me to see the previous day's sleep insights and compare it with my current sleep progress.
Wonder why my fitbit is always recording 30 mins lesser when tracking my sleep. For example, I slept from 21:57 to 04:03, theorectically, it should show 6 hr 06 min. However, the tracking is showing 5 hr 33 min only. This tracking became inaccurate only last 2 weeks. Earlier, it was accurately tracked. Any idea where went wrong and how should i correct this? Regards
Thanks for this!  My doctor dismissed me when I mentioned apnea, because I'm relatively thin and active and don't fit the "profile."  I'm definitely going to push further.
Hello JollyRed That is the exact reason I bought my Fitbit, as well!  I am expecting #3 and will use the data to make him do more housechores.  We both are in science field, and know that data does not lie!
Hey there @Gafellfafuffle ! While your Flex is showing a restless sleep, it means that your body has moved from a restful postition with a little movement, such as shifting in your bed. Awake state means that there was more movement on your body than a restless state, like tossing and turning. If you have a history of sleeping issues, I'd check all possibilities to get the most of your sleeping hours.  Also, there is this thread with plenty of tips and tricks to get the best sleep every night  If you feel like this is a situation that is increasing or becoming more acute, I'd recommend to discuss this with your Physician.  Hope this helps!

I used to see my sleepscore and the saturation detail. For the past week I do not see the detail or the saturation. What could be the problem.
Fiona Smith: same here, 20 mins or so deep sleep most every night per fitbit. 64. no kids around. never feel rested. Don't drink. No caffine. Set bedtime. Relax. Have tried white noise, hypnosis videos and the like.
I appreciate seeing your screen shots @shipo . Isn’t it nice to see real evidence that it’s working?
These are my personal tips:1. Put Your mobile away before 1 hour going to med.2. Read any good book.3. Meditate a little4. Play a board game and get to bed.

I saw a post the other day and you can change the sleep Option on past data between normal/sensative by clicking on the pencil at the top right of the sleep graph on the dashboard/webpage.Sorry no help on the sleep data. Actually wondering what the "norm" for sleep is suppose to be.
Sleep is also an issue for me. Broke down and did a sleep study, guess what I'm a light sleeper! Told them that when I went in.  So looking for any new solutions. Best I've done is start using a combination of Melatonin and an antihistamine (benedryl, Zyrtec, claritin, etc) at least helps me fall asleep. Feel confident that its safe as my 5 yr old grand daughter's  ped  suggested. Doesn't help a lot with the restlessness though...
I just purchased the ionic, I thought that you can set an alarm window in the morning and it would wake you up in your lightest sleep or after the completion of a sleep cycle? It should be fairly easy to link it to the data. How comes this is not a feature? Will this come anytime soon?
6.5 hours sounds a bit more manageable. Have you (or anyone else) ever logged a week with up to or above 8-9 hours average? How was that compared to a week with too little sleep?
Well, that sort of defeats the purpose of the sleep feature. You might as well spend less money and get the zip if you feel that way...
All you missed is the beta testing. I'm sure it'll be opened up to the community once it's finalized.

Night after night good majority of my Restless periods show up as 11 minutes. Last night out of 17 periods registered 12 showed as 11 minutes. Finding that rather odd.
Thank you Andrea -
First off, a correction to the first post.  Prescribed Prozac in June 2020, not 2019.
 
My sleep scores appeared to be improving as I transitioned to Cymbalta, but this was illusory.  A week later, as the Cymbalta took hold, sleep scores cratered again.  I stopped taking the Cymbalta cold turkey on December 30, 2020.  It took a few weeks to say for sure, but sleep scores have improved since.  Now, as of Feb. 15th 2021, I got decent to good sleep scores for the last 11 nights.  Haven't seen that many in a row since before taking the Prozac almost a year ago.
 
AFAIC there was a definite link between use of Prozac/Cymbalta and lousy to non-existent fitbit sleep scores.  What I can't say for sure is whether my sleep actually sucked when taking the meds, or if the meds interfered somehow with the fitbit's ability to analyze.

@WavyDavey wrote:Hi @SteviK, There are a lot of studies on this, and they all say the same thing-- electronics at night don't help in getting to sleep. One problem, as you mentioned, is that using them tends to get the mind active, which makes it harder to fall asleep. Another issue, that many don't know about, is that electronics such as phones, TVs emit a lot of blue light. And that blue light signals the body that it's still daytime. So even if your mind is being calmed by using a phone before bed, your body isn't going to get the same "wind down" signal. If you find not having those devices nearby is difficult, you can buy glasses that block the blue light, which helps quite a bit.My cell phone has a blue light filter which automatically turns on at sundown and turns off at sunrise. I have that set up. Maybe it will help. Thanks!
I've found the same thing.  I don't want to buy the premium service!  Not fair to change things without warning. 😞
I noticed that my arm and shoulder have been bothering me a lot lately. On nights that I take my Fitbit off, it doesn't hurt as bad the next morning. So I did not put it back on this morning and my arm is still not near as sore as it was. I noticed other people reported this same issue. Has anything been or is anything being done about this? I paid a lot of money for this to not be able to use it.
Go to your device settings and make sure your tracker is still set for normal sleep.If it did cahnge you can edit your sleep tracking sensativity in the past days.
Are you actually tired when you wake?I'm naturally a short sleeper, 4/5 hours is enough to keep me full of energy throughout the day. If you're not tired and feel great, then enjoy the extra waking hours 🙂
Got it; thank you!
Thank you. I did find a few logs like this in the past as well. Is there away to set sleep only after, say 10pm?I am really surprised my heart could decline to such a low level.
@novastorm hey there- try restarting your tracker right before bed. then see if that fixes it for that night and the ones that follow. You can do that by connecting the tracker to the charging cable. Press and hold the button on your tracker for five seconds and then release the button. Once you see a smiley face and  it vibrates, you are good to go.

I do not care about my sleep score. Plz bring back sleep average.
Hi Joe7, I have found the sleep efficiency calculation to be fairly accurate.  I'm currently using two activity monitors and they are always within 5% of each other.
Hi @Rita_B - I’d like to help but need more information. Which Fitbit device do you have? Which phone or iPhone are you syncing to?Are the Fitbit app, the Fitbit device and your phone’s OS all up to date?
Hi Johnny, thanks for the answer!I am definitely looking at the right day. Everything has synced and it's the most recent one on there. It has my steps right, but says that I was asleep at the time I was on the dance floor 🙂
Hi @whyjennl,Can you post the complete breakdown of that night's score--awake, deep/rem, etc.?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Hi @Sensoriella, It sounds like there's something in your friend's sleeping pattern that causes it to report too much restless sleep. Some medication might cause an unconscious restlessness, or it could just be his movement patterns, or something else unique to him. 

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
After some research and a new app to set up my macros... Fitbit is great to track it all but I want to set specific grams per meal... measuring portions of food was too much variance in the calories I was eating for the activity I do... I wasn’t eating enough... Now I measure my macros in grams, keeping my proteins,carbs,fats balanced and enough calories... and I have more energy to do what I want,sleep much better,look less tired,and inches are shrinking 💥💥💥

I like the information on my sleep, but I want to know how to determine when would be the best time in the sleep cycle for me to wake up, in order for me to feel refreshed.  A friend of mine has a tracker and hers gives her that information.  Is there a place I can study up on sleep patterns to find the information?
Yes, it is possible. I don’t have any sleep apnea-only symptoms, but Ithink it’s possible to never notice any breathing issues at night and stillhave it? So, if I am having regular nights of 90-100% above resting shouldI go to the doctor? Most nights it’s only elevated to about 10 beats perminute on *average* over the course of the night (with spikes not exceedingabout 30 beats per minute over my resting). I do have some good nights,though. Just cannot pin down the correlation. I welcome and appreciatefeedback!!!
That's exactly the same as me. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have ALWAYS been a stress case...my REM sleep is over and my deep sleep is lower. I also wonder if this could have something to do with my "issues"? Good to know I'm not alone! Thx for posting!
What does the app say about not seeing sleep stages, click on the sleep record them click below the graph.
OK. 😞 Like 8:30- 10:30 pm is equivalent to a midday “nap”. Wish they had an option to correct it.
I'm having the same issue.  The sleep reminder continues to turn on.   I even tried to delete the app data and re-login in.
@spicynachoo I appreciate the detailed information. 
 
I was able to see that our Support Team have reached out to you, so I recommend updating your case and our team will be glad to continue assisting you.

Hi Ron, what you describe actually happens to me often except mine happens when I wake early and can't sleep. I've found that reading in bed when I wake up at 4 or 5 am helps me to relax and fall back to sleep. But sometimes my Fitbit doesn't register the fact that I'm awake. There are times when I read for an hour or more without getting sleepy again - but my Fitbit often logs this as time spent asleep. I have a low resting heart rate (58-62 bpm) so maybe that's why. But when I do fall back to sleep - and sometimes have intense dreams - my Fitbit often shows I was awake. This one is harder to understand since my resting heart rate is very consistent. I wish Fitbit would publish more details on how it tracks sleep and explain these misinterpretations. Sometimes I start doubting myself and my perception/memory of waking and sleeping times.
Thanks this is exactly the kind of analysis that i am doing too - very encouraging to find someone else! I am also colour-coding the variables to try to spot patterns.  Are you doing the colour-coding manually, or have you set it up to do it automatically? I'm doing mine manually which is time consuming, so would be interested to know if you've found a faster way.  Which element of the sleep score do you think that exercise is improving? Longer sleep, Deep sleep etc? Maybe its worth investing in the Premium to get the breakdown? So far I haven't found any obvious patterns, and so at some point will do some statistical analysis to look for correlations that may pick up things that aren't obvious to the eye, and can also subject any apparent links to more rigorous analysis. For instance, if your theory is correct, how come you didn't have a high sleep score on 3rd October? To get stronger evidence it would be good to crunch more data.  Keep up the good work!
This is such an interesting thread. I have struggled with sleep attacks since my middle teen years.  I too work as an advanced provider (NP) and have fallen asleep while scrubbed in to assist in surgery, and during more school exams than I care to remember.  Staying awake through an entire lecture was never even considered in the realm of possibility. Many years ago I started taking Nuvigil 150 mg tablets, 1/2 tab 1-2 times a day, which has basically changed my life. I still have occasional episodes, but am doing much better. I also take fluoxetine 20 mg daily which has all but eliminated my previously mild episodes of cataplexy.  I have learned to be extremely careful about the amount of carbohydrates I eat, timing of meals, and eating small meals to decrease postprandial somnolence.My sleep patterns recorded on my Fitbit Charge 2 seem inconsistent.  I haven't seen any sort of persistent pattern.Good luck with finding effective treatment.  My experience is not something I share very often, but behind the anonymity of the internet, it is nice to be able to interact with others that have similar struggles.  I hope you get some helpful answers!
Interesting.  I've been noticing that my Alta doesn't accurately calculate my sleep time as well.  I know I'm not laying flat on the bed.  My pillows do elevate me from my shoulder up; and I place my hands are under my face.
which fitbit do you have? have you encountered this problem before? try restarting your tracker before bed and see if it helps 

Elena | Pennsylvania
@chris_in_cal Your sleep score would be 90+ or so if your sleeping heart rate was better.
I'm having the same issue. I tried to deselect all days in the scheduler but the app forces at least one day to be selected. Very annoying. Thanks for the middle of the day tip; I can live with that.
I often get up during the night - a noise, dog see a raccoon or bathroom trip and the next morning I'll see that my sleep has been divided into two to four sleep times and some pretty big gaps. I discovered that if I tried to add a sleep time to fill a gap during which I know I was sleeping, it often messes up the other times. In frustration, one morning last week I deleted all my sleep times for the previous night by swipe and delete on my phone. Then, I added back the entire night -which was actually the option showing (10:20pm - 6:05am) And to my surprise, the entire night was tracked with sleep stages! It even showed the times I woke as small or large red bars. Not sure if this will work all the time but I'm gullible enough to feel tired if Fitbit says I lost sleep 🙂  Anyway I thought I'd post in case it offers a fix others might need.

@SleepyOtago Welcome to the Fitbit community. Did it stop tracking just REM or is it not showing any of your sleep stages at all?
Thank you for your reply. I have a charge HR. I figured out how to manually start the sleep tracker which seems to pretty accurate as far as the start stop times since I do it. I will however try your suggestion. Thanks again, Merry Christmas
My sleep data doesn't start tracking until 1 1/2-2 hours after I start trying to go to sleep and think I have been asleep.

Hi @_Louise_ -- Good idea AND fashionable!  I see a new business on esty in your future 🙂
Does anyone else experience this? I'm going to the doctor soon for EDS, disrupted sleep at night, nightmares and hallucinations. I doubt it's narcolepsy because don't always fall asleep in under 8 minutes. Wondering what else it could be.
@MrSleepy I would say a score of 87 is good for someone with breathing issues. Does that mean your treatment is working ?
@Tanyak12 If you have a screenshot of this phenomenon, please post it here so that we can see what you're referencing! I'm not sure about the 11-minute issue you're describing...I'd be interested to know more!

Emily | Community Moderator, FitbitAll that stepping got you exhausted? Improve Your Zzzs!
I had been getting sleep stages for the past few weeks using the sleep now button, but for the last 3 nights I have only gotten basic information because it says I got less than 3 hours sleep. My summary initially said I got seven hours of sleep, but only logs a few hours in the middle. Will just have yo keep trying and hope to get intermittent info.Wish there was a fix for this.
I got a new charge 2 for christmas and only have about 4 tiles. I can no longer see my steps sleep etc  is this because its rubbish compared to my previous flex or am I doing something wrong?
Wondering if anyone knows how I might be able to identify the date when I changed my sleep sensitivity settings to sensitive from normal.  I am assuming that the algorithm does not retroactively go back and recut all my data to reflect the new sensitive setting, and I am now trying to go back and see if I have been improving my sleep, but I need to know when I changed the setting in order to know which data is comparable and which is not.  Any help much appreciated.
I was wondering about this too. I don't think they do it by age when they give you your efficiency number though, as the above poster states. I'm pretty sure when it says 70%, they are talking about a calculation of time asleep (not stirring) versus time awake (stirring or awake). If you have premium though, I do think you can compare to others as the above poster is saying. Anyhow. I am 47, and when I use the regular mode, I get sleep efficiency in the high 90s (though not as many hours as I think I need), and I get sleep efficiency around 75-80 when I use the more sensitive mode.
Were you ever able to post an image of what your sleep chart looks like? I am going for testing soon and am just curious what yours looks like compared to mine.
Hey @WavyDavey ! Many thanks for sharing all this information with me, it was very informative. 
 
I been trying to do shorter naps or none some days and I'm sleeping better. Not enough yet but still trying. 😅

It makes me wonder how we got to deciding on 8 hours sleep as if this is the designated amount - before fitbit 'measured' our sleep, then typically it would seem that we would need to account for part of that 8 hours being in some form of wakefulness - generally for me something that I am totally unaware of.
The sleep score should be an option for peoole that want it and the data for average time slept should ALSO be an option.  Given the choice, no matter what the investment spent developing sleep scores, I bet Fit Bit will learn the average hours data is what clients find to be a more useful metric.
How would the FitBit know the difference between your sitting to read or watch a movie and sleeping? The tap method works well enough for me and my Flex. You having trouble with sleep mode?

Fitbit really needs to display this graph on the same page as the Sleep Stages graph (just below it, for example) so that we can see, at-a-glance how or heart rate correlates to the various sleep stages. Other apps like SleepAsAndroid and Beautyrest's SleepTracker do this and I find it to be very interesting and useful.
I begin my nightly ritual by cleaning the kitchen about a half hour before bed. I find it relaxing to clean and put away dishes and wash the counter tops. I also get my coffee pot ready for tomorrow morning's coffee. My coffee machine is a dual coffee maker and hot water maker so I turn on the hot water to prepare for a cup of tea. I am not a tea person but I LOVE Yogi brand tea called "Bedtime". It is so delicious and relaxing. I try to drink the tea with very little light right after cleaning the kitchen. After I've relaxed with a cup of tea I wash my face and brush my teeth. I have extremely sensitive skin so I never skip washing my face and using a night time moisturizer. I like feeling clean when I climb into bed. Unfortunatly I am in a long distance relationship at the moment and we sleep together over skype so I do have my laptop in the bed with me. I turn the screen light off though. I know I sleep better without the computer in the room and eventually I'll be able to leave it out of the bedroom.  I am super particular about the way my room is set up. I sleep the best when my bed is facing the south. I am okay with a little light in the room and I do have the shades open slightly because I love the morning light. I'm a morning person so I like having a bright room in the morning. I prefer light covered sheets and light paint in the room. I cannot sleep with clutter in my room so the only things in my bedroom are my bed and my yoga mat/blocks. I do yoga in the morning in my bedroom.  No pets allowed in my bed! I sleep terribly with pets.  I have back pain that plagues me constantly. I have an adjustable bed so I raise the foot of my bed to take off the pressure in my lower back. I also noticed that I sleep better on the sides of my bed than when I sleep in the middle. I have a queen size mattress and sleep alone. I also need a flat pillow. I try to sleep on my back (it's more beneficial to the body to sleep on your back) but I prefer sleeping on my stomach. Cannot sleep on my sides because it hurts my shoulders and back. I average a 93% sleep efficency according to Fitbit. I sleep about 7 1/2 hours a night. I usually go to bed around 9/10pm and wake up around 6am. I do not drink coffee after 2pm and I try not to eat after 8pm (hard sometimes because of work). On cup of tea before bed doesn't usually make me have to pee during the night but if I drink more than that before bed I get up only once through out the night.
I'm averaging 17 times/night. But I've been as high as 33 times/night.Is this normal?
Super interesting! I wonder if they will let you compare your data to the lab results. I was diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy about a year ago with the MSLT. I actually went in hoping I had OSA so I could just wear a cpap and hope I could stay awake all day.  Unfortunately not.  I’m 37 and also a PA and it can really be a struggle to stay awake charting, etc at work. I use my Fitbit but really am not too sure what an abnormal one would look like specific to narcolepsy. Anyways good luck and give an update 🙂
My Fitbit seems to pick and choose when it tracks my sleep score? I always get the rough estimate on hours slept, but some days it gives me a score, most days it doesn’t. I’ve tried resetting the device 3 times in a row. Changing some settings (as per other forums) but still doesn’t work. Can someone help?
thanks!

I can't upload a picture at the moment but, to me, your pattern shows clear signs of sleep apnea. I only know this because it resembles mine and I've had sleep apnea for nearly a decade now.
There isn't a sensity setting, correct? I wear it on my non dominant hand(left) which is reflected in app. I have tried it on my other wrist tosleep and had same results. The firmware prior to the sleep cycles did notshow the crazy sleep that I'm getting with this new version.
The sleep log is not accuarte. For example it shows I sleep 9 hours last night. That is when I set the timer and turned off the timer. I was up for three hours in the middle of the night, I read and even walked around. It didn't log any of that as being awake.
I typically have a 80% or above restorative sleep if I don't drink any alcohol drinks. Last night was 81% below my sleeping heart and my sleeping heart rate was 60bpm and my RHR was 64 bpm. I want to know what percentage of heart rate during sleep to be below the sleeping heart rate for a good restorative sleep? Also does this change with age coz I am 58 years old and want to relate this to my age,

Your friend has a Flex ok but WHAT do you have?There is no automactic stop/start..To manualy enter your sleep Go to Fitbit.comClick on LogClick on SleepEnter your Enter Bed / Left Bed timesSet the on the Previous / Same dayYou should be good adding the time manually does the same as if you put your tracker into sleep mode. It is either or not both. If the graph looks like your in bed or out of bed is wrong you can edit the time by clicking the pencil to the right. If you accidently put your tracker into sleep mode you can go to your Sleep Log and delete it.
I've always wanted to undergo a sleep study. How'd you go about that?

Oh wow, I didn't know that. What I usually do is just show my doctor the app.
Hello @10thousandsteps. Welcome to the community forums. 
 
Thank you for the detailed information and for the feedback provided. I'd like to let you know that all wrist-based Fitbit devices automatically detect your sleep when you wear your device to bed. I believe there hasn't been any change to the way the Sleep data is being tracked, but for more details, I recommend visiting the following link: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
On a side note, if you believe your Sleep Data is incorrect, I recommend making some adjustments like changing the Sleep sensitivity setting from Normal to Sensitive or viceversa. Take into consideration that Normal mode is appropriate when you make significant movements like rolling over, so your device records time spent awake. This setting is appropriate for most users. In sensitive mode, your device records nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake. This setting may be helpful if you wake up feeling tired even though your sleep history shows sufficient rest. 
 
I also recommend performing a restart to your Fitbit device by following the instructions here: How do I restart my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps.

Make sure you aren't drinking caffeine too late in the day. Also,if you're watching TV in bed, stop it lol. A lot of people have trouble sleeping if their mind is used to watching TV in bed. Your mind should be accustomed to going to sleep once you hit the bed.
It's been pretty consistent for about 3 weeks. Not long, I know, but as a person with sleep issues, it's made a world of differance. I've also cut back on my coffee (none after 1pm). I hope this has helped.
@trev4120 @Zil75 The alarms are stored onto the tracker, it works without needing a connection to the phone. The phone can be turned off when desired.
Charge 2, iPhone 10, both up to date Sleep data returned a day or so later but now I can’t get it to sync with my WW app also up to date. Activity does sync with WW app
@Marie_Hgl, thank you for your reply! 
 
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding! I'd like to let you know that at this time we only counts with the available options from the Fitbit App to see Sleep data or Sleep stages. There isn't actually an option that will help to translate this information into hypnograms. 
 
At night, your body cycles through different Sleep Stages. It usually moves from light sleep to deep sleep, back to light, then into REM, through sleep cycles very naturally. The information is then displayed as the image below. 
 

 
On a side note, note that there is also a Fitbit Premium Sleep information and it actually helps to analyze your Sleep schedule, Analysis of Deep and REM sleep stages, Analysis of Sleep duration, Analysis of sleeping heart rate and restlessness. For details, please click here. Other information that could help is also included here. 
 
See you around.

Hey, @eduardaB. Nice to see you around. Actually I have use it for several years but I only started improving my sleep until I committed myself to use most of the features available on my watch. You really have to commit if you want to see results, just like when you start a new training.
 
Looking forward to see you again in the near future.

For the last week I have been getting a simplified sleep.This has happened in the past for 1 day but not a week. Is there something wrong with my fitbit?It's been 8 days this has happened in a row
Last night was the first night it didn't track my sleep...not sure why either...other nights it has. Have had for 2 weeks.... I find the light on the watch waking me up so they need a OFF TIME in case you are tossing and turning.
No, I'm not alarmed or worried, as I'm very active through a day. I also have the 'reminder' setup.  It just shows the limitation of sleep tracking tech as it is now. It also shows that people of certain professions, e.g. data analysts, computer programmers and writers, probably need to check their sleep log occasionally.
Hey @DavideFitbit, I like the bedtime routine, that helps me most nights. Also limiting caffeine later in the day. Like @Matt_Saze, getting back to sleep after waking can be a challenge. Meditation does help there, but sometimes it seems I just have to wait it out.
@Jelenski wrote:HI, does Sleep Cycle app works with Fitbit Flex so I could use phone alarm to weak me up during proper sleep cycle? thank youThe sleep cycle app works independently from all Fitbit products. They do not even talk to each other.

If you eat well and exercise regularly but don’t get at least seven hours of sleep every night, you may undermine all your other efforts.
 
Sleep disorders expert Harneet Walia, MD, says it’s important to focus on getting enough sleep, something many of us lack. “First and foremost, we need to make sleep a priority,” she says. “We always recommend a good diet and exercise to everyone. Along the same lines, we need to focus on sleep as well.”
 
How much sleep do you actually need?
 
Everyone feels better after a good night’s rest. But now, thanks to a report from the National Sleep Foundation, you can aim for a targeted sleep number tailored to your age.
 
The foundation based its report on two years of research. Published in a recent issue of the foundation’s journal Sleep Health, the report updates previous sleep recommendations. It breaks them into nine age-specific categories with a range for each, which allows for individual differences:
 

Older adults, 65+ years: 7-8 hours
Adults, 26-64 years: 7-9 hours
Young adults, 18-25 years: 7-9 hours
Teenagers, 14-17 years: 8-10 hours
School-age children, 6-13 years: 9-11 hours
Preschool children, 3-5 years: 10-13 hours
Toddlers, 1-2 years: 11-14 hours
Infants, 4-11 months: 12-15 hours
Newborns, 0-3 months: 14-17 hours

Dr. Walia says there’s evidence that genetic, behavioral and environmental factors help determine how much sleep an individual needs for the best health and daily performance. But a minimum of seven hours of sleep is a step in the right direction to improve your health, she says.
 
What happens when you don’t get enough sleep?
Your doctor urges you to get enough sleep for good reason, Dr. Walia says. Shorting yourself on shut-eye has a negative impact on your health in many ways:
 
Short-term problems can include:
 

Lack of alertness: Even missing as little as 1.5 hours can have an impact, research shows.Impaired memory: Lack of sleep can affect your ability to think and to remember and process information.
Relationship stress: It can make you feel moody, and you can become more likely to have conflicts with others.
Quality of life: You may become less likely to participate in normal daily activities or to exercise.Greater likelihood for car accidents: Drowsy driving accounts for thousands of crashes, injuries and fatalities each year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

If you continue to operate without enough sleep, you may see more long-term and serious health problems. Some of the most serious potential problems associated with chronic sleep deprivation are high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure or stroke. Other potential problems include obesity, depression and lower sex drive.
 
Chronic sleep deprivation can even affect your appearance. Over time, it can lead to premature wrinkling and dark circles under the eyes. Also, research links a lack of sleep to an increase of the stress hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol can break down collagen, the protein that keeps skin smooth.
 
Make time for downtime.
 
“In our society, nowadays, people aren’t getting enough sleep. They put sleep so far down on their priority list because there are so many other things to do – family, personal and work life,” Dr. Walia says. “These are challenges, but if people understand how important adequate sleep is, it makes a huge difference.”

The prescribed 8 hours of sleep per night is the rule of thumb, but not everyone needs that much. What you describe is too much sleep. It is similar to a toddler who has slept too long and they are cranky and grumpy. If you feel great on less sleep, there is no need to force yourself to keep sleeping.

My Versa 2 was beginning to act like yours & was most irritating & annoying.  I did thf samd as you uninstsllknb app & reinstalling again, wrist band the same. I got onto the help department & they were suggesting I do what I had already done. Then they asked had I got new update & I said it says on app that update is OK. Told me to go to Fitbit App & latest update is there. I did & have no problems since then.I hope you get sorted.Best of luck.

So this is my first post on here, first of all, hello!Well, my doctor and I discussed my totally messed up sleeping pattern and she gave me some homework.Set your alarm, everyday, even on your day off, at the same time.Yes this might be really inconvenient because you can't sleep in on your days off, but she told me to suck it up and just try it.So if I have to go to school on Friday, I set my alarm at 08:00.But if I have a day off on Saturday, I still set it for 08:00, no matter what time I went to bed.Do not ask me the logic behind it because I do not know, but my friend said it might have something to do with hormones and your bio clock.
Mine is generally somewhere in around 12-16 times of restlessness. 30 sounds high to me - are you in normal mode or sensitive mode?
I've never had a chart like this and I slept well so what voted be causing it
I have Type 2 Narcolepsy and, now that there are so many new meds out, my docwants me to do the sleep lab/mslt thing again since the actual diagnosis is new since my last one. Original diagnosis was Idiopathic Hypersomnia and insurance only covers the meds that work with a N2 diagnosis.    i would love to see what the graphs of people who have N2. IH, apnea and no sleep disorders look like. anybody willing to sharr????
I just experienced this same problem two days in a row. When I got up today I also noticed my Versa was not picking up my heart rate. I took off the watch to look at the sensor, lightly rubbed it in case it was blocked. Now my heart rate is showing again. Could it be the sensor was  not operational during these last two nights? Guess I'll find out next time I sleep. Otherwise, there is something else going wrong.
Thank you for your reply.Yes I have been using the 30 day average.for sure I’m seeing positive changes whilst using Melatonin..... far more REM and Deep sleep which is what I needed based on Benchmarks. is there a way of looking at the daily statistics in Excel format? Thanks
One sleepTwo sleepsRed sleepBlue sleep  What's the cut-off between an "awake" period and a distinct sleep event? The other night I got this disaster (I have a 2-year old who needed to hang out in the kitchen, eat raspberries, and talk about animals at the zoo for nearly 2 hours... don't judge):  Which made me wonder how long I need to be awake for it to be counted as a completely separate sleep, not one sleep with a wakeful period.

Great topic @Audrey12345! 
 
I've been thinking about this recently, I just feel it's becoming harder for me to just turn off my mind, like @emili mentioned. I always go to bed thinking about many different things and sometimes can't seem to find the way to relax enough, or I even wake up in the middle of the night and immediately start thinking about the same things! 
 
Thank you for sharing all those suggestions, I find that getting a good pillow and the relaxing music are particularly effective with me. I'll definitely be trying other things to get a better sleep. 
 
It'd be great to hear from other members of the Community, to see what other people are doing to get a better sleep. 😁

I put the tracker on my other wrist again last night but I did not get thesleep stages like the night before.
It seems like my Versa is very sensitive when it comes to tracking my sleep. Has anyone had this issue?
Hi @leilow, There's no way I know of to do that easily. I have seen people take screenshots of the sleep insights to keep them.

Fitbit really has an issue with the sleep tracking. 6 month down the road and my HR-2 tracks 1-2 hours, or nothing at all for the past month and a half.
I have the Alta HR (used to have the Charge HR) which doesn't seem to bother me when I sleep, but we're all different now, aren't we?  Maybe someone you know could let you borrow theirs for a night to give it a test run?  They can easily go into their account and delete the sleep info etc.  Hope this helps...
Hi Team, i would love to see my sleep track on the display. If I don't have enough sleep I could just turn around and try some more 🙂 I do not always have my mobile with me in the bedroom but this feature is something I check first in the morning! br,scotty
Hi @robertsgj7 Welcome to the forum. Are you restless during the gaps in your sleep tracking or did you get up for a short period? You might try deleting the auto sleep tracking log and manually entering your sleep start and end time, Fitbit will then fill in the data. I've seen this work to fill in gaps. Not sure why it works, but it does. Fingers crossed it works for you too.

I've been to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with mild and occasional apnea. I do not see any breaks in my sleep patterns on my fitbit that support that diagnosis. Would it show disruptions in my sleep pattern?
I have found that eating late at night does not help your sleep - could be GERD or reflux too - just a thought - after losing 50 pounds with Fitbit my GERD has diminished - keep on moving !

I think it would be good to get it on the computer as well, since most or all of the other statistics are available on the computer dashboard. Perhaps you can send your idea by clicking on this link: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/idb-p/featuresHopefully your idea gets pushed through, or at least have an option to display the sleep schedule.

@Emamino88 That happens to me a lot! What usually helps me is singing in my head. I just sing in my head and get to relax and eventually fall asleep.
 
Another thing I do is reading. I start reading a book and suddenly I am sleeping.
 
It is worth trying!

I have a fitbit Charge 2 and July 9th I got my last sleep score for the month. Come this month I received a sleep score on Aug 1- 9th, and nothing again since. Fitbit refuses to acknowledge this is an issue. No change in sleep, or wear. I tried all the troubleshooting steps. Its almost to me as if I'm getting a 9 day trial on sleep score these 2 months, but they say that it isn't going premium. Some people have said their sleep scores came back with Fitbit premium trial a few months ago which worries me. I have yet to try the trial, and I don't really care too. Its frustrating. Just going to monitor again the rest of the month and if they come back next month and off on the same day then I will address them again, as the person on twitter just said "thanks we're always here to help!" Even though they only gave me a link for troubleshooting, and I told them that I tried that numerous times and nothing worked. Not sure if anyone has better experience with their support. There is another thread here where someone mentioned editing the sleep times, and it will show but that didn't help for me. Also helps to know how long you have had your Fitbit and when it stopped showing them. For sleep score you have to let Fitbit detect when you go to sleep, and not use the manual sleep time entries.
Thanks and amazing suggestion.. I am New member here Sahil Gogna.. i was also looking fitbit watches for my taxi melbourne company employees.
I'm sorry, but that was a copy-and-paste response about HR lowering techniques generally, and it didn't speak at all to the fact that some of us have a sleeping HR that largely stays above our RHR (only 7% last night, for example).  I've noticed this trend increasing in my case and it's impacting my sleep quality score thanks to being 10 or more points below optimal on the "Restoration" component (e.g., last night's score being 14/25 while Time Asleep was 42/50 and Deep and REM was 22/25.  I more focused response--if one is available--would be appreciated.
I currently have a Charge HR and im looking to possibly get a charge 3 for better sleep monitoring and fitness. My questions areWith my current Charge HR, how does Fitbit define restless sleep? And do the sleep stages represent any of the REM stages? OR was this Fitbit not sophisticated enough at the time to monitor REM and the other stages of sleep? The Charge 3 monitors sleep stages as REM, light and deep. Do the light and deep sleep stages represent REM 3 for deep and light as 1&2?
I'm a new user and have had my Fitbit Ionic for five days now. I'm not understanding how sleep tracking works AT ALL. For example, yesterday Fitbit has two sleep entries for the same day. 12-1 AM, and then 1 AM-7 AM, so it's showing 1 hour of sleep and then 6 hours of sleep. I want it to be a single contiguous block of 7 hours. How do I manually edit this? Also, last night, Fitbit reported 2 hours and 30 minutes of sleep when I slept a full 8 hours and I mean SLEPT.

Spryguy - I wake up with headaches almost every morning! My doctors tell me that I suffer from migraines and cluster headaches, though, and that my poor sleep isn't causing them. 😕 (They also told me not to worry about my headaches unless I start passing out). Suffice it to say, I try to better my health on my own, reading and changing my lifestyle. I think a reliance on doctors can sometimes be detrimental to health, actually (or maybe I just have very shoddy doctor experiences?) XD But yeah, every morning...pounding headaches. Sometimes I wake up and vomit. I think I have sinus problems too, because I can rarely breathe through my nose. The only drug that helped was Reactine with Psuedoephedrine, but that elevates your heart rate and you can't stay on it long term. It's sort of a chicken-and-egg problem because my rhinitis (they call it non-allergenic idiopathic rhinitis) seems to get MUCH worse if I don't get much rest (which makes me think it's akin to an immune system issue), but I can't sleep well if I can't breathe well. Also, those nasal patches don't work for me. Neither do netti pots. It is physically blocked...almost swollen. One night I even woke up with constriction in my throat (wheezing). They tested for asthma...nothing. They said my immune system is overreacting to everything, that it is not hayfever, and basically said...they don't know how to fix it. 😕 So one of my goals is to take liquid melatonin every night for the next couple weeks, totally cut out any mucoidal causing foods, do everything in my power to breathe more easily (add immune boosting supplements to my diet) and then try to get to bed before the swollen/ wheezingness starts up. Hopefully, with more sleep (and more oxygen!) the headaches will depart. The last month, I have had chronic migraines and cluster headaches, and headaches every morning, peaking in the morning actually, but generally...ever present. Ibuprofin doesn't work either, any more, and I have to be careful with NSAIDS because I have a history of ulcers and gastritis. Argh. Annoying. I feel for people who wake up in pain daily. Not fun.

Hi @Kikki5 and welcome to the Forums! I searched the Community Forums and found this answer. Hope it helps.https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Alta-HR/Alta-HR-Sleep-Stages/m-p/1944428/highlight/true#M1933===============================Hi everyone! I'm happy to help clear up some of the confusion here. I want to start by saying that anyone with a Fitbit Alta HR should see Sleep Stages, since this feature was released on March 27, 2017 for this tracker. For those of you experiencing issues seeing your Sleep Stages data, I recommend double checking the following information: For any of the nights you were expecting to see Sleep Stages, did you ever click on the "Begin Sleep Now" or "Add Sleep Log" functions within the Fitbit App? This is important to note because your Alta HR uses auto detection to track sleep stages so there's no need to try and remember to click on anything before falling asleep! Do you have at least 3 consecutive hours of sleep? This is important to note because you typically won't see sleep stages if you are waking up multiple times through out the night or taking short naps.Your Alta HR's battery isn't at a critically low level before falling asleep with it. Your Alta HR is syncing heart rate data. This is important because sleep stages uses a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. Your Fitbit App is updated to the latest version.
Hi i seem to average 5 hours deep sleep a night. but I am restless on average 11-13 times. Thats  not to say I am awake its just movement. Everyone is different. Although I am apparently in bed between 7-8 hours, deep sleep for the 5 hours I am usually more alert in the morning than I am in the evening. Have you checked your mattress, sounds odd but if you have the wrong one that can cause sleeping problems. Also, not so much and old wives tale, but a warm shower or bath before bedtime, dont watch TV in bed, better still not in the room at all. no computer, it needs to be peaceful and calming this can help. Hope you get it sorted. I have mine on sensitive. when it was on normal the first night i had 7 hours 53 mins of deep sleep and not restlessnes, didnt think that was right so changed it over.
That is besides the point.  The point is a service misleading its customers.  It wasn't the SOLE factor.  My doctor obviously took into account other factors like my personal accounts.  I was simply told, like many doctors do in these situations to keep a personal diary of my sleep, and I used Fitbit instead.  Obviously a personal "sleep diary" is going to be more inaccurate than something that is attached to your wrist tracking all your movements for the entire day, if it WORKS correctly.  He also had a Jawbone up and was familiar with the technology.  And please like, in the US you can't just walk into a doctor's office complain about feeling sad and have Prozac shoved down your throat.  I'm not acting like I'm some kind of "victim."  I am just using it as an example how these records can obviously mislead people to think there is a problem with them, when there may not be or it may not be as severe.  If my "sleep average" is shown as 4-5 hours per day, and it is inactuality 6-7 hours, that can make a HUGE difference in your perception of your health and your life as a whole, and make you think that you have a problem where there is one.  The way the data is displayed, in a graph form comparing you to others, CLEARLY implies that yes indeed there is a problem.  Why cause customer to pay $50 in order to be deceived into that type of unneeded stress?  People use these problems to FIX their issues by getting accurate information, not to WORSEN them.I really don't understand what people don't understand here.
I forgot to set my flex to sleep, and I went to bed after midnight....how do I edit for after midnight?
I second this.  So annoying
Following the recent app update my sleep has stopped recording on my Versa
I DO understand what you are saying. I use an AltaHR and a flex 2 and have the same problem when I switch trackers at the moment (didnt use to). I think it is part of the multi tracker problem there is at the moment (affecting flex 2 and alta HR among others). Once my app decides that the Alta HR was recording sleep while it was off my wrist (even though I was swimming at the time), the sleep log reverts to the old sleep pattern. It doesnt matter if I then delete the wrong sleep time, it wont revert  the stages it showed earlier.  There is nothing you can do until the problem is fixed. So hang in there, once the problem is fixed it should all work again.😀

I know how that can feel. You need to have some routine to help you prepare for bed in the evening and to tell your mind and body that it is time to rest. If you like soft music, turn on the radio for background noise. Have a soothing cup of tea, hot chocolate or warm milk.

Hi everyone! 😊
 
I have a question for you. How can meditation help with sleep? 
 
Mediation could be an easy process or practice that can be done anywhere, anytime. In fact we don't need special equipment but just a few minutes but it's very important to be able to establish a routine. 
 
In my personal experience I've been struggling to establish a routine and I wonder if you have any tips. So far, I've tried the mindfulness practice in the Fitbit App and I've chosen mindfulness goals, set reminders to complete a session too.
 
Also, I currently follow the steps below: 
 
1. I have removed any distraction from my room, this includes my phone. Then I lie down in a comfortable position.2. I've been paying attention to my breathing. Inhale for at least 10 counts, then I hold my breath for 10 counts. Exhale for 10 counts and I repeat this for a few times.3. Other thing that I keep on mind is to Inhale and tense my body. Then pause, relax, and exhale. Repeat a few times. 4. I also pay attention to my breath and body. If a body part feels tight, I try to relax it.5. Lastly, when a thought comes up, I slowly return my focus to just my breathing.
 

 
I believe Mindfulness meditation is a specific technique that tend to work well for sleep. 
 
Thank you everyone! I'm very excited to see more comments and suggestions. 😁 
 
See you around.

I have the same problem, but in quite a weird way.  I have a Fitbit Charge 2 and a couple of weeks ago I updated my Fitbit app and was really surprised and pleased to see that my sleep tracking for the previous night was now in the new style.  I had it for ONE NIGHT!  It then reverted back to the old format and has been like that ever since.  Was it an automatic trial or something?  Anyone else had this?
What's the group on Facebook? I am interested in joining - I have Narcolepsy and Cataplexy, diagnosed my junior year of HS (2010)
I can sync my sleep. Shows up on my phone, but the watch won't update. I have tried all the tricks. Restart fit bit, uncheck settings of sleep. Restart phone etc. Nothing is working. Any other suggestions.
Have Fitbit published the average hours of sleep that its users get? I am averaging 6 hours 48 minutes and would love to know how this compares with others!  What we get on the app is benchmarking of the % time in the different sleep stages for our gender and age - it would be great to also get benchmarking of the total hours of sleep for our gender and age. Ideally it would give the average and also tell you what percentile you are in.

Hi Brett. What I have done when I've woken up in the morning and stayed lying down (or forgot to tap my tracker out of sleep mode) was to go into the sleep log on my dashboard after I sync my tracker.  If you hover your mouse by the words "awake/resless" in the upper right corner, you should see an icon of a little bit of paper with a pencil on it.  Clicking on that lets you edit that sleep log entry.  Now you can change the time you actually woke up.  When your done, click the update button and you should be set.  Good luck! Karen
Bring back the daily hours slept.  The graph was always there.

I can walk the same distance on a treadmill than around the neighborhood and the treadmill will always result in more burned because of the concentrated walking. Yes, HR would be more accurate, but the Flex and other models can tell when you're "active" vs "very active" and whether your performing a more concentrated walk or run.

Just curious if this happened to anyone else who doesn’t normally get sleep stages. I seldom get sleep stages and have pretty much given up on expecting to see them on my dashboard. However, the night before my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I didn’t get much sleep and got sleep stages. Then, after I got that first dose, I got sleep stages again 7 out of the next 9 days. Before these results, the last time I got sleep stages was one night last October, and before that it was one night last June. I just got my second dose on Friday and have started getting sleep stages again (3 nights so far). I don’t expect it to last this time either, but I wondered if this happened to anyone else.

I also get these spikes occasionally but have noticed they seem to occur at the time(s) I get up to use the restroom at night. I’m guessing the action of getting out of bed and walking cause me to breathe deeper,  causing a high spike.
Article sleep tracking Other than not logging your sleep, is it syncing?

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
Yes, You probably will need a consult. You can contact a sleep lab in your area. Mot hospitals have them and there may by some a alone sleep labs in your area. I would consult you primary physician first, because some insurances require a PA (Prior authorization) from the PCP (Primary care physician) for a sleep test.
My husband complains that I can't sleep for a long time and I disturb everyone. What can you advise me?

I also use Sleep Cycle. This app is no more and no less accurate than Fitbit's sleep results. If anything, the HR function should give you more reliable results. I have a Flex, and if I compare its sleep tracking with that of Sleep Cycle I find that they are very similar as both are solely based on my movements. Sleep Cycle might pick up on some body movements, when I don't move my wrist on which I wear the Flex, that the Flex might miss, and the Flex might pick up some different data when I move my wrist without moving my body, but overall, they are almost identical.What Sleep Cycle does is link the non-movement bits and the movement bits with curves. This gives your sleep pattern the appearance of a more gradual transition between light and deep sleep and periods of awakeness. Probably in addition, it uses some algorithm to try and decide whether you're actually awake. This algorithm might be based on the duration between movements and the fact that the "normal" sleep cycle lasts about 90-110 minutes. So what the SC graphs show is based on a lot on assumptions. They often show me in the light sleep phase when I was actually wide awake and going to the loo. They always show me as waking up gradually - due to the curve -, when this is often not the case (noisy neighbors waking me up whether I'm ready or not). The Flex shows me going from being asleep to being suddenly awake - which generally corresponds more to my typical wake-up experience. 😞Fitbit doesn't use curves and only displays spikes when it detects movement. It doesn't try to read more into the data. This is actually more accurate than the Sleep Cycle curves. Although I sometimes just get "restless" when I was actually awake, it doesn't show me as being asleep.So due to the curves, which run through light and deep sleep levels, SC might look more precise or detailled, but it is not. Since it is purely based on the detected levels of movement, it cannot be more precise or detailled.With the HR function, the Charge HR should actually be able to give more reliable info on your deep, light and REM sleep than SC since your HR should be the lowest during deep sleep. You might even be able to identify REM stages, because during REM the heart rate raises again close to your resting HR, but is often more variable than that. Without HR information, trackers might easily incorrectly identify REM sleep, where the brain and other internal functions are more "awake" than during light sleep, as deep sleep because the body is practically paralyzed during REM and no movements would be tracked by the devices.Without electrodes measuring your brain waves during sleep, there is - at least not yet - no way to reliable distinguish all your sleep phases.The only thing that Fitbit does not do is to allow you to set a flexible alarm based on your light sleep. But I think a request for that feature has already been added to the suggested features list.

I have trouble sleeping too, I often wake up during the night. It's all because of my stressful job. I have tried probably all the tips on how to improve sleep. I've cut down on coffee, I go for walks in the evening, I don't eat 4 hours before bedtime. But all this did not give the desired result. I tried cbd vape cartridge indica and now I sleep better. Sometimes I forget to use vape because of too active schedule of the day. I think if I use vape regularly, my sleep will be even better.
I don't have a One, but you can buy a replacement sleep wrist band in the store link above. If you need to rig something up, you probably could use one of the mp3 arm bands.

Honestly, New Versa 3 owner first question. I have one dog that crash with me on the bed at night. Will their movements affect my sleep tracking? I'm wearing the watch and don't have snore detection. I'm thinking it will but not sure.
Welcome to the Forums, @PixieLP.

I agree with Colin, interesting findings, but the negativity makes the point less powerful.  It would seem this is a software fix that could be obtained by grassroots call for a change.

Scott | Aviano ItalyForce, One, Charge, Charge HR, Surge - iOSTake a look at the Fitbit help site for further assistance and information.
I started a premium trial, but I wasn't able to get the detailed sleep stats.  It said it failed to get them.  I had the heart rate disabled.  Does that need to be enabled for this to work?  I had premium once before and got these details, though at that time I had the heart rate enabled.  That is why I ask if this is part of the issue.
 
Or is it perhaps the device was too loose, or something similar?  It read my SPO2 just fine.
 
This is a Versa 2.
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
I've just started monitoring my sleeping heart rate and I'm finding that it is mostly always higher than my resting heart rate. My resting heart rate during the day hovers around 60bpm. I'm sleeping really poorly at the moment and have found that my heart rate seems to increase as I'm falling asleep but then gets lower towards the morning. I can't find anything that says if my sleeping heart rate should be lower than my resting heart rate - I just want to find out if this is unusual. I find that I get really hot in my sleep too when I'm normally always cold while awake.
Hi @avapuckett19I'm not quite sure I understand your question. Are you saying you go to bed at 9, and want to start going to bed earlier than that?

what frame did you get exactly! Nice Work to see and improvement!
Hi so I have a brand new charge 4, everything is working as is on it except the sleep stages. The first night I went to bed normally. I woke up to a message that said, "why did I get basic sleep details?" It then says, " We couldn't generate sleep stages for this sleep. Please try again tomorrow".It only was able to provide sleep patterns, with numbers of times awake/restless. I clicked on the link that said learn more and the next night I made the adjustments. I secured the band fairly tight and high up on my wrist and proceeded with my sleep. This morning I wake up and the same thing just basic sleep patterns. This issue is very frustrating because all support told me to do is try to turn the sensitive mode on. Well I'd like to have the normal mode on and have that work. The first solution was they just reassured me Fitbit automatically tracks sleep so, basically they said just let it do its thing. Also I can't seem to find an answer if viewing the blood oxygen graph is a premium feature that cost? Thanks
@Kevin.MWhich sensitivity do you have selected? If it is set to sensitive you could set it to normal and see if there is a difference, but from what you tell I get that the graphs reflect your experience. I think it is good if you see your physician about it to see if a sleep study can be done. When in doubt about something related to your health always see your physician, even if it is only to take the doubt away.

@AmandaGeorge Amazing tips! I love all of them, I think that I will try the first and the last one. I've been having issues getting to sleep and my doctor says that it's due to anxiety, I thought he was exaggeration until I started reading more about this topic. Where did you get those ideas? 😊
 
@alexthecat If you wake up at 3 a.m. or another time and can't fall right back asleep, it may be for several reasons. These include lighter sleep cycles, stress, or underlying health conditions. Your 3 a.m. awakenings may occur infrequently and be nothing serious, but regular nights like this could be a sign of insomnia. Work stress is inevitable, but it doesn’t have to get in the way of a good night’s sleep. You can try some of the tip we mentioned here, it might increase your ability to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the workday.
 
Have you tried to make a to-do list? The act of writing down these uncompleted tasks decreases cognitive arousal, rumination, and worry. 🤗

A friend of mine and I had a conversation about sleep the other day and he was complaining that he just wasn't getting enough sleep during the week, he asked me "what's your average sleep in a week?" and I said to him, "somewhere between 65 and 78 depending on the time of year."  My friend asked me "what the hell are you talking about?" I said "what you don't know what a sleep score is? Well I don't either but if I want more insights into my sleep score, I can simply purchase a Fitbit Premium subscription." I've never seen such a useless feature but not only is it useless it's another pathetic attempt to separate me from my money.  I can guarantee not a single Fitbit user ever asked for this "feature" and really not a great selling point for a Premium Subscription.  Why would I pay for a subscription when Fitbit is investing in features like this?  Get rid of it or keep it but give me the option to set it back to the weekly average.  Any comments in the forum that approve of the sleep score have probably been planted by the Fitbit sleep score team with hopes of keeping their jobs.  Maybe shift them to a new project like an eating score to replace calories consumed.
I do the wristband at night thing. It has two other benefits, besides blocking the screen light. One, it discourages me from checking the time on the Ionic when I wake up in the middle of the night. Two, it helps keep the tracker from snagging on anything while I roll around at night. @Zimnimakes a good point--a lot depends on which fitbit we're discussing. The Ionic I'm using now has been perfect about allowing not waking when disabling the wake-on-wrist-turn. It also has a dim screen setting that lessens the brightness.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Why don't they give us both (sleep score and average sleep?)  That's the question!  We should be able to toggle these things on/off in settings.
thank you for that.. I am still averaging 2.5 hrs sleep per night but cannot tolerate the CPAP nowadays, so just have to hope that the fitbit is accurate enough. Sometimes I see it flash during the night and then tells me that I haven't logged on.. apparently it is very sensitive to my tossing and turning.
I can understand why the FDA was hesitant to approve the Estimated oxygen variation (EOV) graph: with little guidance about what constitutes a "problem," it could/would create anxiety in a lot of people, and needlessly fill-up doctors' schedules as well as sleep labs (good for the sleep labs). If I bring it up with my doctor, I'm certain he'll take a "why not?" approach to a sleep study costing me thousands (even on forced socialized medicine). Since my EOV graph has been activated, most days show a squiggly line in the low range. However, over the past 3 weeks, I seem to get a single spike past the "high" threshold once every 2-3 nights. Is this enough of a "problem" to schedule a sleep study? Generally, what does the EOV look like for people who are eventually prescribed a CPAP machine (before and after the CPAP)? Or, have users seen some spikes, scheduled a one-night sleep study and were told that their sleep was normal? Perhaps if Fitbit won't (or cannot because of the FDA) give guidance about what a problematic EOV graph looks like, we can crowd-source where that "see a doctor" threshold really is.
I have a Fitbit I use to track my sleep but it is one of the first ones.  There are so many models out there now.  When I bought this Fitbit the main reason was to track my sleep.  I would like to know if there is a great Fitbit model you can recommend to track sleep?  I will probably use it to exercise as well too.  I use mine for tracking other things too.  But sleep tracking is very important to me.  Thank you.
Do any of the Fitbit watches track short daytime naps? I have a Fitbit Alta but it takes 3 hours of sleep to show your sleep cycles.
I will keep an eye on it for more nights and see how this develops. The heart seems ok, about 66 bpm resting rate. Where could I find the HR per hour or while sleeping?
I have severe sleep apnea and am using a bi-pap machine. I was recording very little deep sleep. I'm 68 and have recently lost a lot of weight but still very little deep sleep. Rem and light sleep has been in the benchmark for my age group. I read about taking 3 mg of melatonin a couple hrs. before going to bed. It's helped. Took a few days but I'm recording much better deep sleep. Last night I had 1 hr. and 12 min. deep sleep. That's great for me and within the benchmark. Give it a try, might help.
Hi Nora,Thank you for the great recommendation. I will look into a memory foam pillow.
I see that  my sleep stages log has many red markings.  Is this normal? There are a few red markings that have a substantial amount of time to register as an awakening  and I know I have to get up to go to the bathroom at night once or twice.  But there are others that are a simple marking with no registered time.  What do others see?  And what do others think about this?
According to the article, Fitbit One calculates sleep efficiency this way: time asleep / (total time in bed - time to fall asleep).  But that formula doesn't agree with what Fitbit reports.  Example: last night Fitbit reports a sleep efficiency of 75%.  But calculate it: I was asleep for 7:19, in bed for 10:41, and took :31 to fall asleep.  Translated to minutes thats 439, 641, and 31.  Thus, 439/(641-31) = 72%, not 75%.  I realize that's not a huge difference, but for those like myself who have terrible sleep and trying to understand why, accuracy is important.  My suspicion is this:  One considers the end your last period of sleep as the end of your time in bed, disregarding any additional time you stayed in bed, attempting to sleep, and were either awake or restless.  My last period of restlessness was 26 minutes.  If you subtract that from the numbers in the equation, it comes out as 75%.  And yet I don't know is my suspicion is correct.
My mother used to say I could sleep on a clothes line and my husband has joked about the speed at which I fall asleep for years. Today I looked at the benchmark which consistently tells me that I'm in the zero percentile for sleep latency for both men and women of all ages and body types.  Ahemmm, am I really alone in this?
I bought my Charge2 mostly to monitor sleep so I, too, don't wear it during the day.  I'm also not keen about the electrical/microwave EMF signals any device produces to the body so I wear it as little as I need to. Lately I noticed a slight reddish discoloration on my wrist at the spot where I wear my Charge2 during sleep. Can't tell if it's a rash or slight burn marks (perhaps from light sensitivity? I dunno yet) so I've been experimenting with placing my Charge2 above my ankle, fastening it loosely and holding it in place under a tight-fitting sock. As far as comparing data with it on my wrist v. leg, the jury's still out. I am a restless sleeper and think my hands and arms move a lot more than my legs, so I have been getting somewhat higher REM and DEEP stage percentages lately with Charge2 on my leg. But the sample is still quite small, so I wouldn't rely on this yet. Hopefully, others will chime in with their experiences. There is a sensitivity setting in the app you may experiment with. If you select less sensitivity your data may "improve" so to speak.
Hi @kabella66 - Here are a couple things you can try to get more info on this topic.Fitbit actually much more information than the one tip you found. I searched the Fitbit help section to find this.You can also search the Community Discussions for “better Deep and REM sleep. Our members have a lot of good tips to share. You can also ask for suggestions right here in the thread you created.Google has always been a good general tool for me. Try looking for tips there.Finally, if you are concerned, ask your doctor for tips. Bring along your Fitbit device and your phone with the sleep reports. I’ve done that with my doctors and they have appreciated it. Between them and the Fitbit sleep data, I was able to fine tune treatment for chronic pain which resulted in better, more restful sleep.Good luck.
Hi everyone! Sorry for taking a while to answer, but I wanted to be sure before I share this. I did a polysomnography test, and yes, I do have a mild case of obstructive sleep apnea. The possible reasons are either the enlarged uvula or the septum deviation, both of which I have. For this reason, I am having surgery for septum deviation next week. I've been having problems breathing because of it for very long time, so this might very well be the reason. Following that, I will have the uvula problem taken care of as well. All in all, I would suggest anyone who sees such sleep fragmentations to see a doctor and have a polysomnography test. You never know what you can find.
Mine look like this and I am wondering if I have sleep apnea as well.
I think the sleep score is wonderful !!!I've been keeping track of "how I feel" using my own scoring ie; bad - okay - good on a daily basis for about 6 months.  I have noticed my score doesn't necessarily correspond to the total number of hours I sleep and not always how much rem and deep I'm getting. I started seeing the Fitbit sleep score this past week and so far it is dead on with my own "how I feel" score.     Thank you Fitbit !! 👍👍
I knew that I needed at least six hours of sleep to feel well because five or less made for a terrible day. Thanks for posting that @wtksk8r

One is "normal tracker" the other "switch to activity record" what is the difference
I think it is a blip.  I haven't had stages since the 14th.  I changed nothing it just started show the old way.   I have tried everything to fix. Unistalled/reinstalled, hard start my blaze, have the heart rate monitor on ON, I even removed the blaze from my account and re added it, wore it snug with two fingers.   I even tried a suggestion for a quick fix.   Write down your last sleep cycle (last night) time you went to bed and when you woke up swipe to delete it and then add it back in manually, some people saw a fix where it is now showing the stages.  I tried this 3 times and it hasn't worked for me, I did however get the sleep insights back.   Good Luck
Had the same issue. First night of owning versa, it didn't log the first few hours of sleep. I restarted it and that fixed it.

I'm in LA and a friend of mine in Denver both have the same issue with our fitbit Challenge 2 in tracking our sleep. Steps, stairs, activities, exercises and the rest are tracking perfectly except for the sleep.  I've logged out and reloaded back in, disconnected from the blu tooth and reconnected but that doesn't seem to help.   Any suggestions? Thanks ~Mia
My partner suffers from random acute onset insomnia. After around 30 min in bed together they might be awake and need any sort of support from me (just being up, massages, leaving to sleep in another room, etc. - usually more than one of these). This results in a very broken sleep for me, and two days into the fitbit, very in accurate sleep metrics. I get that the tracker can only be so 'smart' and I don't expect it to confidently show Awake vs. Light sleep (but really lying in bed talking or otherwise not moving much) but is there a way to edit, or mark a day's sleep as a way of saying 'ignore this outlier'?

Today I want to talk about this topic: Sleeping Pills. Are they good and is it really the best solution for insomnia?
 
I got a friend who has insomnia and she hates to take sleeping pills, but so far is the only solution she has found effective after trying different methods to improved her sleep.
 
I had a similar episode years ago and I took pills for a few days, after a week my insomnia was gone for good, being able to sleep like a bear again. So I didn't felt the side effects of taking pills in long terms. My friend in the other hand is always drowsy and in the morning still is a bit sluggish when she is getting ready to going to work.
 
I was reading in different health articles all the side effect it may present talking specifically for health.
 
Apparently the side effects can hit women harder than a men due to the metabolism. Also other of the problems that I found is that can caused the same drowsiness that my friend has in the morning and in the worst of scenarios, may present an erratic behavior. So I wonder if this is really the solution for insomnia and why is prescribe in some cases by doctors as a solution?
 
I want to know your opinion on this matter and what would be the best practices to avoid sleeping pills.

Hello everyone!
 
Recently, I've seen a few different questions about sleep tracking. Because of this, I thought I'd create a short tutorial on how to properly track sleep, how sleep tracking may be done with each device, and what the results look like on the Dashboard. We'll also be sure to touch on manually logging sleep. Let's begin!
 
Sleep Tracking: Sleep tracking is used to help quantify the hours- and better understand the quality- of your sleep. There are a number of different ways you can track your sleep, the easiest of which being using the sleep tracking functionality on your tracker itself, if possible (please note that neither the Fitbit Zip nor the Fitbit Ultra support sleep tracking). Finally, while the majority of users fall under the 'normal' category, we also have the sensitive sleep option for the users that do not. Be sure to take a look at our article, and set your sensitivity accordingly!
 
Flex- To enter sleep mode using your Flex, try rapidly tapping your device's display for a few seconds, or until you feel a vibration and a light pattern (simultaneously). @RickyFitbit provides a step-by-step in this post!
 
Fitbit One- To enter sleep mode one the Fitbit One, simply press and hold the button on the device for about 2.5 seconds, which is when you feel a vibration and your device's display turns into a stop watch. That stopwatch represents the amount of time in bed thus far.
 
Fitbit Force- Similar to the Fitbit One, you'll be pressing and holding the physical button on the device for about 2.5 seconds, which is when you would feel the vibration and your device's display turns into a stop watch. As of a October 2014, Force tracks sleep automatically! Simply wear your device to bed- when your tracker syncs with your account, you will be able to view your sleep stats on the dashboard.
 
Fitbit Charge, Charge HR, and Surge- Similar to the Fitbit Force, you Charge will allow you to track sleep automatically.  Simply wear your device to bed! An alternative option would be to press and hold the button on the device before and after sleep, similar to Force and Fitbit One.
 
Remember, it's important to put the device into sleep mode as you're getting into bed, and take it out of sleep mode once you're waking up. After your first sync since post wake-up, you will see a sleep quality graph on your Dashboard (MAC/PS/iOS device, Android device, or Windows Phone). Here's a few examples of the same graph using different platforms:
 
 




(Website Dashboard)




 




(iOS)
(Android)
(Windows Phone)




 
 
Now that we've covered tracking sleep with your device, we can cover what happens if you forget to log your sleep!
 
Manually Sleep Tracking- This method can be used for when users forget to track their sleep at night. The process uses the following steps:
 

Go to your sleep log page.
Enter the time you went to bed on the previous day. 
Enter the time you left bed the day of.
Select 'Log Sleep'


 
Afterwards, you should be all set! Your graph will appear as it would with tracker sleep recording across all platforms. Be sure to reach out with any and all questions!
 
Important notes:

After syncing, you'll see your sleep graph with three different sleep states (asleep, restless, and awake😞      

      -Asleep: When your body is completely at rest and unmoving.
      -Restless: This state indicates that your body transitioned from a very restful position with little movement to movement, such as turning over in bed. This doesn't necessarily mean that you were fully awake or cognizant of your movements, but it may indicate that you were not getting the most restful sleep possible at that time.
      -Awake: As the name of the state implies, this would indicate that you were moving so much that restful sleep would not be possible.

We use these three states of sleep to calculate your sleep efficiency, which is the most prominently displayed number on the sleep tile/graph. To learn more about the sleep states and sleep efficiency, check out this help article regarding sleep!


Each platform is different. As such, manually logging sleep on different devices use different processes. Check out this article for iOS sleep help, this article for Android sleep help, and this article for Windows devices. 
 You may have noticed a differenced in the graphs above, particularly in the Dashboard  graph versus the mobile app. This discrepancy can be attributed to different versions of the website. 


Emerson | Community Moderator - English/EspañolI run all over SF. What's your story?
Thanks @WavyDavey - I can't find a reference on the 85% -- I'm probably way off.  I seem to recall reading that we consume more energy when asleep than when lying awake due to REM and dream activity, and may have drawn an exaggerated conclusion from that. Looking at my sleep patterns, they are pretty consistent -- it seems that my REM, awake, and deep sleep periods are about 1 hour each, light sleep is 4 hours, and I'm waking up 20 to 30 times.  My deep sleep seems to happen in the first half and REM is in the second half.  Does that sound normal or unusual to you?

If I had to do it over, I would have bought the Force also.  The flex is good but with no readout on the band itself (other than progress dots), it's only good with a smartphone app.  Otherwise, you have to be near a computer to see the steps, etc. for that day.  Even the zip has the  readout right there.   I had touble getting into sleep using the taps and I sure coudn't do it half asleep.
I completely forgot to mention. I have an appointment for a sleep consult but they are booked until April so I was looking for advice in the meantime. I definitely don't get the recommended steps, I am stuck in class 8 hours a day and even when I hit the elliptical during lunch I don't always hit 5,000. I don't seem to sleep better after days at the gym (30 min on elliptical and 30 min strength training at least), but maybe that still isn't enough. Unfortunately, I just don't realisitically have time to do more.I have been to the doctor for other tests. I am diagnosed bipolar and sleep better since I have been medicated. I used to also have trouble falling asleep and the meds helped that a lot. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a few months, I can bring it up to her. My bloodwork shows no abnormalities.
I also work the grave yard 5pm til 430. I have not slept with it yet due to the fear it would wake me. I recently bought it, so have  not mess enough with the sleep yet.
@SunsetRunner   You might not be happy with the results.  If a sleep segment is less than three hours, you don't get sleep score generated for that segment, because Fitbit generates only sleep patterns for a segment that short.  You might wind up with an awful sleep score for one segment of your sleep. If you aren't familiar with how Fitbit calculates your sleep score, you might want to check out this Help article.  Your time asleep counts for 50% of your sleep score.  The amount of time in Deep and REM sleep counts for 25%.  Your sleeping heart rate counts for 25%.  This period of awake time just might not place as big a role in your sleep score as you think it does.  There is something else you need to be aware of.  There is a sleep stage called transitional sleep, that stage between being awake and asleep.  Fitbit might register this as light sleep, even though you think you are awake. Another thing to keep in mind.  Sleep is an EEG diagnosis.  Fitbit can't measure your EEG, but uses motion, heart rate variability, and breathing rate to make this estimate. I like to keep it simple.

I had the same problem.  Bought a small velcro strap and secure it over the wristband.   Seems to work well for me.
There seems to be a known bug with sleep totals at the moment. Keep an eye on the following thread that has updates from fitbit: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/Sleep-Logs-show-0-time-asleep/td-p/2655747
I feel your pain @dave_in_ni  I actually have to get up at 5 to work out before work (otherwise no workout --- and then I'm up at 2 in the morning for at least 2 hours!!!!!)  I find that sticking to a daily early morning routine helps some (although on a good night, I'm awake for 45-60 min in the middle of the night).  I have a trick to help me get back to sleep. Since I like bowling, I lie in bed and vividly picture myself taking my ball of the ball return, putting my fingers in the holes, taking my stance and taking my approach to the lane, backswing and all. I picture the release and the ball rolling toward the pins, hooking on its way and - BAM!!! Strike! Usually I'm asleep by the time I get to my 3rd "frame." This also helps me get back to sleep. You can do this with anything - a favorite sport, or whatever you want to envision success or pleasure with as you prepare for sleep.
Please contact Fitbit Support. They can help.
Yeah, I agree with you @GisselleM. It happens the same to me. It would be very interesting knowing what makes one resting better during those short naps.

I am a light sleeper and have tried recording my sleep with both the normal and sensitive sleep setting and the results are very different, by up to 5 hours less sleep a night on the sensitive setting. Does anyone know which is the more accurate setting?
@Nunul - if possible, try taking your Magnesium in the morning or lunchtime at the very latest to see if that helps you?  That's what I do with my combined Calcium and Magnesium pill every day  🙂

Oh great, thanks WendyB! 🙂
Wonderful analogy! Well put!  I've put my one-star rating into the App Store. I took the sleep tile off my app. And now, I've taken the FitBit off my wrist entirely.  See you in the funny pages 🙂 Freedom!
It goes to sleep when you stop moving .you put the time you go to bed in the computer  . and when u wake up .then it will tell you how you slept. That works for me.you dont have to set it just have it on when your sleeping. Sent on a Sprint Samsung Galaxy S® III
This is interesting about partners disrupting sleep. My partner slept at his mothers place last night because he is helping her with some household stuff. When I checked my sleep log this morning I had considerably more deep sleep and felt more energised. I have been a bit concerned about the amount of deep sleep that I am getting it seems to range between 6% and 10% and I always feel tired, however last night when he wasn't home I got 19%.
i may have to try the dollar store idea, thanks. The other way i use the velcro wrist band is to flip it upsidedown and use it that way. It actually stays on through the night that way.

That’s is why I posted. And yes you obviously don’t have an iPhone. How did you get to that in depth chart? That is why I posted about the sleep. I wanted to know how accurate this was. You’re insight is no help at all. My app is up to date on my phone and I see nothing different when I log into the website or use my kindle fire to view the information. It is all the same. I do not put my app into sleep mode
Since the latest software release, if I go to bed at 9pm and wake up at midnight to go to the bathroom and go back to sleep - my log shows either: I slept from 9pm-midnight only OR I slept from midnight until I woke up. In other words, it loses part of the log.If I try to fix it manually by adding a sleep log, it automatically knows the times but I still have to add and it shows like I slept in two sessions.Before I had never had a problem with sleep log. I faithfully look at the sleep log since it's something important to me. Does anyone else have this problem? Is it being fixed soon?

@scrimm Great idea! There's Fitbit API which allows developers to interact with Fitbit data in their own applications, products and services. Perhaps you can share this data to Sleep IQ so they can take it into consideration. I'm sorry that your post went without a response for so long. Welcome to Fitbit Community!

Hi Esmerilda, the melatonin is a great product but benadryl will keep you from moving into REM sleep.  Many people use it for sleep but then the restlessness occurs and they often do not connect the dots. duanefn
I don't even use my fitbit at night, as it keeps me awake, but I can say that it is quite usual for people to complain about sleep disturbances when drinking alcohol. i think each is reacing differently depending on the amount, e.g. 1 glass of wine versus 1/2 bottle or 1 bottle of beer versus a six pack. so right now I am trying to drink de-caffeinated tea in the evening instead of a drink and see if that will improve my sleep
Exactly right, but that can only be done once they begin gathering data on caffeine first.
I have tried that and the benchmark doesn't change.
I move around my bed a lot at night. I am now thinking that my Fitbit just moves out of place on my wrist. After all, I'm probably too young to have sleep apnea.
Thanks for your reply.  My main interest is managing a long term non-restorative sleep issue.  Fitness and exercise is good to have.  I've looked into the fitbit charge 4 and that seems reasonable. How does it compare with the inspire 2?   I'm not interested having alexa or phone calls interrupting my life. I'm 80 yrs. young, and don't need any subscriptions or coaches.Thanks again for your reply and interest. Peter
The efficiency score is based on how many "minutes" you're awake given your overall sleep time.How does it determine awake vs. asleep?
I've owned a Fitbit ONE for YEARS, until getting a Surge in December.  I think the Surge's sleep tracking is HORRIDLY inaccurate. I live in chronic pain and some nights don't sleep at all-- but, toss, turn, moan, and groan instead. I couldn't wait see if the Surge was a more accurate tracker given its price tag. Sadly, I wanted to use it to show my doctors. NOPE. I am hooking up my old Fitbit for sleep, as it is far better at telling the truth.
@Toolman907, to whom are you responding?
Good Morning everyone, I just bought my FitBit ChargeHR. I tracked my sleep last night and my jaw dropped when I saw my sleep pattern this morning. Out of the 6.5 hours that I slept. My 'time asleep,' was 2 hr 48 min. My 'awake/restless,' time was 3 hr 34 min. This helped me answer a lot of questions like why I am always tired. I have tracked my sleep before using sleepbot and other sleep tracking apps which all had similar results. I was skeptical because they were apps that I used. Now that I have the same result with the FitBit, I am not how to have better sleep. Buy a new mattress? Move to a different apartment? workout harder? Any ideas? Thanks!S

My sleep log seems to be pretty accurate and I wear my fitbit on my non dominant hand.
Yes, as before nothing in that article applies to me, either, and now I am hearing again that things have been resolved so apparently no fix will be coming. People are often asking me what that thing is that I am wearing on my wrist. While I used to heartily recommend it, that will no longer be the case. Indeed, I will be soon looking for a better option.
I took a nap and it seemed to subtract my nap duration from last night’s sleep duration, which brought last night’s sleep below the threshold for pretty graphing. This seems like it might be a weird bug.
Hi and welcome to fitbit!No I haven't, fortunately, but I've heard it can be very painful, interrupt your sleep, and cause headaches and so on, so you have my sympathy if you're affected.Dentists can supply mouth guards to help, if need be
Shanabanana You are 100% correct. Exercise heats your body temperature up- it is normal and expected, which can then keep you awake and releases chemicals in the body and brain which stops you sleeping. Also stops you from calming down and relaxing, that’s why you have a lots of energy after exercising. Provably about 20-30 min after.
Yeah, I changed mine to sensitive, since on Normal it said I was asleep all night even when I know I was only getting around 4 hours each night.  Now that it's on sensitive, it's spot on to around 4 hours each night, but it still shows the trips to the bathroom as restless.  But it does confirm that I'm not getting enough sleep for sure!

@cstdenis Per this help article, sleep efficiency is calculated as:
 
time asleep / (total time in bed - time to fall asleep)
 
So the time it took for you to fall asleep (that first hour or so) is not included in the equation. You were "asleep" for 91% of the duration between roughly 12:45am and 6:30am, and awake or restless for 9% of that time.
@Scraw416 wrote:I'm trying to record my nap from this afternoon, but went to sleep after midnight and it not letting me have 2 sleep record for one day.    Charge 5 If I try to do what you suggested, my heart rate won't be accurate. I slept 3.5 hours and then I had a 2 hr nap this afternoon. ( Prior to now)..  First, going to sleep after midnight isn't the key.  It's what time you woke up.  Sleep is credited to the day you woke up.  Doesn't affect this case, but just for future reference. So you should get 2 separate sleep sessions for today, but the 2 hr nap would not get sleep stages with less than 3 hours sleep so you would not get restoration graph with sleeping heart rate.  I haven't run into this situation lately but I expect if you got sleep stages with sleeping heart rate from your first 3.5 hr session, that will not be affected by you later nap.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I found that when I changed my sleep tracking settings from "normal" to "sensitive" it dramatically changed what it said my sleep was like.  Possibly check the settings and see if it's set to sensitive tracking.

There was a time where I was having nightmares constantly, awful nightmares to be honest. It were getting worse every night. Until one particular night, I went to sleep as always and after a few hours, I started having nightmares again. So I woke up, but this time something was different; my body was paralyzed and I swear I was still in some sort of sleep hallucination. Imagine my reaction when I realized I wasn't able to move a muscle and at the same time I was aware I woke up. I tried to scream so anyone could help me and my mouth was sealed. The first time something like this happened to me and I was in shock. This keep happening for the following weeks and were getting worse every night, it was a horrible experience.
 
I did not know what was going on, so I get worried. I looked into the Internet and I found all crazy things about this. The most crazy explanation was that this happen due to a ghost or an evil presence is restraining you, being the reason why you can't move or scream. I'm a bit sceptical about ghosts or evil presences; so I kept looking for a reasonable explanation. Eventually I found that the causes is due to stress, or other medical reasons or disorders. At the end these episodes were scary, but I did not want to use sleep pills, so I decided to sign up in to the gym and after a nice routine of exercise, I slept like a baby so this was my solution up to day.
 
So I want to know your ideas or suggestions about this, maybe we can share best practices to sleep better and know if any of you have experienced similar episodes of sleep paralysis.

Looks very much like mine and I know for a fact that I have apnea.
I switch hands bc of my work and also bc my wrists feel clammy if I don't. I work with infants and I almost always hold a child with their head in my non dominant hand, which is where I first thought I should be wearing it. But if I go to put a baby in their crib like that it's too rough on their necks and heads and wakes them up. So I wear it on my dominant hand during the day and at night after I shower, I switch sides. But now I'm curious to see if the numbers would differ much.
I've had my inspire 2 for about a year and it also just started experiencing issues tracking sleep a few days ago. Other people have reported issues with different device models as well, so it appears to be a larger issue with something I can't speculate on. Hopefully a fix will be pushed live soon.

Are there any fitness trackers (fitbit or other) that tweak the alarm time based on your sleep stage? I normally get 4.5 or 5 hours of sleep.  I got 5 hours but woke at 3am for an early flight and felt terrible all day.  I wonder if sleep stage could have had anything to do with that. Thx for any solution suggestions,Mike
I completely agree. I just woke up to this new format and am very upset. To not be able to make this optional is a dealbreaker for me and I won’t be using this product anymore.
so on arising this morning, thinking I had another great night's sleep, I saw, after I synced, a POOR rating for my sleep  - I've never had that before!!  I noticed my sleeping heart rate was elevated considerably - and way over my normal daytime resting heart rate.  Wondering if anyone might have some feedback as to what this might mean.......or not!thanks in advance.........Jan from NH
Probably not as important asSTEPS but at first my steps and kilometers seemed accutant. Now my steps are ok but at 10,000 steps it says I have only walked 0.33km and 4000 steps later it says 0.34km. Just annoying as I walked 4km a day plus golfing etc so would like to know the correct km walked out of interest.. I have a Flex and have had it for one month.

Has anyone else been experiencing much lower benchmarks on their sleep stages since the newest Sleep Score update? I'm trying to figure out what is causing my suddenly worse sleep, according to my FitBit graphs. I've noticed my REM sleep in particular taking a giant nosedive. I used to average around 17-18% REM sleep on average. That's on the lower end of the benchmark, so I have actively been trying to work on getting better sleep and doing things to improve my sleep quality. Since around the time the update happened, I have an overall REM sleep average of 14%, and there are many nights where the amount of REM sleep I get is too low for the app to even report a percentage. Could this have something to do with the update, or has my sleep just really gotten that bad? 😞  I recently moved into a new apartment, and I thought that might be a factor as well. However, I have historically gotten amazing sleep & high REM percentage at my boyfriend's apartment. When I stayed with him 2 weeks ago, my benchmark scores were still just as abysmal. I'm wracking my brain trying to figure out what else could possibly be causing my drop in scores. I realized that my overall sleep quality, according to fitbit, seems to have declined in correlation with the new update, so I'm checking in to see if it's just me or if anyone else has experienced something similar. I already went and checked to make sure my sleep sensitivity was set to "normal" instead of "sensitive", and it was.  Thoughts? Thank you!
That's female tracking, maybe days until your period, or some such.

Hi sleepy Community members!
 
Does your sleep log look something like this?
 

 
If you think your log is inaccurate when it shows this much restlessness, you're not alone! A lot of Fitbit users have sleep logs like this, and many times it's due to the fact that Sleep settings are on "Sensitive" mode instead of "Normal" mode. A little about these two modes:
 

The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.
The sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep.

We strongly suggest that most users use the Normal setting. To change your settings to Normal, follow these steps, or visit our help article!
 

To change your setting in the Fitbit iOS app, go to Account > Advanced Settings > Sleep Sensitivity.


To change your setting in the fitbit.com dashboard, go to Settings > Devices > scroll down to Sleep Tracking.

 
I hope this helps - let me know if you have any trouble changing this setting or if you have seen a difference in the accuracy of your sleep log after switching!

@Sheilacozad   If I'm understanding your question correctly most of the modern day CPAP machines have an app for your mobile device that allow you to monitor your sleep scores.  For example I have a ResMed Air Sense 10 model which has cellular chip in it that sends my sleep data to the ResMed cloud.  After an hour or two from waking up (if using the cpap machine that night) that data shows up on my mobile phone My Air app and gives a breakdown of my sleep scores.  These scores are generally based on O2 levels, mask leaks and time of use and some other points of info depending on make and model of unit being used.   If more is needed on what model you have and what app goes with it and how to use, I would not hesitate to call your provider and ask them to go over everything to be sure you are getting all the bells and whistles and data analytics you should be getting.  As for the Fitbit devices themselves, some models provide sleep scores that break down your nights sleep and data (not related to any cpap machines) as seen above in the post from Shipo.  I hope that may help answer your question. Be well!   ~Tommy
Do i need to leave my mobile phone on at night in order for my silent alarm to work on my chargehr?
Hi,It works about 95% of the time now. There's been updates since my Op though, see my post above for more info. GL 👍
When I woke up this morning, even though I turned the tracker off I didn't see any sleep logged for last night.  Well it just synced again and I see it's been running most of the day apparently, and thinks I slept 13 hours despite running around all over the house.  Is there a way to correct what it logged to tell it I woke up at 11, not 7pm?

I too purchased for the sleep data. All I see is how many hours I slept and if I was restless. What happened to detail stats like sleep time in REM? I’m in the introductory premium phase, time to cancel?  Maybe this is just a fancy price to track steps...
Mine did too over a month ago. I only get simplified Sleep Details. Called AND emailed tech support MANY times with the same basic advice and no help what so ever! Told me there's nothing they can do even though it's less than a year old!!! Not very good customer support at all ... very disappointed!
well I my family has never seen me sleep walk or anything and even now I am my family says we never see you walking around or something at night. Which is good. since I started wearing my FitBit to sleep I have noticed that when I am turning alot I can feel my self tossing and turning. I just dont know why I cant stay asleep.
I have not got this new update on my app. I have deleted the app and re-downloaded it multiple times and there is no new feature or update available in the app store. I have a charge HR and a Samsung device. Would love some assistance.
It's nice to see new members around @Changingmylife. Well, it's very interesting to hear that you use different methods depending on your day's activities. Thoughts of beaches and mountains are really good when you're tying to sleep.  I still use CD's too, sometimes I steal one from my dad...

Mine has done the exact same thing. What did they say?
We aren't really privy to what Fitbit programmers are doing/thinking--whether it's a lack of update of a variable name or it's somehow using the old efficiency value in the new calculation. "Stupid" is somewhat subjective and reliant on assumptions.I put this kind of thing in a file called "Fitbit Secret Sauce", of proprietary information I'll likely never know. Sorry if that's unsatisfying.

I just started with a Charge 2 earlier this week, and love the sleep stages. After two days of those I now get the far-less useful sleep pattern. Checked my charge (due to replies above): still above 80%. I did track short naps for the first two days (haven't had time to nap since:() but after the first nap I still had sleep stages for next night. So are you saying that if you have sleeps under 2 hours the settings will no longer show sleep stages for longer sleeps?
Yep, mine just shows 30min of sleep in total

How much deep sleep do you get?  I keep to a sleep schedule as well.
For the last several nights my sleep tracker is not recording correctly - it says 0 mins to sleep and that I had 100% sleep; however, the graph itself seems to be tracking correctly, but the numeric details are wrong.  Please advise if anyone knows of a solution or if a problem with the sleep tracker has been announced.  Thanks!
I noticed it started happening a few of days ago.Go to the log / sleep area, click on EDIT, (like you were going to adjust the start/end time) and without changing anything click on "update".  It will re-calculate the sleep efficiency.
What worked for me is : very light dinner low in protein and as early as possible.
I’ve had my charge 2 for ten days now. Sleep stages were shown on days 1, 5, and 6. The other 7 days only show sleep pattern – no Light, REM, Deep stage info. The battery has been well charged, and I wear the watch the same way each night. Many other users seem to be reporting similar problems. I feel this feature advertised by FitBit is not really ready for prime time.
The Sleep score has 3 components:- sleep duration- Ratio of deep sleep and REM sleep over light sleep- Restoration, i.e. the average heart rate compared to your resting heart rate while sleeping So even with a few hours, if you have 2 full sleep cycle with over 25% REM and deep sleep, and sleep soundly while your heart was beating lower than your resting heart rate, you can still have a good sleep score. And inversely with 10 hours but mostly light sleep and agitated with high heart rare, a low sleep score.
I printed out my sleep chart for numerous nights as well as a summary and showed it to my sleep doctor.  Actually a pulmonary specialist that I see annually for my sleep apnea.   He has to OK the cost of my continued medical equipment CPAP machine.  He was very impressed with the color charts showing my sleep stages, percentges of deep sleep, light sleep and non sleep.  I have read a lot about sleep and knew what everything meant so he even asked how to tell other patients about using this information on fitbit.   It was very nice to keep track of my sleep/non sleep patterns.  I haven't seen him since but plan to have charts for my next visit.
I decided to return it. As it turns out, all I really like about it is the large digital display of the date and time. It wasn't comfortable to wear especially during sleep and with it not being all that accurate, what's the point? I had already been using runkeeper for walking which is much more accurate than the Fitbit Charge 2.  And I use MyFitnessPal for my diet and water intake as well as exercising. So there is no  advantage whatsoever to keeping the Fitbit. I can get a nice large digital display for a lot less than $149.
Hi @wolfie1979, Sleep stages are brand new, so currently, no. That would be a great idea to post over on the Feature Suggestion board on this site.

Just wondering if there are standards for various ages, genders, and lifestyles, that people should get some percentage-range of: REM, Light, or Deep sleep.  I tend to have mostly light sleep, with very little Deep Sleep or REM.

Thanks Matthew.  That explains it well.
My sleep log looks that way in both normal and sensitive modes.  Sometimes it indicates that I do not get to sleep until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, which is grossly inaccurate. I routinely go to bed and get to sleep around 10:30pm. However, I do have a problem with sleep-walking.
Also remember that fitbit calls movement 'awake'. You go through sleep cycles about every 90 minutes and during the time of the lighter sleep it is normal to move around a bit more. Every time you move your fitbit logs this and then you get the restless or awake data, but sometimes 'awake' is simply more movement.
Are you female? I have the same problem and the only theory I am left with after desperately trying to find answers is that it could be a hormonal imbalance. One of the reasons I say this is that I'm also always too hot at night (but not menopausal...!) and my nighttime heart rate fluctuates with my monthly cycle consistently.  It's so frustrating.....  I've tried everything to influence it... but no joy.
Hello everyone, 
 

Every aspect of health depends on a very good Sleep Routine. Fortunately, there are some foods and drinks that contain compounds that help control parts of the sleep cycle, meaning that they may help a person both fall and stay asleep.
 
Here are some of the best foods to get a Good Night's Sleep: 
 
Kiwifruit: this fruit is beneficial for sleep, this may be because the fruit contains many sleep-promoting compounds, including melatonin.
 

Walnuts: these are very high in melatonin and have a few compounds that regulate sleep. 
 

 
Lettuce: lettuce may help treat insomnia and promote a good night's sleep. 
 

 
Warm milk: milk contains some sleep-promoting compounds: tryptophan, calcium, vitamin D, and melatonin. This is actually a home remedy for sleeplessness. 
 

 
Here are some of the best foods or meals that help to regulate and improve Sleep. Of course there are more but I'll stick with these ones, nevertheless; please feel free to share which foods have helped for you! 😊
 
Hope to see your comments! 😁

thank you. it is working now. I had to download the app on my phone. would not register on windows 10 on my computer
thanks 4 the tip
my fitbit is not logging my sleep. it tracks everything else so I am not sure what is wrong
all of that is usually corrected by synching your Fitbit with the app. If you are having trouble synching you can watch this video for helpful tips.

@RCPaul712 The "time to fall asleep" is only relevant if you manually activate Sleep Mode on a tracker that doesn't offer Automatic Sleep Tracking (like the Fitbit One). For trackers that do automatically track sleep, there is no "time to fall asleep" because it doesn't know precisely when you began trying to sleep.
Yeah I'm 14 and I go to bed at about...eight thirty or nine and sometimes earilier. I wake up at the earliest 5:45 for school but my fitbit says I am restless more than half the night so I end up actually sleeping for at most six hours, even though I am in bed more than that. Maybe nine hours.I always yawn in the morning and it gets annoying. So for a 14 year old, how do you fix that? Now that high school is coming up for me in about seven months I need a firm sleep plan. Plus it takes me ages to fall asleep, not only me being "restless" according to fitbit.
I was wondering if Fitbit could market he things easier allowing us to compare our sleep patterns in the app with the average data collected from other users.The exemple would be;if you have a certain amount of activity you should be able to compare your sleep patterns with bunch of persons who do the same amount of exercise you do.
My husband found a great solution to the light problem via the fit bit.  He used an old clean sock and cut the top of it and made two wrist bands from it.  Then all ya do is slip it on before bed and viola done and done.  You could also use a simple athletic wrist band as well.  Seems to do the trick.

How many hours did you sleep.. I got a notification on from the app that says:  "Sleep insights if you  sleep less than three hours at night your tracker won't be able to record a breakdown of your sleep stages. Start getting more ZZZ's to get more insight."
So did mine. And now I am getting super low heart rate numbers. I have checked against readings on my blood pressure monitor, and Fitbit is 10-15 beats lower. Then it will jump up by 20. The whole reason I have a Fitbit is for heart rate monitoring. I can't trust the readings now. I don't know what to do. A heart rate of 50 is too low. Don't know whether to call my doc or what.
Yes, I have tried working out during the afternoon to get tired physically and also see a counsellor for my stress. It works to a point, but I am just still a bad sleeper
A few times in the past couple of weeks, I have gone to bed (and fell asleep) between 9-10:30pm, but my Fitbit hasn't started tracking me as "asleep" at all until 1-2am. I know for a fact I was sound asleep long before then, so not sure why the Fitbit isn't picking up on that? Anyone else experienced this?

I have asked fitbit to work with the developers of the app Sleep as Android, and its various add-on apps. Sleep as Android has teamed up with the developers of the Pebble watch to offer a sophisticated set of sleep management tools. I gather fitbit has declined to work with the Sleep as Android developers. My recommendation: download the Sleep as Android apps and see if you get better results for sleep management.@Vanille wrote:Which sleep sensitivity setting is recommended? Normal or sensitive?

Hey, guys. I just wanted to see what everyone's restlessness through the night tends to be. It looks like I'm restless anywhere from 10-30x in the night. Not sure what to compare it to.

I upgraded my tracker barely a year ago, to monitor sleep patterns. They took the comprehensive graphs away from us. Sounds like bait-and-switch-type salesmanship. I guess they want us to upgrade to a more expensive model in order to have what we used to have.  They've lost customers due to their deception, including me.
I have W.E.D. (formally R.L.S.) and I got the FItbit Flex to track my sleep.  I put it on sensitive mode.  I wonder though, if my husbands movements in the bed will be recorded.
I disagree that it can't be medically accurate, and you are still alive.  Perhaps you are comparing to waking SpO2 levels, but sleeping SpO2 levels are lower.  According to one medical source I just looked up:"Oxygen levels are considered abnormal when they fall below 88%."I am not saying that it is accurate, but just that 89-93 could be reasonable.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
My Fitbit Alta records sleep patterns as it has no heart monitor. I have it set on sensitive and on average it shows me as being awake/restless anywhere between roughly 2 hours 40 and 4 hours 40 (sometimes more than my actual sleep!). I always wake up feeling groggy and have assumed this is due to my restless sleep.  However, I have worn my husband’s Fitbit (with HR monitor) the last 2 nights which records sleep cycles and the results are vastly different: last nightsleep PATTERN - 5.07 asleep; 4.24 awakesleep CYCLE - 9.15 asleep (wow!); 1.05 awake previous nightsleep PATTERN - 6.11 asleep; 4.15 awake sleep CYCLE - 8.22 asleep; 1.05 awakeI’m now seriously doubting the accuracy of the sleep patterns on my Alta! Any ideas about how the sleep patterns and sleep cycles compare, and can either actually be trusted?! Thanks 😀
Got the fit bit last week... Ever since I was waking up at 5:00 am wired after having gone to bed anywhere between 11:30pm and 1:30 am. It was awful. I started to wonder if it was the fit bit. Left it off last night and slept like a rock. Don't know if that is psychological, physical or both, and don't really care, just want my sleep, so goodnight fitbit.
I agree, the Fibit is pretty accurate at detecting that you moved. So, I think of Awake/Restless as "movement".  Do you have a friend who is a bit of a night owl who could spend the night and check on you? Or set up a camera to record yourself sleeping.  Could give you something to discuss with your PCP and figure out the best type of sleep study for you.
H, I'm having the same issue with no sleep heart rate data. I have all other data relating to sleep, my battery is fully charged, I am on the latest version and I have restarted it too but still no difference. Any idea if this is an isolated problem or is this a bug that Fitbit needs to fix please? I can't seem to find an answer anywhere. Thanks
What setting do you use, regular or sensitive? And do you use dominant or non-dominant hand? Do you sleep with a partner (or animal)?Most importantly, how do you feel like you slept when you wake up? Do you feel rested, exhausted or somewhere in between?Fitbit tracks your sleep by monitoring your movements, meaning the movements of the wrist you're wearing your fitbit on. So if you roll around in your sleep, it will most likely register it as being restless or maybe even awake. It might even register it if you have a partner that moves, even if you're completely still.It's basically the same function that tracks your steps and in the same way that it's hard to accurately track steps correctly, it's hard to track sleep correctly.
The blurb about what this is and why it matters states that minor variations may be significant...
What is the range (+/-) of change that is considered as a significant variation?  Is a change from 14 to 15 significant or not?  Just a basic statement of what is a significant range change is all I am loking for.  I don't think this would detract from any enticement to sign-up for Premium.

Hi! I also get too much REM and not enough deep sleep. That's an interesting correlation, my REM sleep is at 30%  and Deep sleep at 13% currently.  I also suffered from chronic depression, though right now I am doing pretty good. I should note that I am a night shift worker (11p -730a 4x/wk) so that affects my sleep a lot, I have found that by taking a sleep supplement with melatonin, magnesium, 5-HTP, and GABA I have seen improvements to increasing my deep sleep (I was previously low as 5%). I have always used meditation, though I have kinda fallen out of habit with it lately so I am interested to see how that may improve sleep quality.I wouldn't put too much stock in strict numbers though, maybe keep a journal of how you are feeling at certain percentages and things you have done to increase sleep quality and most importantly how those changes affect your awake hours. Everyone's body and brain are different but it is cool that we have all these new gadgets to give us some data to look back on while we make changes to improve!
I am a diabetic type II since 2008 not taking Rx yet. Fighting Cancer need all the sleep I can get but it’s hard to. I sometimes have 6 Triscuits (reduced fat) with Tillamook Sharp Cheddar; just enough to cover helps me & believe it or not 1/4 cup of mixed nuts for a change up. We smoke them about 10 lbs. at a time. Will try your popcorn tip now also. Thanks
Is it tracking your heart rate OK as without this there are no sleep stages? I've had this happen on the odd night when it doesn't pick up HR for whatever reason.

you should look at your settings and make sure that your tracker sensitivity is not set to sensitive.
I just got Premium and i don’t see the benchmark graph for my age. Is there a way to turn them on?

I've been using my Fitbit Charge 5. Apparently it's the best one in terms of recording the sleep fairly accurately. What surprised me is that every night I have A LOT of "awake time"!!! Many small "awake time" and some longer ones. This is with the "normal" setting HELP IS THIS NORMAL??? Tuesday night:22x Awake, total of 1 hrs 12 mins, Many of those times were 30seconds – 1.5minutesFive times it was roughly 5 – 15minutes long Thursday Night:37x Awake, total of 1 hrs 6 minsMany of those times were 30seconds – 1.5minutesThree times it was roughly 6 – 10 minutes long  Friday Night:30x Awake, total of 1 hrs 15 minsMany of those times were 30seconds – 1.5minutesSix time it was 4-12minutes long Monday Night:27x Awake, total of 1 hrs 16 minsNine time it was 4-12minutes long IS THIS NORMAL? Do other fitbit users have similar recordings?  My net sleeping time is around 6hours +- Thanks
Hi @dan801, It's difficult to say. What's normal for one person is abnormal for another. I don't think it's one size fits all. The important thing is: How do you feel upon waking? Rested? Do you fall asleep easily, or does it take some time?Deep sleep is tied to the body's process of repair. If the amount of deep sleep is inadequate, you will feel those effects before long.

I hope this isn't unrelated to the posts here. I wanted to share a sleep tip I discovered recently that is also pretty cool. There's a sleep talking app that records your sleep talk and other noises. I found that using this makes me focus on sleeping and not fiddling with my phone or else I'll interfere with the app's recording. Let me know if this sounds like a reasonable idea to other people. I'll leave a link to a free app, like the one I'm talking about. Dream Voices app
Totally agree with this. Normal mode tells me I fall asleep within 3 minutes (not even close) and sleep like a rock. About the only time it measures me as restless is if I actually, physically get out of bed for a few minutes. Sensitive mode, on the other hand, tells me I'm asleep less than a quarter of the time I'm in bed. While this is probably closer to my actually sleep than Normal mode gets me, it's still pretty far from the truth. Maybe they could even combine the modes, and then calculate levels of restlessness, rather than just asleep, restless, or awake.
Thx Elena, again I had a bedtime snack and yet again I had a restful sleep...thx for your insightful input...it is a work in progress 😀
It puzzled me at the begining as well. Here is how to make them look different: If you take a nap, then the total time asleep will be more than the time asleep (1st chart). Same thing applies to the total time awoken, assuming you did not sleep through the nap (rare).
I just cannot understand how it works - have just this min changed to normal -- and hope to get a better understanding. I am a man of a certain age who does get up several times a night to go to the toilet. I am usually unaware of the times etc. However fitbit records them as red lines -awake- the other bits I dont understand I try to go to bed at about 11 and possibly read for about an hour. However my records show that I don't go to sleep till 2am even though I have done steps and been awake prior to that . It generaly has my wakening up time as about right but then it says I have only had 1 3/4 hour's of sleep. Am I sleep deprived?.I do admit that I do feel tired during the day but put this down to age (75)
@mawitters  You'd have to wear your FitBit in order for it to know the wake and restless parts of your sleep. I wear my Flex and it automatically logs for me after I sync. Are you putting your Flex to sleep by tapping it? Welcome to the forums.

Thanks, it's good to be here! My girlfriend and I recently got the Charge HR and Android apps. I'll have to test whether I can monitor her heart rate while she is sleeping .
I wake up a lot at night, because I have asthma, I cough a lot when I am asleep.  It typically tracks everything.  Go to your account and check the sensitivity.  There are two settings, sensitive and normal.  You may need to set it to sensitive.

My sleep changed last night to include 'stages', and as far as I can see, it's now a load of nonsense. I've been wearing a Fitbit now for just over two years, and on average throughout that time my sleep has been around 210-240 minutes a night (I'm a terrible sleeper, I know!). I think the record I've had in the past two years has been about five and a half hours, and I usually get around 50% of my time in bed recorded as being asleep. This morning when I looked at it, it has changed to stages and says I was asleep for over nine hours. I was only in bed for nine and a half hours! Complete rubbish.
Hi Thomas, The Fitbit app will show 24/7 sleep history, more info you could find here https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314and about the mattress, sure, my husband bought one from here talkaboutsleep.com/best-mattress-for-neck-pain/.

Hi @KazBlue It's a good question. Ultimately, I think it would take a doctor or sleep study to answer that definitively. But in general, you can do a few things to lower your heartrate. Like avoiding excitement before bedtime. Avoiding electronics a few hours before bed. Using blue-blocking glasses. Having a relaxing routine. When I get graphs like yours, it's usually because I'm not relaxing enough before bedtime, or sometimes have pushed a workout a little far that day, so my body can't unwind. But that's just me, your results may vary. Best of luck.

YES!  Happens to me a LOT!  I toss and turn all night.  I have crazy dreams and am really restless and feel like crap in the morning and then I load my sleep data and it says I slept 7.5 hours or something.  It's weird.
wake up with smart bulbs, cold shower and MCT oil 😉
I sleep so much better now that I am taking magnesium with my other vitamins.  My sleep was terrible with my periperal neuropathy but with extra magnesium I fall asleep quickly and stay sleeping longer with fewer awake times during the night.
I would go to a doc for sure.  Your deep sleep is low like mine. I have been going to bed much earlier to make up for all the inconsistencies on my sleep pattern. I would try setting a bedtime a stick to it if possible.  I know its hard but if your in bed longer it help boost numbers overall. My deep has gone way up since then. Also get lots of excercise too (joggin helped me bigtime).. but yeah Its worth a trip to the doc. those numbers arent great so anything to boost them would be benficial. I participate in the SleepScore beta program and it looks like SPO2 sensor has some additional insights that may help you out. Not sure when they are coming to the main app but it will be intersting to see for sure. Good luck!
@Burgandy wrote:I have difficulty sleeping so I though the FitBit would a nice way to see how bad it is.  It was defintely good for getting an understanding of when my sleeping is better or worse.  However, I stopped wearing it at night because all the sleep advice I've read recommends limiting electronics in the bedroom.  I assume if electronics nearby is bad for sleep than electronics strapped directly to the body must be worse.  I just put it on sleep mode when I lay down and sleep with it on the bed as a compromise.  It doesn't give the details of wearing it but it interferes less with sleep.Burgandy, I've read similar stories about limiting the electronics in the bedroom. What they mean is the cell phone, tablet, computer, television, or whatever else distracts and prevents rest. My Flex is part of me and is no more than a bracelet when I'm wearing it. It's not a distraction, but if it helps you to think of it as a sleep aide, then do that. You can see the number of hours you're in bed by laying the tracker next to you, but it's not picking up quite the same as if it were on your wrist. Give it a try and see what you think.

Yes, I found that when I didnt, I felt like I'd had poor sleep. The reason I started tracking my sleep, was to help with my recovery from covid pneumonia. After a spell in hospital 4 months ago, I had a very slow recovery. I'm walking regularly now, but not running yet, still to weak and tired. One thing covid affects is sleep. Prior to this illness, i'd go to bed between 1-2am and sleep till about 8am, and managed just fine. I never woke when I slept, other than occasionally if I needed the loo.These days i'm waking around 3-6 times a night, although it is improving. The fitbit is useful not just for the tracking of sleep, but night time heart rate. You can see when you were in deep sleep, and when you were restless.My average heart rate is still quite high, it hovers around 67-73, but I did have to recover from a Tachycardia caused by my illness. That, thankfully has now gone.Generally, when i'm active during the day, my heart rate is 75-95, depending on activity. When I move around, around 90-110. Walking briskly, I'm around 100-120. So getting back to more normal numbers I hope.
Thank you Janice for sharing. I am drinking 2 liters of water each day. I also drink two espressos each morning.  I have thought about quitting coffee, replacing it with green tea, or stopping altogether.  Have you tried any of these things? How did it affect your resting bpm? Also, have you encountered any good reading on the topic of resting bpm?  Thanks, Eric
YES! You actually just reminded me of one I had ages ago about there being two moons and the other planets in our solar system were so close, you could see every detail! It was like something out of a sci-fi movie. I usually forget my dreams the next day unless there is something about them that really affected me. For example, I had one about an air raid that still scares the crap out of me, and I had another about having dinner with my grandmother that passed away over 10 years ago.
Hi @momo43,It sounds like you & I have been on exactly the same journey. I’ll send you a friend request on Fitbit now & then I’ll drop you a DM. I’m considering my next steps, as I’m sure you are too.Becky.
Is this reading under normal tracking or sensitive tracking? You can switch between these two methods by clicking on the "edit" icon on the top right. If you are on sensitive tracking, and you don't think you had a good night sleep, maybe contact the tech support to see if they can figure out? I only have mine for about a month, and I think the normal tracking fit my expectation, and the sensitive tracking is a bit low for where I want to be.

You are probably getting the full 7.  When the setting is sensitive it is tracking every little thing your body does.  Even if you rollover you might be completely asleep but the tracker will say you are restless.  The only true way to know if you have sleep apnea is to do a sleep study.  I suggest you talk to your doctor and see what they say.  Just remember the fitbit is a tool, not a true medical device.
I've read how to get more deep sleep but nothing seems to work. Does anyone have tips on how to get more? The most deep sleep I've ever gotten was 1 hour and 21 minutes. I normally get 50 minuets or less a night. Can anyone recommend sleep aids, supplements, teas, ect that helped you with deep sleep.
There's been a similar problem with f.lux implying that it completely filters out blue light, by the way.  In its earlier incarnations, it really didn't.  It cut down on blue light, but that was more about reducing eyestrain caused by glare.  Then they introduced the "darkroom setting", which cut out both blue and green, leaving you with only red and black.  This is drastic enough that sites get completely changed, and I found it unusable.  I don't think that was popular.  Now they offer a feature where you can take it all the way down to 1200K, the "Ember" setting, which does appear to filter out blue light while leaving red and green in place.  This one is actually usable.  It's a special option you have to go to some trouble to unlock, though, and it's harder to access the setting.  I suspect few people have realised it's there.  Meanwhile, f.lux are continuing to enjoy their reputation for software that fully blocks blue light, even though most people using it aren't getting that feature and don't realise it.
Might be for you but not for me. I cant eat before I go to sleep. The kitchen was closed after dinner

At first I let my Fitbit Charge track my sleep but I quickly noticed just how unreliable that was so I began entering it manually. Maybe it's the way that I sleep and the fact that I always wake up at least once to use the bathroom, but entering my sleep manually is the only way I can know for sure how well or how poorly I slept. Otherwise my Fitbit sleep stats would tell me I slept far worse than I actually did.
I would suggest trying these additional items:Limit blue light exposure in the evening (for example: use blue light blocking glasses; install app to block blue light on phone)Do not consume caffeine late in the dayDo not workout too close to bedtime
I don't think 12-20 is anything to worry about I'm anywhere between 12-30. It just measures how often your arm moves. What's your sleep effeciency? mines still in the 88-94% and I'm not tired in the morning. If you feel tired all the time, can't think or concentrate then I would check with a doctor but moving your arm 12 times while sleeping doesn't seem to set off any alarms in my opinion.
I’m wondering the same thing. This has just recently started happening to me. For example, this morning at 1:42 am the target heart rate zone chart shows my heart rate at 145 bpm but my sleeping heart rate chart shows it at 78 bpm at the exact same time.
Hi @jimsimpson. The awake time is accounted for by subtracting it from the overall sleep time. So 8 hours asleep with 1 hour of awake time would be 7 hours of net sleep.

Like you, I'm a night owl. Because fitbit only counts non-restless sleep,even tho I'm in bed, it subtracts my many tosses and turns from my sleeptotal - even tho I don't wake - giving me about 4.25 hours sleep per nightaverage. This is so even when I'm in bed 7-8 hours! I seldom nap.I do feel tired, but ok...and can rise to the occasion when I need. Justdon't know if I need to be concerned with how restless I am? Another sleepwatch I have gives me credit for the restless sleep. It's amazing howdifferently the two measure. Fitbit is more detailed.Good luck!

Then you can use the stats to help your doctor help you as well. I found that I was eating certain foods that effected my sleep and that my restlessness was most always during the same time period... the great thing about the Fitbit Flex is that I have found the why to  many scenarios thanks to the tracking. Good luck to you!

My Versa shows insufficient sleep every night.  I generally go to bed around 11pm and fall right to sleep, but my Versa shows me going to sleep after 1am.  My sensitivity is set to Normal.  Is anyone else seeing similar behavior?
I have had two recent sleep studies, one in November and one 2 weeks ago. Both nights I had my Fitbit on. The SpO2 desaturations that I had in the sleep study were seen by the Fitbit. Interestingly, the first study had one minor de-sat (to 92%), while the 2nd study had 3 serious de-sats down to 86%-88%. The desats in the second study didn't look more "serious" than the minor de-sat did -- they all 4 bumped the same distance over the line into "high". So, yeah, the chart is kind of vague compared to what the PSG shows.
Hello everyone
I mean that it says I get 2-5 hours of deep sleep. I want to know if I’m actually only getting that many hours of sleep or if Fitbit is just a waste of time and completely guessing. Just last night I was in bed for 12 hours because of health issues and it says I got 5 hours of deep sleep and the rest was restless. I attached a photo I took yesterday when I posted this. This is how my Fitbit information has looked for years.
How many awakenings constitute healthy sleep? If I have between 10 and 25 awakenings during an 8 hour sleep does that mean I have a sleep disorder?
I completely agree, as a shift worker I liked the average weekly hours, if I was down at 6 hours on wednesday I knew I neeeded to catchup later on in the week.  The sleep score is completely useless if anything it could be detrimental to my health not having meaningful data.  Weekly average score '67' is absolutely meaningless, whoever thought this was a good idea needs to get a kick in the backside.
Hi All, I am new to Fitbit this is only my second day using.  I did track my sleep yesterday and it gave me a 100% on sleep efficiency.  I am a deep sleeper and sleep well but last night I do remember rolling over and waking a few times.  How accurate has the sleep tracker been for all of you?  And what is the typical percentage that you get? Thanks!Amini

That makes sense but I still think the fitbit doesnt do a good job of sensing movement when sleeping. If I put it on normal, I get almost a full night with no movement even though I remember waking up and rolling over. If I put it on sensitive, then it shows tons of movement all night. I think the Normal needs to be more sensitive and the Sensitive less.
Sensitive mode seems more accurate for me when putting my flex in sleep mode
Have you ever have difficulty breathing, even upon awakening? If yes, see your doctor asap.
Hi, can somebody explain to me if the sleep score is good does that mean I've had enough sleep. I only sleep 5 hours yet my sleep score is always good. I'm still tired though.Or is this a bad amount of sleep and the score is just measuring the stages of the sleep I did have and not taking into consideration amount of sleep.Thanks
@Kazy123.. hey there. define normal and for whom? sleep patterns are very specific to the person and what is normal for me, won't be for you. My husband can finish a sentence and three minutes later be in such a deep sleep that parade of trumpets through the house won't wake him. me, I need time to settle down and relax before I can even think of sleeping.. deep or any other

Hey folks. I've been attempting to have a consistent wake/sleep time give or take an hour.  In the past few weeks I've fallen into this weird pattern where I'll have a great 8 hours of sleep for one or two night but then for the next couple nights I'll have a lot of trouble getting to sleep and will get 4 to 6 hours. And then those couple nights of deprivation will make it that I can then easily get a couple nights of 8 hours again, and the cycle continues (sometimes it trades off night to night).I've started to wonder if this means my body may need 7 to 7.5, and that 8 hours is a bit too much and throws off my circadian rhythm. Has anyone ever encountered something like this? Any thoughts? It's not a huge problem but I'd like the situation to improve nonetheless. Thanks!
@tkcornbred Can you please take a screenshot of what you're seeing and share it here with me so I can see what you're seeing. Also, provide me with the exact date of this sleep period. Thanks in advance!

It’s a bit low and may indicate apnea…an oximeter used during the night and Not the day may be worth investing in. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist who will send you home with one too.
i had to swipe from the edge to get past that bar table ... The data is below it
I'm 65 year old man. I noticed since I started using my Fitbit my resting/sleeping hear rate gets to 42.I do play tennis but I'm not a runner. I lost my left lung to cancer 23 years ago.  I'm concerned about a 42 bpm should I be?Thank you in advance to anyone who reply's
Hello folks, I've just got my FitBit Alta HR.Does anyone know if FitBit starts an alarm just at the time set or this time may vary depending on your current sleep phase? It is better to be awaken at Light and higher phase. Thanks in advance!
When I wake up I remove the Fitbit while I take a shower and use the bathroom... this time is being added to my sleep time and therefore gives an innacurate sleep time metric as a result.  The tracker should be able to detect the removal of the band at the end of a sleep period or there should be a way of stopping sleep monitoring before the Fitbit band is removed.

@Calathea77Thanks for the heads up re: Sleepmeter. I created my own tracker a while back which uses Excel's standard deviation calcs to alert me when a night's results are way off from my averages.
It is the idea that the blue light from screens has a bad effect on sleep.  Audiobooks and listening to a story on a blank-screen TV should be fine.  I love audiobooks, they keep me company when I can#t sleep.

to add more sleep records you can just go to the log in the fitbit dashboard and then go to sleep, at almost the top of the page should be an option that says something like "add new sleep record" and then two blanks so that you can add the start and end time, if you dont add a new log during a time that your fitbit already thinks that you were asleep then it will accept the new record.
Hello @jezward It's great to see you around! 
 
Thank you very much for the information! Currently, it is not possible to combine two or more sleep logs into one. But, there is a workaround for this which is manually editing your sleep, but I believe this is what you've been doing so far. For more information, please check:

This is pretty common for me: Sun: 1 hr 50 minMon: 0 minTues: 31 minWed: 1 hr 50 minThurs: 1 hr 19 min  Granted, I work 3PM-12 AM Sunday-Thursday. I generally get up between 8:00AM-10:00AM. 4 days a week, I have to drive 45 minutes each way to work, and I get to work from home on thursday. I'm running on fumes most days and I seem to manage to function for the most part. Once and a while, I'll get a good night's sleep and the sleep bar looks all fancy and curly, but most of the time it's just blue blocks with red lines and a few gaps where I was actually asleep. I probably do move a lot in my sleep, but I manage to have dreams that I remember, so I'm beginning to question the accuracy of this device to adequately measure my sleep.Anyone else relate?

Opened Fitbit this morning to see how my sleep had been (trying a new herbal sleep "enhancer"), and it asked me to log in ( a new development), rejected my password , when I got on it asked something about my sleep tracker, and showed a completely different dashboard, with no tile for sleep.  In settings sleep tracking was turned on.  Is this a botched roll-out of a new web interface?
Numerous studies have shown that REM may help to prevent Dementia and Alzheimer's. If REM periods are short your could be at higher risk of developing either of the two conditions.  REM disorder has also been linked with the onset of Alzheimer's.  For example:In 6 hours sleep I get average 30% "2 hours" of REM sleep In 9 hours of sleep I get average 30% "3 hours" of REM sleepI've had my FitBit Charge 3 for 5 weeks now and it's showing consistently that 30% of the sleep I get is REM regardless of the total amount of time slept.   Article from 2014: https://www.alzheimers.net/rem-sleep-disorder-and-alzheimers/Article from 2017: https://www.livescience.com/60216-decreased-rem-sleep-dementia-risk.htmlArticle from 2017: https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/lack-rem-sleep-linked-increased-risk-dementia/
Hi! I know the recommended amount of sleep is 8 hours but I don't get how anyone with normal working hours could ever get that much sleep.  Since I've been using Fitbit I know that I'm actually awake for about 1 hour every night during 'sleep'. I like to get up at 06:00. So if I want 8 hours of solid sleep I need to spend NINE HOURS in bed... I'm lucky if I get 6 hours (so 7h in bed).I don't just have to get to bed at 22:00. No, I need to start sleeping at 21:00... Which implies I need to start getting ready for bed at 20:30. This can't be normal. I get home from work at 17:00. That means I barely get any time to eat and to do anything fun. If that's really true than count me out 😛 So my possible answers to this predicament are: A) 8 hours of sleep is ridiculous and over the top  B) This recommendation of 8h of sleep was invented before sleep trackers could tell you you're actually awake for 1h every night. So it's actually 7 hours. C) It really is 8h of solid sleep and I'm slowly destroying my body by never getting that amount of sleep

Where can I find out which of the 3 areas affected my "sleep score"? I am sure that some nights it's lower due to duration, but other nights when the duration seems appropriate, I'd like to be able to see if it's the Quality or the Restoration that is lacking. But I can't figure out where to view that? Thanks.
Hi.This is mine just yesterday night. How scary is it? Went to a heartspecialist. Did Ct Scan, Echo, Ecg and doc said that i don't have any majorarteries blockages but the branch of one of my major artery is 70% blocked.I don't know whether it is causing this issue or not. Doc said best to goto his sleep clinic and find out more. What is that flat line anyways? I AmWorried too..
I have a Charge 3. My sleep reports consistently show that I was just asleep - not awake and then fell asleep (I think that has recorded only 1 time). Plus, it doesn't record the correct time I fell asleep - sometimes it is off by as much as 5 hours.  I restarted the tracker, uninstalled/reinstalled the app., updated the app, switched to sensitive (no improvement) and then back to normal, changed from my non-dominant arm to my dominant arm (no improvement).  Since none of those things worked, I traded trackers with a friend and my tracker recorded her sleep correctly - her tracker did the same thing to me that mine does - suddenly sleeping and the time I fell asleep is incorrect. Also tried wearing the tracker tighter and looser on my arm - no improvement.  Any idea why my charge 3 won't pick up on my sleep time?
My Fitbit tells me that most nights I only get about 20 minutes of deep sleep!!
I take this exact same pill every time I have a hard time sleeping.
Thanks, Amanda. As you advised, I stop using any technology about 30 minutes before I go to bed. Instead, I read a book. It's been a couple of years not to read, so I am not sure which reading or not using technology helps me... 🙂 This helps me a lot! Recently, it takes about 5-10 mins to fall asleep.
There has been a study or two on "sleep insomnia" - where you fall asleep easily, but wake up after 3-4 hours. The study suggested that this was a normal pattern for our ancestors - checking on the fire, security type stuff. How they reached this conclusion is anyone's guess. When I find the link, I'll share it.  I have been struggling with sleep for...the past two years, really. I think it's when I went from working in a kitchen to sitting behind a desk. Before, I could look at my job and although I'd be broke all the time (still enough to pay the bills), I always had energy and slept like a baby. Which was good, because my job required that. Now, I wake up after 4 hours, wide awake. So, I just get up and exercise and start my day. Going back to bed after an hour is ridiculous, as I'd have to get up in another couple of hours. I did that once and woke up exhausted.  Part of me feels like the inactive day is having more of an impact on my than I think, but the other part says it's all in my head. And yet, a third part says both parts are right. A fourth part says I have too many personalities. (I am kidding - I do not need a straight jacket!)  The weird thing is that it's not my bladder waking me up. If it were, I promise, I'd just wet the bed to sleep more than 4 hours! I'm kidding again!  I've tried going to bed later, to time my awakening to the last possible moment - and even on weekends, I get up 4 hours after I go to bed. If I go to bed at 9pm, I'll get up at 1am. If I go to bed at midnight, I'll get up at 4am.  I function okay during the day - but after lunch, I am yawning all the time. Drives me insane.

I, too have found that the fitbit was messing with my sleep. Unfortunately, it took months to figure it out, since some other things were going on at the same time, so I didn't attribute the problem was the fitbit. I was waking up every morning thinking every devil in hell was inside me. Of course I didn't think it could be the fitbit. I tried everything to feel better. I finally took it off and now feel so much better! I know a lot of people aren't affected by it, but there are some, and I am one of them.
I agree.  Beer and other alcoholic bevs. seem to have the same affect.  Guess I have to have my wine by 5 p.m!

This is pretty late but yes falling asleep very quickly (under 5 minutes) is usually a sign of sleep deprivation. https://www.verywellhealth.com/could-falling-asleep-too-fast-be-a-sleep-problem-3015146
Me too! Has anyone seen a fix to this open button issue?
I am in the same boat. I have the charge 2 for  a few days. When I go to sleep and even if I toss and turn for 30-40 minutes it still registers this as light sleep. Same thing when i wake up in the morning: I am fully alert but not moving too much and it still registers this as light sleep. This makes me less confident for the results I get the rest of the night.
While sleeping, HR's tend to dip low. especially for athletes (even low resting HR). Some people tend to focus on their numbers but are totally asymptomatic. As long as you feel good, and are in generally good health no need to worry.How do you like your fitbit charge?
For some reason even on days and weeks when I sleep really well fitbit always reports that I only slept for 6-7 hours. Recently I was on vacation for a month and was sleeping the whole time and it just recorded 8 hours of sleep 5 times?
I                                   I'm sure you'll see a big improvement on the normal setting.  If you've never had a sleep study I guarantee you will not sleep much when you're hooked up to all the wires.  It's an interesting process.....I've had 3 of them. If you don't mind sharing how you make out, I'd love to hear.  Sometimes it takes a month to get the results.
I am in my 50's. I get loads of light sleep - well above average but very little REM sleep - down to 12-15% most nights. My deep sleep seems to be normal. I find it hard to sleep more than 5-6 hours per night. However, I find if I allow myself to sleep in on weekends my REM goes up. I prefer to sleep in the day than in the night and feel much better if I go to bed late and wake up late. Also I rarely start a REM cycle until I have been asleep at least 3-4 hours...
I also had a nightmares a few days ago. But I solved this problem successfuly. Try to read this: https://sleepmentor.net/how-to-get-rid-of-bad-dreams/

I had a hard time sleeping last night. Went to bed around 11 and was still awake at 12:44 last check. When I checked the sleep log, it had sleep starting at 10:44, so I edited it manually to 12:44 and then it gave me some odd results. 793 minutes awake/restless 596 minutes to fall asleep 47 times awake 62 times restless. That's obviously not accurate it must think I was trying to sleep since I woke up yesterday morning. Anyway I was taking mirtazapine, melatonin, and some electrolytes, (potassium,and magnesium) before bed and it wasn't particularly helpful. I had some tea around seven which must've kept me up.

I had similar symptoms (could "sleep" for HOURS, but still be horribly fatigued the next day). Went to the doc, who sent me to a sleep study. Turned out, though I was "sleeping". I was never entering REM. as soon as I'd start to go into REM, I'd "wake", just not consciously. I'm a night shifter. It was explained to me' because my schedule is so wonky, my body/mind no longer understands when it's supposed to be awake or when it's supposed to be sleeping. I'd make an appointment with the doc if I were you; might be more going on there.
My charge 3 doesn't seem to track my naps.. and well, when I do wake up in morning and I go up for 15-30 min and going back to sleep, it tracks it but it puts it into new section that doesn't show up in dashboard somehow.And yesterday I'd a 2 hour nap in evening 5-7pm, and it didn't show up at all as anything.
Today i got a sleep score of 91. i went to bed last night at 0:55 and woke up at 12:26 so i basically slept 10 hours and 19 minutes. if i would have slept an hour more i probably would have gotten a 100 sleep score
Hi @hawkmeister, let me give you a warm welcome to our Community!
 
Well, your overall Sleep score is a sum of your individual scores in sleep duration, sleep quality, and restoration, for a total score of up to 100. Most people get a score between 72 and 83. Sleep score ranges are:
 

Excellent: 90-100
Good: 80-89
Fair: 60-79
Poor: Less than 60

Hope this helps!

Same for me. I wake constantly through the night and got a fitbit around 10 days ago (Xmas). First night with it on had an appaling night, I know I was awake for hours but it said I'd had 9.5 hours' sleep! Yeah right. So I put it on high sensitive and it's now telling me as little as 2 hrs 55min (last night). I know I'm somwhere in between (although closer to to the lower figure sadly). The settings seem to be two extremes, but on high sensitive it only reports me as 'awake' if I actually get out of bed (for a wee!) I think it someone needs to do some tweaking!
My Versa 2 stopped recording a sleep score last Sunday Jan 26th. Prior to that it worked consistently going back to when I bought it at the beginning of December 2019. I read in some other related forums that turning off then on Heart Rate Tracking in Settings, with a shutdown and restart between resolved it for others. I just went through it. I'll know in the morning if it fixed my Versa 2.
Thanx for your responses. I'll investigate the SpO2 sensor & HR alarm.
Hi, The new sleep stages is terrible.  The old version was nice because when you saw fewer lines you felt great about your sleep.  Now you can't tell if you've slept well or not.  All of the colours are distracting.  Can you please at least offer the old format on top of the new. Thanks.

Its common to have periods of awakening. Most are too short to remember anything. I go by net sleep, sleep time minus awake time. So to get 8 hours sleep, I'll sleep almost 9. That's what I go by.

That's great. What I'm telling you, though, is you can't get "sleep quality" and "sleep stages" both--they are totally different things in the world of Fitbit. You have to choose, and the choice will greatly help you decide which model to get. If you get an HR-enabled Fitbit, you can turn off HR when you want to see sleep quality, or leave it on when you want sleep stages. But it can't do both simultaneously. All the Fitbits I've used are the same in terms of sleep accuracy. Fitbit doesn't advertise any of the models as being more accurate that way, so you're free to choose almost any of them. Here's some more information you may find helpful:https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163

Hello @Forbesm, thanks for posting and your feedback. I will gladly assist. 
 
Please note that you can still check different details regarding your sleep log. You also get the amount of time you spent asleep on each log. Tap on the sleep log to get further details. If you wish to see an average sleep time for a week or month, follow these steps:

Open the Fitbit app
Tap on the sleep tile

At the top you have a column chart, which you can swipe on. 


Swipe left on the chart until you reach the last one.
Tap on the chart. You will get the weekly average. You can also check a monthly average. 

Hope this helps. Thanks again for the feedback. 
 
If you have any other question or concern, please let us know.

Sleep stages are not being recorded in detail.... so there is no record of the amount of deep sleep for example.  This seems to be an intermittent problem, but annoying nonetheless.  This occurred both before and after the time change, so I do not think that this the cause of this issue
Thank you. I’ll give it a try.
Wilson,I have been using the Mindfulness/Meditations for Sleep/"Equal Breathing" tool every night to improve my sleep score.It has been very successful in helping me fall asleep. I have used it several times to fall back asleep when I wake up in the middle of the night (typically happens 2 or 3 times per week)This app has also lowered my sleeping heart rate. :^)BUT I am getting bored with this introductory version of Equal Breathing and would like to get a more advanced version.I have investigated other breathing apps but I really enjoy the background music and Marty's voice.Any chance for an Advanced Equal Breathing activity? Thanks,Carson
I started a thread on this topic and my inbox blew up with like minded people responded similarly.  I was following the topic to see how Fitbit would respond only to found out that I would have to pay for a premium version really pissed me off.  I was a loyal user and this is my third device but agree with others who are looking elsewhere and will do so during this holiday season.
OK this community forum needs a little work. A quick post by accident and I can’t find a way to edit my previous post.   Anyway, you can go in the Fitbit app. Going to the sleep area and in the upper right I think there is an ellipsis you can click on.    Then you can add a sleep log.   You can’t have overlapping sleep logs but you can try to fill in the gap’s on your sleep log where is broken.
So I bought a Nectar Memory Foam bed a couple months ago. It's great and a fabulous improvement from the old box spring bed I was using. BUT...it seems the Fitbit sleep tracking function doesn't produce accurate results anymore. I was hoping and excited to see my sleep score jump into the 90's when sleeping on my new bed. However, now the monitoring is broken. There are always large gaps in the results and Fitbit doesn't log the starting sleep time and the wake up time accurately. I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem when sleeping on one of these hybrid beds. Let me know your experience with sleep track and hybrid bed, specifically Nectar beds. Thanks.
I tried that--it works as well as writing down what time I fall asleep on a piece of paper by the bed, then jotting down the time I wake up when I open my eyes.It's difficult to find any useful info online, and if you call, the poor person at the other end is apparently locked in an underground bunker with a million other people, all talking at once.Do not waste your money on this useless and frustrating--and expensive--piece of plastic!
Most of us have bought this Fitbit in order to track sleep the way that it was and now you have taken and "F'd" it all up just leave it alone. If we wanted to play games we would have bought a Nintendo.
I have he flex and I was wondering which modal is the most intelligent in showing sleep pattern.My flex needs to be put to sleep to record, and many times I forget to wake it up and it shows me asleep when I am breaking my back working in the yard! Does anyone else has an answer?

Arise Awake stop not till the goal is reached.
I have a bunch of these too. I believe they are moments of restlessness. Like I have restless legs and it affects my arms too, so I twitch throughout the night. I believe these little red lines are times where the Fitbit noticed my movements but they were of such short duration that it did not warrant an actual lift in the graph bar.
I'm not having that much of a problem.  Which Fitbit do you have?  I understand it does make a difference.I have a slightly older Fitbit Charge 3.  I compare it to my Garmin watch every day.  I wear both to bed, LOL.My problem is just with the sleep score.  When I wake and then go back to sleep, I get the right amount of sleep hours, but I get 2 separate sleep scores; both show fair to poor sleep.I think I should be getting one combines sore showing fair to good sleep.Thanks for the comment.
That's what they say but I tend to sleep better if I have some coffee in the evening. I don't know.
You can find a manual for your device at the bottom of this page. Just go to your device under device help and it will show you an online owners manual.

@TiffanyBecker It's a pleasure! 
 
@alexthecat Interesting! 😮 I found that a way to fight revenge bedtime procrastination is to begin your nightly routine early. Set an alarm for an hour before you would normally begin getting ready for bed. Giving yourself this extra time to wind down from the day may help you feel more sleepy, which may help you resist the urge to stay up late.
 
See you around.

I would look for fixing the adrenal first, I met with sleep doctor and he confirmed the adrenal fatigue will foul up your sleep,  I cppap can help if your O2 drops and can help you get rest but the adrenal comes first. good luck
Am I doing something wrong that there are no replies?
I have a fit bit version called fit bit inspire 2, I find that it does not track sleep the best - that I think it registers myself as sleeping even if I am actually not asleep and am just lying down trying to fall asleep doing nothing. Does anyone know if there is a fit bit version that would actually track my sleep better, record the actual time I am sleeping? I do not know much about fit bits, not used this website much. The main reason why I got the inspire two was to try to track sleep, I am going to want to try to track sleep more seriously now, does anyone have any recommendations or thoughts? Thanks.

Hi All, 
For the last couple of months, I have begun to discipline my lifestyle in all aspects, initially it was very difficult to fight my unhealthy food habits.  But now I am managed to overcome that unhealthy eating habits.
Still, the only thing i was still struggling is, with is my sleep. I am trying to improve it, in all possible ways. But still, i am getting only 4-5 hours of sleep. that too after 4 AM. 
 
I am writing this post to see if there are any good suggestions, I am ready to try it out, below are the thing i have tried to get better sleep. but still struggling.
I am taking Vitamin - D, B12, omega 3 at the noon.
 
1. Painted my Bedroom color to darker color ( dark green ) 
2. installed blackout curtains
3. Neatend & put the things in place. 
4. Setting thermostat to 68 F for the night 
5. Started avoiding even kindle and moved back to the reading physical book 
6. Avoided coffee after 3 PM 
7. Doing gym 5 PM to 6 PM 
8. No food after 9 PM 
9. Planning to buy blue light filter glasses. 
 
After doing all this I am unable to have better sleep. any other way you guys tried and worked out for you guys. please share i am really open to trying those things. 
 
Hope you all can relate and understand my sleepless nights.

Hi, @susansusan , your phone not having battery will have no affect on the sleep detection on your Inspire HR.  However, if the Inspire HR had low battery, that could be the reason.  It is also possible that your wrist was flexed in such a way that your HR could not easily be read. It is also possible that this info simply hadn’t synced through.  I have noticed that occasionally some stats do not come through immediately, but are available later.  Did you check to see if it has now appeared?

I sometimes fall asleep on the couch while watching TV for a few hours (so earlier than my regular bedtime), and then wake up for an hour or even two before getting tired and going back to bed for a few more hours. My fitbit (I have the Flex 2) either misses the first sleep OR logs this as two separate sleep events. In either case, I usually edit my sleep log(s) so that it is one continuous sleep period with a long awake period in the middle but I am wondering in terms of tracking it would be better to log it as two separate sleep events? When they are logged as two separate events it appears as if I haven't met my sleep goa - however, I did notice one time that both events were starred, not sure what that meant. What are the pros and cons of each method?
Hello @solarslurpie, it's great to see you around! 
 
Nice! you've been doing a great job in trying to improve your HRV. 😊 
 
Well, HRV varies from person to person. Age, sex, sleep, hormones, circadian rhythm, and other factors (for example, caffeine or alcohol intake, exercise, and stress) can affect HRV.
 
But I have some tips that could help to improve it: 
 

Wear your device for at least 1 full day (during the day and to sleep at night). 
Make sure the back of your device is in contact with your skin. The band should be snug but not constricting. If you experience any discomfort, loosen the band, and if it persists give your wrist a break by taking it off.
Most metrics require at least 3 hours of quality sleep. If you move a lot during your sleep or the sleep session is too short, you might not get a reading too.

Hi @SunsetRunner  while I don't have a Fitbit tracker, it's a little expensive for my salary, maybe in the future, I use a free app and I'm very interested here. because I love the product. I tried to watch breathing meditation before going to bed...I would add the sound of the surf or the sounds of a waterfall as background music...yes, water calms me...meditation doesn't always help me, although it is very effective...
Restauration Rates. Which are yours?Hi! I´m a woman 48 and my "Frecuencia cardiaca durmiendo" it´s in general too high. I´m usually above 20 which does not allow me to a quiet sleep. I want to share it with you in order to know if the same happens to anybody else. Thanks!
My ex said she'd leave me if the light on my charge 2 didn't stop coming on at night. I told her I wished I'd bought it sooner. That's when the fight started.

My Trendweight
I am generally in bed for 9-10 hours. It takes me 20-25 minutes to fall asleep. I wake up 6 - 10 times a night and am awake for 10-20 minutes each time I wake up. I average about 6 hours of sleep a night, but I haven't calculated the average efficiency.

Why would you force sleep score on us is my question.  I just want to track sleep hours not some complicated and convoluted way.  Please make this optional, and bring back the old way.
Yeah, I gave up on sleep tracking with fitbit. Sensitive looks like I am up all night and Normal looks like I fall asleep in 30 seconds and sleep 9 hours straight until I immediately get up so its not very worthwhile in my opinion.
I love the sleep tracker. I am always tired, and now I know how restless of a sleeper I am! That said, I have no idea how to improve it!!
My Fitbit HR did. It record my sleep last night. When I tried to manually record it, it said that I can't record when there is already a sleep log for it. However, the sleep log isn't showing up...why???? It has worked SO well until now.

What goals should I have for hours of sleep each night and hours awake?I tend to sleep about seven and have about one awake.
If you're referring to seeing just times awake, restless, etc instead of REM, Light, etc... if the sleep record is not long enough, it doesn't show the REM, etc.  I believe I'd seen 3 hours to be the minimum for it to display the detailed info.  My recent history reflects this as well.

Here is how I was able to have my sleep cycles display in full REM and DEEP and LIGHT again after they converted to a less detailed format.
 
In the settings mode (desktop not phone app) scroll down to sleep and change the setting to 'sensitive'. It brought the original sleep scores back the next night. Good Luck!

I find that if I get a good workout in the morning, then I tend to sleep better that night. If I try to work out in the evening, I don't get the same effect.
You might want to research exposure to "blue light" such as computer screens or tv or ipads, iphones and kindles. These things can throw off your sleep cycles badly. Limit their use near bedtime. Im sorry for your troubles.
Hi @SunsetRunner i totally agree with your message. The days that i have had late dinners i tend to be awake for at least an hour before going into sleep. But the days when i have early dinner and relax just by reading a book or watching a television show before by cut-off time i tend to go to sleep within minutes. Also tend to avoid any arguments with family members 1 or 2 hours before sleep time as well prepares your body to get ready for sleep. I do not do actual "meditation" a lot since reading a book and using the relax app on my Ionic makes up for the meditation i think. Everyone needs to find what relaxes them towards the end of the day. But i think deep breathing exercises before going to sleep is a must. Cheers👍
As others have noted, sleeptrack only records your "last" sleep during the night. If you get up and it takes a while to fall back asleep, sleeptrack overlooks your first sleep of the night.Why can't the software be written to allow an additional sleep session if it starts within a set time of the first session ending? Would this be so difficult? (I assume the writers all sleep through the night and have no experience with waking and then falling back asleep.) If the objective is for people with sleeping difficulties to track their sleep, why doesn't the software accommodate these users. (FITBIT ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION?)
Correct, it is looked on as a previous day nap mid-afternoon, or even mid-morning. If you were desperate enough and were willing to mess up and maybe lose sleep stages and sleep score, I suppose you could delete the 8:30-10:30 sleep, then edit sleep time and say the one sleep session started at 8:30 the previous night and see what that gave you for results - guessing end up with one session with big wake time in the middle but not sure.

I think most adults have really strange sleep patterns. I think they are dependent on what we ate, watched, did, didn't do, worried about, should be worried about- list is long. If most mornings you wake up not tired, then I think you just experience what the rest of us do.. strange sleep patterns. If of course you wake up tired every single morning, then I would say for sure have it checked out. I think if you are a labored breather or snorer you are more likely to develop sleep apnea.. but that might just be me basing an opinion off of hearing friends with spouses who have it. Apparently it is very noisy at night..

I have tried many of your recommendations and they work. Extra pillow make a big difference! I use one on each side as I am a side sleeper and by elevating my knee, I have no more hip pain. I wanted to comment on one more idea that I have experienced. I have gone low carb and no sugar since 1/1/21. It has eliminated almost all joint pain. My blood work has improved and my rheumatologist is quite pleased. I have lost 13 pounds as I don't count calories and am close to my goal weight. Many people find significant weight loss on this type of plan. I think it is very easy to do and I am a lousy dieter. The incentive of no pain is quite a motivator! I am 67 with an autoimmune disease.
Actually, I can't access benchmark info on the dashboard so I don't know.HIM46

It's not recording my exercise properly either. I did an hour of bodypump tonight and it said I'd done a 17 minute run! Haha maybe it's just a funny watch but I'll speak to them at the store.Sent from my iPhone
Same thing for me. Has anyone tried a different hr tracker like apple or carmín to compare??
New Fitbit Alta HR user here.  I've had two very restful nights of sleep in a row, and the Fitbit tracker recorded <1 hour in deep phase each time out of 7:30 total sleep. I know this is false for a few reasons: First, I subjectively feel very fresh and rested upon waking. No drowsiness whatsoever. Second, I also am still using my old trackers for comparison (a Misfit Ray and a Mi Band 2), both which indicated more than 35% of total in deep sleep. I also recall several dreams which makes me skeptical of such a high % of light sleep. I am a vivid dreamer, especially since supplementing with Magnesium at night. Finally, I awoke at least once last night because of tingly hands due to staying in one position too long (side sleeper). That's an indication of deep sleep.  So now I'm reading that HR-based Fitbits use heart rate fluctuation in their calculations. Since I'm an endurance athlete with a resting HR in the low 40s, a few beats here and there is pretty significant.  I would say to other Fitbit users to take the sleep analysis with a HUGE grain of salt.
Hi @garnish, Fitbit developers monitor the Feature Suggestion portion of the site, which is the best place for your idea.

Hi, I'm restless 10x to 24x per night!!  Just wondered what most folks average.
Getting sufficient REM sleep has connections  with the circadian rhythm. Are you sleeping in a very dark room and getting enough light exposure early in the day?
I also have PLMD, and the fitbit is quite good at tracking it. I'm impressed by how well it seems to track it. My movements match up time-wise to the times during the night when I move the most (from about 2:30 AM onward). Each morning, I can pretty accurately guess what the fitbit sleep reading will say, based on how well I think I slept - if I wake up feeling like I had a good restful night (rare), the fitbit confirms it. If I wake up feeling awful, like I was half awake all night, the fitbit also confirms it. Fun! (haha)
thanks for info) something was new for me
Sixty percent is not good sleep. You may want to evaluate your caffeine intake. People often say that they can drink caffeine before bed and still go to sleep.  The problem is that when that occurs, your sleep is neither deep nor restful.  Try to experiment with it.   Because of the way that caffeine interacts with the body, if you go to bed at 10 pm, then the last caffeine that you should have is at 2:30.  The other concern is that if you have a large dose of caffeine from noon to 2:30, it would also cause you to have poor sleep. I hope that this helps.
are you sleeping soundly or are you waking up? I ask because 7 hours of good quality sleep seems pretty good. I would love that. I am in bed for 7 hours but I average about 4 hours of good sleep which most days is OK, but on others I feel exhausted. I don't ever feel like I catch up on sleep- it doesn't take away the exhaustion on the day I feel it so I typically don't bother. I do however, once in awhile take a cat nap on the weekends. That makes me feel so much better and ready for the rest of the day...

I have the opposite problem. It’s showing me drastically low REM results. I’ve even been woken up by my alarm from a dream & it isn’t tracking it. I’m not that confident in it’s results
I completed the two week sleep study, I completed the survey everyday. I still haven't received an email for my free month of Fitbit premium. Any insight on this or was it a scam?Thanks
Hi @PaulTomp212,The causes of tiredness are many, and difficult to track down oneself. I would start by having a blood test done to eliminate things like organ dysfunction. You may find it helpful to keep a daily journal of your activity and rate your energy level on a scale of 1 to 10. By doing this for a few months, I was able to track down my tiredness to a fried-out nervous system.

Before you spend the money at the doctor and on a sleep study, assuming you have an S/O in bed with you most nights, ask them.  They can provide some detail (are you sleeping through the night, are you rolling over, do you kick, etc,)  Most likely if you aren't sleeping then they aren't either. Also make sure your fitbit is set to regular, not sensitive, for sleeping.
How to figure out if it’s normal
I know for me, i just changed shifts at work and i now work nights and im trying to adapt to sleeping during the day. Being able to track my sleep helps because if i see i was really restless I can think back and see if i had too much caffeine or forgot to eat or something that was causing it. Just helps me adjust my own schedule a bit....personal preferences.
In regards to what I previously posted. There is also a syndrome called "restless leg syndrome". But usually you have problems during the day with your legs cramping up. With Regards to sleep apnea. You need to ask yourself, Am I waking up tired, sleepy during the day, falling asleep @ inappropriate times. Does your mate complain of you snoring? These are the type of questions the Dr. will ask you.
i think I'll hang on to mine, but it seems to confuse 'still' with 'sleeping'. I download a sleep app for my phone which I'm going to try tonight and see how the readings compare.
@Kirsten1983  Once you're out of bed, are you tired? The meds you're taking can make it hard to get to sleep, which explains your struggle with it. Have you done any research on Citalapram? You shouldn't be drinking while taking it and you've mentioned being hungover. Have you spoken to your health care professional about this? The answer could be as simple as a change of medication or some tests to determine the root cause of this. If you don't already, try keeping a journal of your sleep as well as your acitivities. Maybe you and your doctor can figure something out. Welcome to the forums.

Hi, I've been removing my Charge 4 at night as I hate the sleep score function. I thought I would be interested in how well I slept but it's proved the opposite. I think I slept worse knowing my sleep was tracked. I should get to judge how well I slept, not the watch. I would like to keep wearing the watch at night for the heart rate/calorie etc functions but want to remove the sleep function. Is this possible at all? Thanks
Hi WilsonFitbit, Thank you.  I think what ever works for individuals is best for them.  They just have to find out what works.  The sleep tracking is one of the great things I like about Fitbit Premium.  It has the information I find useful to help me answer that question. Cheers!
Hello everyone! Thanks to all of you for your suggestions. I found interesting that I wasn't the only that listens to music when going to sleep.
 
@EdsonFitbit, thanks for replying. I tried once your suggestion, mostly I listen to rain sounds and it was both, relaxing and refreshing after a hard day.
 
@YojanaFitbit, instrumental is always great. I believe a good sleep time isn't about the amount of hours you were able to sleep, but the quality and nothing better than music (or at least for me) to sleep pretty well. 😴
 
@DavideFitbit, I was able to try your suggestions and they helped me a lot. I even try to listen to Mozart and Back while doing homework and it helped me to concentrate.

'Begin sleep now' was originally for trackers without heart rate monitors that could only detect sleep from lack of motion.  If you have a tracker with heart rate monitor, you are better off not using 'begin sleep now".  However I do use it occasionally if I want it to record a nap of less than an hour that is too short to otherwise be detected, with the understanding I will not get full details on it.

Did you know that people who work the late shift have a higher risk of developing breast and colon cancer? Researchers believe light exposure reduces melatonin levels. Melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, is thought to protect against cancer as it appears to suppress the growth of tumors. Be sure that your bedroom is dark and avoid using electronics before bed in order to help your body produce the melatonin it needs.
Hi all, I'm a 22yo working female. On an SSRI (Lexapro), but have no major other health issues. I've started to become concerned because my deep sleep statistics are far below the benchmark for women my age. On a normal night, I get between 25 minutes-1 hour of deep sleep. It's usually either too small of a percentage to show, or about 12% of my total sleep. My REM statistics are normal and I sleep 6-7 hours a night, 8-9 on weekends. What could be causing this lack of deep sleep? Could I just be a lighter sleeper than most? thanks for your help!!

You're right, since most doctors recommend to cut off screen time 1 hour before bed. It's best if you can just read a book or a magazine before going to bed or try to do something else, listen to a podcast, drink something some tea or milk... Another solution is activating night mode or Night Shift mode (converts the on-screen color spectrum from blue to yellow), if you must to check your phone before going to bed. 😎

I think that is great that you are sleep walking.  Seriously, how many steps to your bathroom and how many times to you get up during the night?
24 hours and counting, if the help desk does not work in the weekends, it is better to indicate that when a chat is started!
@Specky   It's hard to read your graph details because of its size.  Can you edit it and enlarge it?  The reason I'm asking is something looks wrong with the display.  On my Restoration graph, everything above the middle dashed line is light lavender and everything below it is darkThe dashed line is at 53, my RHR that day.  That's high for me. The top and bottom lines balance out the graph.  To me, if the colors were right, your sleeping heart rate is below your RHR more than 90% of the time.

I agree, I take the fitbit off at night and only wear it during the day. The light on the charge 2 wakes me up so sleep better without it!
I'm wondering this as well. I realize I'm a few years after the post, but new to fitbit. I think the 1 hour awake that Fitbit registers wasn't taken into consideration when people recommend 8 hours of sleep, so I tend to agree with your choice of B. And, to be honest, I'm not sure we really are awake for that hour. The algorithm that fitbit uses to determine where you are asleep or not is based on movement. So, I think you would not be able to move the whole night for the whole night to be registered as sleep on a fitbit, and I'm not sure that just because you move you are awake! Yes, I'm in same boat. To get 8 hours I need to be in bed by 8:30 on worknights. That's hard to do with kids, chores, any time to relax after work.
Hey, thanks for responding alexthecat!Problem is I can't attribute it to any change in habits or timing of exercise. And I didn't feel rested in the morning. I do have insomnia, though, so my sleep scores for Restoration are always a bit dicey. The higher sleeping heart rate though is new just in the past couple of days, the graph above being the worst.

A Fitbit without heart rate monitoring will show you basic restless and awake time. I would check out the Ionic, which has heart rate monitoring and is waterproof.

This is an extract from one of the help files: "Your overall sleep score is a sum of your individual scores in sleep duration, sleep quality, and restoration, for a total score of up to 100. Most people get a score between 72 and 83. Sleep score ranges are:Excellent: 90-100Good: 80-89Fair: 60-79Poor: Less than 60Duration: Time asleep and awakeHow much you slept—the more you sleep, the better your score.Quality: Deep & REM sleepHow much time you spent in deep and REM sleep—the more time you spend in these sleep stages, the better your score.Restoration: Sleeping heart rate & restlessnessHow relaxed you were during sleep—a high sleeping heart rate or too much tossing and turning lowers your score.Note that you must see sleep stages to see sleep score. For more information, see What should I know about sleep stages?"
Answered my own question. Sorry for the trouble. Typical for others like you, not your personal typical.  Topic: "How do I use the sleep stages ..."  https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htm

This is exactly what is happening to me.  I could care less about seeing my time asleep or awake (duh, I know that!) I want to see when I'm in deep, light or rem, and for how much time.  I got it for Christmas, and since then, it's only recorded those aspects 8 times...I've been searching and though others seem to have the same problem, I can't seem to find a solution.
I can earn points for tracking sleep with my company which uses Castlight.  now that fitbit no longer tracks sleep, I agree that it's now time to move to another tracker.  Thanks for the kick in the pants FitBit.
Hello @Mindraid, welcome to the community forums! 
 
Charge 3 supports Smart Wake. When setting an alarm, turn on Smart Wake. This allows your tracker to find the best time to wake you starting 30 minutes before the alarm time you set. It avoids waking you during deep sleep so you're more likely to wake up feeling refreshed. If Smart Wake can't find the best time to wake you, your alarm alerts you at the set time. 
 
In addition, devices like the Versa 3 and Sense also support Smart Wake. For more information, please check: 
How do I manage alarms on my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps!

Alright there tough guy no need to be a douchbag about it clearly there was some misundersanding so why don't you stop biting peoples heads off and chill out. Oh and yea if your commenting on a fitbit forum page it's assumed that your talking about a fitbit product. And the reason the software is mentioned is because the software controlls what the wearable does.
@MelWitty Nice to see you around and thanks for your great input! 😊

I’m just wondering if anyone has the same type of sleep log as I do? I suffer from ME/CFS and bought my Fitbit to track my steps as I’m on the pace program.  I love my Fitbit because it tells me how I’ve slept as with my condition I don’t always get much sleep.  What at I have noticed over the last month though is that my sleep log is telling me I didn’t fall asleep until 6 or 7am.  So I’m only getting about 3-4 hours sleep. The problem is that I though I fell asleep about 4am as I know I was still awake at 3am.   Has as anyone got any ideas as to why it looks as though I’ve not slept, I’ve been wondering if I’ve been just dozing and not really been asleep.I thought I fell asleep at 4am? ld love to hear from others who have found this problem.
Thank you Pat.  I will try that, tho' sometimes naps just sneak up on me and I wake up later just a bit surprised, LOL!
@Jknox65 wrote:Well I just started getting the score and it's nice. I agree there’s value added in it, compared to the previous way of presenting things. It helps putting things like sleep stages into perspective, to see how they impact the quality of your sleep.

Since COVID and my ability to work from home, my sleep log is completely wrong. I’m constantly deleting “naps” and adjusting my wake time. I make a point of moving around every hour, but still it’s recorded as sleep. Is anyone else having this problem?

Are you referring to the silent alarms on the Surge itself?  I typically let the Surge autodetect if I'm sleeping. My silent alarms on my Surge seem unaffected by that. I'll try initiating sleep mode from my iPhone tonight and see if that behaves any differently.
I've tried something odd, before going to bed I usually work out or finish some chores; then I go for a warm shower. I sleep like a baby.

see i tap it every time i am about to try to go to sleep, i don't know what it is supposed to do but all that happens is the lights go back and forth. What else is supposed to happen when i tap on it? And where am i supposed to tap?ma
Update: For the last 5 days the sleep score has been showing. I changed the way I use the app. Instead of using the app and selecting 'begin sleep', I just go to sleep while wearing the fitbit as usual and dont start anything on the app. The next morning the fitbit app automatically figures out that I've been sleeping and gives me a nice score for it. Gnite!
My Charge 5 has been consistently tracking my sleep every night for weeks. I've gotten a Sleep Score every single night -- until last night. I slept more than 6 hours. I've got detailed data on sleep stages, as well as the full range of Health Metrics for the night (Breathing Rate, HRV, etc.). But the FitBit app won't give me a Sleep Score. It just says "Not enough quality sleep data was collected." I've tried stopping the app and clearing cache (I'm on Android). I've tried restarting my Charge 5. I'm not sure what else to do. Any suggestions?
I have my Charge set to sensitive. I have 1 hour 35 minutes unaccounted for in sleep graph. This is time I know I was in bed. I have searched fitbit help for explanation of gray in sleep graph with no results for this issue. I did not take steps during this time period either so was not out of bed asleep.I have multiple sleep problems and this is why I purchased my fitbit. I need help with this glitch in the sleep graph. Thank you.

This feature is a total waste of time.  It does not track sleep.  I go to bed at the same time.  I read for 15 minutes until my eyes get sleepy, then I drop off to sleep.  Fitbit, however, does not BEGIN to track my sleep until an hour after I stop moving.  Then, whether or not I awaken, if i move AT ALL, It logs no sleep.  I often get 3 hrs of sleep period for a night, because If I should happen to roll over before midnite, it ends my sleep for the entire night.   It is a waste to use this feature for any information on your sleep quality, as Fitbit has no idea whatsoever.  I used to have a Fitbit one back in 2010.  That device did track actual sleep.
Hi @Kvetcher Idont believe it will change anything. As far as I am aware they are different and separate items

Having trouble w versa 2, staying sync and tracking my sleep. I've tried to erase it and download it again, but I can't keep it in sync. What am I doing wrong?
 
 
Moderator edit: updated subject for clarity
After you take off your fitbit, open up the app on your phone and do a manual sync.  Or just open up the app.  Seems if I use the app at all, it knows I'm awake, and ends the sleep session.

Sleep score should be made optional ASAP.  If that doesn’t happen, I may stop using my Fitbit.  The score often makes me feel bad about how I slept — even when it’s a “good” ranking.  I think too much about the difference between an 83, 84, 85, or, say, an 87.  And the device can not be that precise!  Give us the option to remove the sleep score ASAP!  Please!!!  Please!!!
YES, @heavyfort , their activity will affect your sleep tracking. But it may be worth it.
There can be so many things under our sun for us all to try and diagnose your issue. I believe if you are concerned with sleep, a doctor is the best person to talk to. They would know your habbits, medications, and health history. I am having sleep issues, I have tried everything except medicated sleep. I dont feel like I am doing myself a healthy favor by putting toxic drugs in my body. So I will be visiting my doctor soon. I am only in my 20s too. But good luck and bless you!
Well I saw my doctor and after having blood tests come back clear I saw a specialist and had an oximeter test overnight. I don't know yet what it showed but I have to go in for a full appointment but cant get in until September.So all I know right now is that something isn't right, but I don't know what and I don't know how bad.
Hi @Jessica_r Welcome to the community. I'm sorry to hear you are having an issue with your Inspire HR. Have you checked to make sure HR monitoring it on? Have you tried restarting your tracker? If you need instruction on how to restart your tracker, you can find them HERE. Fingers crossed that helps you.

Hmm... can't find any specs comparison. Regarding accuracy, are those changing from device to device? Do all the Fitbit devices have the same algorithm for measuring sleep quality etc? Not interested in design and other features, just looking for most accurate Fitbit sleep tracking device.
I am new to tracking sleep and I don’t know whether this is normal.  My Fitbit tells me I’m waking up a huge number of times throughout the night, around 40 times or more, but most of these are so short I don’t remember them. My awake time average is 11%.  I am more concerned about the frequency of waking. I wake up to an alarm and never feel fully rested even after long hours of sleep. I rate or use caffeine or alcohol. I have no trouble falling asleep.   I am a little below average on rem and deep sleep. Is this normal or is there anything I can do to improve this?
I hope they change this soon, because my sleep chart is almost useless if I don't know what time it is when my sleep was interrupted.
and I found this https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Better/Racing-mind-at-night/m-p/1769930#M4031 four pages of replies... maybe something helpful?

Hello, I start using Versa synchronised with Sleep as Android to track sleep and have a smart alarm, Im looking for  combining the versa and sleep as androind, despite knowing that they can do it individually.When I tracked my sleep last night with sleep as android, activate the watch on it, with fitbit app already installed, I got light sleep all night on sleep as android, and different tracking in fitbit app..My watch is not that tight, both apps installed, bluetooth activated, tracking sleep on android on, with mentionning using fitbit smartwatch.Does somebody have the same issue? Any tips so Sleep as android can track correctly my sleep with Versa?Thank you in advance.Amine.
Have you been tested for sleep apnea? I never thought I had it. Between my apnea device and a Fitbit Versa, I know how long I cycle in and out of sleep cycles and how much sleep I get each night.
My Flex 2 did not log any of my sleep last night and today it wants me to log it manually, this does not make any sense as how would I know where to begin? I know when I went to bed and when I got up but I don't know how many times during the night I woke up or how many restless times I had during the night, that is what we bought the Flex 2 for! What is the point if you can not rely on it?
Hi Fitbit Community. I'm interested in the percentages placed against sleep results. As a Fibromyalgia convalescent I have a problem getting enough Deep sleep and find my fitbit a useful resource on days when I think I've slept well but actually feel grim because my deep sleep has been as low as only 16 mins. Interestingly, last  night it was considerably better. 65 mins Yet it suggested I was only in deep sleep 11%. Since deep sleep is only 150 mins a night this percentage surely should reflect how long it SHOULD be  within  the150 mins deep sleep allocation for 8hrs rest, rather than overall compared to light REM and awake?

I started wearing a Fitbit to bed last week, with the free account.  I was getting a sleep score every night, and it told me how much time I was spending in each sleep phase, which I thought was pretty cool.  Then I started a Premium free trial, because I thought it would give me even more detailed info---but it turns out that having Premium actually took away all the interesting sleep stuff.  Last night was my first night with Premium, and it didn't give any information about the sleep phases.    Am I missing something?  Why would having Premium remove a useful feature that exists in the free version?
I have found meditation really helps improve my sleep patterns. Just tried an experiment - I meditated in the afternoon using my FitBit in sleep mode. I ended up with 32 minutes of sleep and an improvement in my % of over 10%....and it really revived me.
To select "normal" or "sensitive" sleep setting, click the cog symbol at the upper right in Dashboard, then setttings, then devices, then select Charge HR.  Sleep settings are near the bottom of the page.
Hr enabled fitbits show sleep stages, non HR fitbits measure sleep quality. Which do you prefer?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Sorry, but I don't think Fitbit could help you in that respect because it is just measuring skin temperature which doesn't necessarily correspond to internal temperature such as measured by a fever thermometer or infrared sensor "gun".

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Yeah, I can read the FAQ as well as anyone. My question is: does the sleep score derive from the percentage of time spent in say REM sleep as compared to the total time spent sleeping? If that is the case, the sleep score discounts the time in light sleep. So it doesn't mean anything.  Second, I want to know whether using the HRV is equivalent to using the "electroencephalogram to detect brain activity along with other systems to monitor eye and muscle activity"? What is the correlation between the two methods, if any.  I also want to know just how far off the HRV method is in determining the stages of sleep. Thanks
I have sleep apnea.  I had corrective surgery for it.  The surgery's nickname is called UVPPP.  ENT can provide information and perform the surgery.  It helped for about 6 months, then it seemed to return some.  I see from my new fitbit I still have some issues with disturbed/restless sleep although it is not as bad as it was.  I have tried all kinds of sleep aids and prefer benadryl as it is safe and good for my allergies.
Looks like a glitch to me. Which Fitbit tracker do you use? Do you use it mostly for tracking your sleep? The reason I'm asking is you've had extremely low step counts since March 19.

When it comes to sleep, like the majority of points in life, Vilafinil is miracle drug or medicine. Sleep help are in fact not indicated for lasting use. Can anybody share their experiences about how to take care of sleep problems?
 
Moderator Edit: Formatting
I have a similar issue too. If I wake up halfway and spend too much time awake before going back to sleep, the other half of my sleep is not counted as that day's sleep. So it would say I had 4 hours of sleep that day, 45 mins of awake time, and an additional 3 hours of sleep the next day.  Is there a way to make Fitbit count the full 7 hours toward that nights' sleep time?
Hi @WavyDavey it only happens now and then, I was wondering if might just be down to my condition.  Thanks, Alex
I tink you might have sleep apnea. I had the same problem before I got dianosed with it. It is worth a shot but do you ever stop breathing while you sleep? Or have someone told you that? Or snore pretty bad?
i dont think that i can help you but you could email fitbit customer support about it,
@Addy71As @Dominique suggests it is caused by restless sleep, which in turn can be caused by snoring/sleep apnea. If you have any concerns it is best to discuss this with a doctor. You might get a sleep study done to see if you have apnea or if there is a possible other cause.

I've received a sleep score every night for months until last night.  My default sleep goal is 8 hours.  Last night, I had a great nights sleep - over 10 hours.  On the Fitbit dashboard on the Iphone I see a message that says 'You did it' but there is no sleep score.  I have slept more than 10 hours in the past and received a sleep score and no 'You did it' message.  So... what does 'You did it' mean?  I've received a sleep score of 90 in the past and no 'You did it' message.
Then the best thing you can do is workout when you get home or wake up extra early. Make a schedule and dedicate yourself to it.
Omg!!! The lights! I hate these green lights! This is my first night and it's ALL I see right in front of my face! Why????? It's horrible! I was going to return this tomorrow! If your hack doesn't work it's going back. I wake up from any light glowing on me! I have electrical tape on the smoke detector light even!! Lol
Before I start, it's important to add that I am not diagnosed with any sleep disorder of any sort. (Besides anxiety, ocd, depression, etc keeping me awake for some nights, but none have been so bad as to lead to this amount of sleep deprivation)I've always had some trouble falling asleep at night. But recently I haven't been able to fall asleep at night at all, which leads me phasing in and out of sleep during the day and highly affecting my overall life in a much negative way. Even with melatonin I still don't even feel tired. I have tried so many things, such as: fragrances, sleep masks, electronic cutoffs earlier than usual, music / sound machines, different blanket and pillow, eating / drinking times and habits before bed, and so on. I really need to solve this issue. Anyone and everyone with ANYTHING to say, no matter how small a comment, I would be ever so thankful and appreciative for you. Thank you.
YouI have been using the sleep application on my versa 4, but it's not consistent. I found another way to monitor my sleep on the same application. Should I be using one or the other?
@Esya It definitely threw me off, I think I was only about 17 at the time, too. All day long I couldn't really sit there and look at people in the eye properly even though I knew it was only a dream, but that is life I guess !
They are replacing my watch.  Had to mail the old one back before they would send the new one.  It has taken since Sept. 2nd and I am still waiting to receive it.  Do not have much faith that this is a real fix, since it seems that many have the same issue.  It must be a problem across the board, and was not just a "lemon."  However, it was worth a try before I decide to abandon fitbit altogether.
That's not bad at all. Since you only need to catch up a little sleep, weekend naps might work well for you.

What does everyone do for a good night sleep? its my biggest weakness with fit bit  i fall asleep with no issue but staying asleep? blah
@nataliesbhimraj It's the worst! You think you're in the clear, then something else irrelevant enters your mind...
I liked Fitbit! Life after sleep scores sneakily forced upon me ? No longer interested! When I can afford to replace I will immediately. Fitbit - this upgrade was a massive mistake. In life we learn from our mistakes and rectify them . “Every day’s a learning day” is what we say to our pupils. Please learn that your customers are an important asset.
Hi bbc4502,   I would like to add that perhaps you are just more relaxed once hubby is gone and you have the bed to yourself for that last hour.   My husband often leaves very early for work however, I do not see him off to work HA.  Once I hear the click of the door I get the best sleep of the night/morning!  Just got my Charge HR and my heart rate dips to a low of 47-49 (my resting HR is around 60 )and it happens to correspond with the time that I am totally zonked and it is usually in the early morning.
Don't go to bed before you're tired, then read a book or magazine for a while to totally switch off from the day and signal to your brain that it's time to switch off now.  Talk through your anxiety as it happens during the day, so that it's sorted before you want to sleep.  Do something that wipes you out during the day (ideally before lunch) so that your body is begging to go to sleep by the evening.  Avoid the age-old trap of letting your mind say "I should be asleep, but I can't" 'cos that'll result in more anxiety.  Have a lavender scented bubble bath (NOT shower) an hour before you head to bed so that your mind can start to relax and switch off.

	Amanda - a Fitbit Inspire user since 29th September 2019
mawitters- I am finding the exact same thing! On the normal setting, I was at 97-100% sleep accuracy. I switched it to sensitive and I am at 35% sleep efficiency on a regular basis. I have no idea what to do.
I have the same problem. The backlight comes on while I'm sleeping and bothers my wife enough that I've quit wearing my fitbit to bed, even though I'd like to have the sleep data. I'd really love having the ability to turn off the backlight completely at night. Note that I DO have Quick View turned off.  Apparently I bump the button sometimes when I roll over or adjust my pillow.  I have a Charge 2 running ver 22.55.2. Any help would be appreciated!
HI my husband just got me the fitbit.  So far I'm loving it but I'm sure there are a lot of features I don't know about.  I really want to measure my sleep because I don't sleep well at all so it would be cool to see just how much sleep I'm actually getting.  Can someone tell me how to do this.
What type of device do you have? I started with the Flex so I would manuallly have to log sleep until the software update allowed automatic detection. I notice that as long as I'm laying in bed still for a certain period of time my Charge HR will count that as "sleep" time, so it shows an extra 15-30 mins (depending on when I actually fall asleep) as sleep time. That may be the reasoning behind the ability to still log sleep manually.
That makes sense. 😔 Thank you very much.
I too would love to get more deep sleep, it's very elusive, lucky if I get 30 mins no matter how active I have been in the day.
FYI - reducing the range didn't lose any of the sleep data.  So that's something to be happy about.
The majority of those pink lines are 11 minutes. I have had this happen on multiple days, but perhaps, when you roll over in your sleep, that is the time it takes for the average person to get into a comfortable position and stop moving. I wouldn't put too much trust in the accuracy while sleeping though. Just use it as a guide to know if you slept more or less than other nights.
My biggest problem with sleep (and Fitbit tracking my sleep) is I wake up in the middle of the night, usually around 3:00 AM.  I've taken to working a puzzle such as SODUKO until my eyes get heavy.  I then roll over and fall asleep again.Fitbit records this as two separate sleep cycles.  Sometimes the second sleep cycle is short (about 2 hours) and I get no sleep score for it.  Sometimes the cycle is long enough that I get two sleep scores for the night, but both will typically be somewhat low numbers such as 60.Is there anyway to resolve the sleep score average for the night?  I tend to ignore the sleep score due to this and work with just the total number of hours of sleep.  I use the formula of total number of hours asleep divided by the total number of hours in bed to get a percentage of my sleep time.  80% is believed to be a healthy number. Thanks
So, here was last night's sleep with the device sensitivity set to "Normal."95%?  I don't think so.  I was up half the night, and that's no exaggeration. So, "Sensitive" is too..."sensitive" and "Normal" barely registers any disturbance. Is there a "Baby Bear" setting?  You know..."Just right"?
Not crazy at all, @dgilluly ! Sleep apnea can have serious, long term effects on your body. Smart to go to your doctor. Proof it’s smart is the fact he ordered a sleep study. You can do this! Let us know how it works out.
I have the latest.. Fitbit Surge.
I'm on day 2 of fitbit ownership (ChargeHR) and i'm very impressed.  I earn points on my health insurance for reaching step goals each day and last night i found myself going out for a little walk just to top up to hit my goal for the day.  It's already changing my behaviour! The only thing i'm not that impressed with is the sleep tracking.  I sometimes use an app called Sleep Cycle and it shows periods of deep sleep and light sleep, and it can also wake you up during the light sleep periods to make the transition to daytime easier.  I'm surprised that Fitbit can't recognise deep/light sleep based on the accelerometer data like my iPhone can.  Does anyone know if this is possible and if fitbit might consider developing this feature?

Hello @kneppster, welcome to the community forums! 
 
If you haven't done so, I recommend performing an update to the Fitbit App. For this, please make sure to follow the steps below: 
 
If you have an Android: 

Open the Play Store app.
Tap the menu icon in the top left.
Tap My apps & games. If the Fitbit app has an update, you’ll see it in the Updates list.
Tap Update.



If your apps update automatically, check the Recently updated or Up to date list to see if the Fitbit app was updated.


 
Hope this helps!

Mine has done this for two months……..no help
I’ve had my Fitbit for a week and it’s telling me that 6/7 nights I’ve had at least an hour of ‘time awake.’ The times I go to sleep and wake up and accurate, but I know I don’t wake up throughout the night. Last night it said I was awake for an hour and 20 minutes, but I definitely never woke up and slept really soundly throughout the night. It’s set to normal and not sensitive, could I just be moving a lot in my sleep?
This is an extract from one of the help files: "Your overall sleep score is a sum of your individual scores in sleep duration, sleep quality, and restoration, for a total score of up to 100. Most people get a score between 72 and 83. Sleep score ranges are:Excellent: 90-100Good: 80-89Fair: 60-79Poor: Less than 60Duration: Time asleep and awakeHow much you slept—the more you sleep, the better your score.Quality: Deep & REM sleepHow much time you spent in deep and REM sleep—the more time you spend in these sleep stages, the better your score.Restoration: Sleeping heart rate & restlessnessHow relaxed you were during sleep—a high sleeping heart rate or too much tossing and turning lowers your score.
Two nights in a row I have no sleep info. Everything else records fine. Anyone else have this issue?
Did you get HRV values from your Alpha HR (don't think there is any such Fitbit model)?  If not, I would be inclined not to compare Fitbit's HRV values to what you may have seen from other sources, but rather look at the trend of the Fitbit readings.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Hi @Twignest, It's hard to say because we're all so different, but it sounds fine to me. Getting less awake time than the average means the quality of your sleep is better. And for whatever reason your body uses that extra time in REM. Unless you see a huge decrease in deep sleep I think it sounds like you're getting good sleep.

To post an update on this. I did the sleep study and was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. Now I sleep with an APAP machine.
I wonder if anybody has transitioned from a tracker like the Flex to one of the trackers with a heart rate monitor (Charge HR, Blaze, Surge).  I really like the sleep tracking feature of my surge (I have severe sleep apnea and use a CPAP) coupled with the sleeping heart rate plot.  The two plots (sleep and heart rate) complement each other when there is gross movement (rolling over or paying a visit to the bathroom), but the HRM shows other transients such as how deep my sleeping state is as well as what I assume to be dream segments. So, if any of y'all have made the transition from non-tracked heart rate to a tracker with the HRM feature, what is your impression?
I was curious what other peoples "minutes to fall asleep" is?Mine is ALWAYS zero, and I was wondering if that could really be correct? I also have a 97%-%100% sleep efficiency most nights. Is this normal? Or am I blessed in the sleep realm? Jen

Check your HRV (heart rate variability) too (under Health Metrics). That is considered a measure of sympathetic activation (fight or flight response), so if it’s stress, it might show up there too. There are published HRV norms by age and sex — see where you stand. Practicing resonant breathing a.k.a. coherence can improve HRV (reduce physiological effects of stress).
I think that data and numbers are great. But sometimes those same numbers can cause a spiral of doubt when one shouldn't exist. How do you feel? do you feel rested? do you remember dreams or does the entire night just zoom by? Do you lie awake for hours or do you fall asleep relatively quickly? If the answers to all the questions aren't troubling, than I would suggest that your tracker is giving you what it perceives to be your sleep pattern on what I imagine is your pulse fluctuations through out the night. It is good information to have around patterns- are you more restless during the same time each night, did you sleep worse because you are coming down with a cold, etc... but I definitely wouldn't worry about any of it unless your answers indicate you should.

I find that if I get a good workout in the morning, then I tend to sleep better that night. If I try to work out in the evening, I don't get the same effect.

My primary care physican (who could be completely full of it) says that chronic insomnia hits women far more often than men.  He tells me women with chronic insomnia usually can't turn the brain off at night.  They go to bed thinking about the day, what they are planning for tomorrow, next week, etc.  For me he's not far off.  Nights I can't sleep I'm usually turning stuff around in my head and I just don't get over. When it gets really bad I'll take melatonin for up to a week to try and get my cycle back in sync.  If that doesn't help I'll add an over the counter sleep aid, but usually on the weekends.  Once I'm back into a more normal rythym it will take care of itself.  However, tonight is a perfect example - I need to be up around 5am and I haven't headed to bed yet!

I have tried sensative and normal mode and my experience has been that it does not recognize the amount of time I am awake.  For example, I do see a red line at a time when I know I was awake, but fitbit shows that I went right back to sleep when in actuallity I was laying very still trying to go back to sleep.  (It's like I can't get my brain to shut off.)  After a few nights I decided to test this.  When I would wake up in the middle of the night and lay there trying to fall back asleep if it went past 15 minutes and I still wasn't asleep I moved my arm.  On the fitbit it recorded that I woke up and fell back asleep for 15 minutes and woke up again.  So, if I want it to track the time I am laying there awake it would appear that I would have to keep moving my arm, which would of course make it even harder to fall back asleep.  I am sure I need to see a sleep specialist since it is very frustrating to lay there awake several times a night.  My husband doesn't have the sleep issues I have and he thought it was going to show no movement all night for his sleep.  It was really cool to see that he has a normal sleep cycle where he moves roughly every 90 minutes.
I no longer wear it to track sleep, but I do wear it at night for the alarm, I like the little buzz buzz tthat wakes me. 😴

Agreed the changes suck. Fitbit seems to have chosen bold graphics over content (as so often happens), probably to ease mobile device functionality. Bah humbug! In case anyone at Fitbit reads this -- say, that young developer who needs to change some bit of code in order to keep their job -- bring back the stacked sleep pattern display, so I can see trends in my sleep patterns over time, preferably a time segment I select, but at least a week. And add a clock to the nightly sleep pattern display. The old one wasn't great, but it was something.
Are you trying from your phone or computer? The app on the phone doesn't have all the features.
Hi @GraceGFitbit,That's a really good question. I've tried about all lengths of naps, from 10 minutes to an hour. For me, the longer ones, and ones after 3pm will make me feel groggy and interfere with sleeping later at night. Some people do like to take 1 hour naps because those longer ones can allow us to get into REM sleep stage. The research I've seen is undecided about naps. Some articles say they're not beneficial, others say they're good for health, memory and creativity. Some say longer naps are better, some say shorter are better. I think each person has to go with their instincts and try different lengths to see what works best. With fast-paced lifestyles, it's easy to not get enough sleep, so wherever we can work sleep in, seems like a good thing. I do find that napping works very well when done on a regular basis, and try to work in 1-2 naps of 20 minutes duration daily.  https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/napping/art-20048319 https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/napping-may-not-be-such-a-no-no This study is a long read, but has a lot of detail about different kind of naps. Sweet dreams!  

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Dear Fitbit Community, In university I am taking a class called: Sociology of sleep. We are discussing, reading, analyzing all aspects of sleep from a sociological perspective. Now at the end of the semester I have to write a paper about any aspect of sleep that I like. I am tracking steps, exercise and calories with fitbit but never really got into sleep tracking. I guess it is because I have no issues falling asleep and I usually feel rested in the morning and during the day.  So now I wonder what are the reasons for people to track their sleep? Of course i know about the health benefits of good sleep and so on. But I would like to hear some personal reasons for tracking sleep. - What are your (personal) reasons for monitoring your sleep? - Why did you start tracking?- What do you hope to gain from tracking your sleep? - Has tracking your sleep improved your life? - How so?  Please note that I would like to use your answers in my paper.The paper won't be published online and it will only be read by my professer. All names will be anonymized in my paper. I so appreciate it if you would help me and answer some of the questions stated above. Thanks so much in advance! - Kristina 🙂  P.S. I am a student in Germany. So please excuse any bad phrasing or spelling errors I made. I am posting this in the english speaking community because it is used more than the german one.
My Fitbit flex is just logging sleep when I am awake during the day. Why is it doing this. I've not damaged it or got it wet. Why is it malfunctioning?
Never mind. I figured it out.

I am averaging about 8 hours sleep a night but exhausted. ALL. THE. TIME.I just had my bloods checked and I'm ok there. This was a "good" nights sleep. I apparently woke up 42 times. The big wake up in the middle was a cat fight outside but I don't remember the others. Should I be asking to be checked for sleep apnoea?
Been researching this. Sounds like sleep apnea. I have this issue, too and going in for a study in a few weeks.
Wow, great information @WilsonFitbit. I didn't know that sleep problems constitute a global epidemic that threatens health. 😑 But it make sense, since when I don't sleep well I usually have a terrible next day.
 
Thanks for sharing this.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
Inspire 2 Fitbit In the quick menu, I turned off sleep in order to increase the brightness on my screen as mentioned in other searches. Does this turn off the tracking of my sleep as well? I wore it to bed last night and got nothing!
I'm having the same problem...suggestions anyone?!
My Charge 2 has stopped recording sleep intermittently. In the past, I was told it was because it wasn't recognising my heart rate, so I would have to reboot it. However, on these last occasions the heart rate was showing up but the fitbit won't record my sleep, which suggests it's an issue on their end, not mine. It has happened twice in the last 2/3 weeks. Unfortunately I have seen too many people complaining of the same, so I wonder if anyone has had any replies from actual fitbit. Thanks!
Have vaguely heard of this - via the NHS or private ? Can you suggest any ? Any internet resources to recommend ?99% of my Fitbit sleep readings are the same as this - Thank you
I do not think you have to wear the fitbit too tight..that is more of a preference..I know they have smaller sizes if you need it.  I would not wear your fitbit too loose because you could catch it on something and lose it.
My resting heart rate is 85 bpm, I have read that the normal resting rate is between 60 and 100 but the nearer 60 the better
Yeah, I went through every step they said, I still have to tell mine I go to sleep every night and wake up every morning.  Very inconvenient, especially since that was one of the reasons I decided to splurg on the Surge.  What a mistake.....I should have just gotten the Charge HR and saved myself $100.....
Hello @TomB29, welcome to the Community Forums! Thank you for the information and for the troubleshooting steps you've followed prior to posting!
 
You must see sleep stages to see a sleep score. For more information, see What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
If you sometimes don't see the sleep stages, please consider the following: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

On a side note, it may take a few minutes for your sleep score to appear after you sync your Fitbit device. 
 
Keep me posted.

Yes!  I have been tracking my sleep everyday since buying this Charge HR.  Today, the app was showing me the same and then synced, now it is no longer showing anything to do with sleep, all my previous month has disappeared and the Dashboard entry has just vanished.  Same for the Dashboard in a web browser.  Hey FItBit, where has my sleep data gone, and how do I get it back?  Reading other posts it says to enter it manually, really???  I don't remember the details of every day for the past month, that's what I expect the app to do, store my data for me, not lose it.  Sleep data was main reason for buying this, so I need it back!!!
I have set the alarm twice and it isnt vibrating or lighting up. I also thought it would vibrate today when I had done 20% of my steps. I only got it yesterday, should it be vibrating more?
Fitbit rarely mentions an impending update until it starts rolling out. Sometimes 3 parties find out and they mention it. Otherwise, keep an eye on the pinned posts or Blog.fitbit.com
Here is what Fitbit’s press release says: Coming soon to all Fitbit smartwatches, smart wake uses machine learning to wake you during an optimal time of your sleep cycle while in light or REM sleep, based on a pre-selected 30-minute interval, so you wake up feeling more refreshed. 6 The footnote "6" says: Smart wake coming soon; available only on Fitbit Ionic and Fitbit Versa family of smartwatches.

For my Hashimoto’s I take thyroid hormone. I have talked to my doctor aboutthe ongoing fatigue before. It is a major symptom of the disease but withmedication my thyroid levels are made normal. So no one seems to think itshould really continue causing me fatigue. I have had my doubts. My bodymight be trying to go into attack mode on my thyroid at night or something,though my regular blood work indicates that, in theory, my thyroid shouldnot be very active because it is not having to make the hormone that I amtaking in pill form. The thyroid being less active should make my bodyattack it less. Thank you so much for replying. If I may pry, are youhaving a flare with your autoimmune disease when your nighttime heart rateis above resting? Any thoughts on why it elevates at night rather thanthrough the day? Thanks again for your time!
Salve a tutti, io possiedo, ormai da qualche mese, un fitbit inspire HR che fino adesso non mi ha dato nessun tipo di problema.Da qualche periodo, per la precisione due settimane, non riesce a rivelarmi le ore di sonno. In alcuni casi sembra che non abbia abbastanza dati per creare il grafico in altri casi, molto sporadicamente, non mi da' nessun tipo di messaggio.Prima di scrivere nella community ho provato le varie tecniche di ripristino del device che però purtroppo non hanno portato a nessun risultato. Se può essere da aiuto ho notato che secondo il mio fitbit ho dei battiti medi a riposo che sono più alti dei battiti che ho visualizzato nei periodo di riposo durante la giornata.Può influire una errato calcolo della media dei battiti sulle rilevazione delle ore di sonno?Avete qualche idea per risolvere il problema? Concludo dicendo che ho dovuto cambiare il mio primo fitbit alta per una serie di problemi al display che era ricorrente, una prima sostituzione in garanzia e alla seconda volta che si è presentato il problema ho deciso di fare un upgrade del modello. Sinceramente specie di non avere altre delusioni.  Grazie in anticipo
I have the same issue, the instructions say use the hand you write and eat with. Well I write with my right but eat with my left. I have it on my left hand and picked non dominant. I will see how it goes both ways I guess.
Burgandy actually said that she puts it beside her ON the bed while sleeping.  Sleepy.
_dt.  Bottom line, how does the report stack up to how you actually feel?  Try it in both sensitive and normal modes.  If normal says 97% and you feel like a zombie, go back to sensitive.  If sensitive says 29% and you feel like you had a great nights sleep, then vice versa.  I have issues with my cervical spine, RLS, Sleep Apnea, Reflux, and shoulders.  I don't sleep well.  Sensitive says most nights I'm between mid-30s to mid-50s.  This tracks with me always wanting not get up in the morning because I feel like c....!!.  If you sleep with a partner, you might want to try switching arms and letting the program know, just in case your partner is accidently brushing your device. Oh, BTW.  Your post says "First night sleep time".  Don't base anything on one reading.  Run your findings for a week or a month to see how it goes, then compare how you feel with what the devices is saying.
When does he need the data by?
I have the charge HR so I do not have to put it in sleep mode. It is not the bad, I clicked on something in the dashboard and that entire section disappared. I found my old sleep data in my activities log but no way to get it back to sleep log

Hi FaithWrxThanks for replying to my post and although I'm sorry to hear you have thesame problem, I'm slightly relieved I'm not the only one. I was thinking ofupgrading to Premium because of it but certainly won't now I know that doingso doesn't resolve the issue.I did get a couple of replies back from Fitbit as I emailed them separately.I've not had the time today to read through them properly. As soon as I doI'll be in touch again to let you know what they say and if they've offereda solution.Fingers crossed...StuartSent from Stuart's PC

Hi Dbesh2 How are you doing now? I was diagnosed with PLMD in August. I am taking mirapex too and am sleeping better. Would like to hear if it’s still working for you two years later. 🤞😉
@Guy_  True but sleep goal is only 50% of the score. Deep and REM is 25% and Restoration is the other 25%. But I see what you mean. Someone can try to artificially inflate their scores by lowering the goal and still get the same sleep, like if I went from 7 hours to 6. That's on them then.
If you've every taken a yoga class, what is the best part of it to you? For me, its at the end when I find the right relaxation position and where I feel so relaxed that I could fall asleep. Once I actually did. Well, at night, whenever I feel restless and I know I've been up all day and need sleep, I go back to my yoga class and incorporate what I do in that class to get relaxed and that is to BREATHE. Okay so specifically, if you find your mind racing or maybe have restless leg, BREATHE deep. First find a nice position. I like to be on my back with maybe a nice rolled pillow or towel under my knees with my hands by my side. Then close my eyes and BREATHE 10 slow breathes where you breathe in your nose and out your mouth and where you can hear your breath coming out but not loudly.Then after that last 10th breathing intervals, my confident thoughts are that you should be more rested or on your way to sleep.
Hello, I have a wacky chronic illness the exact details of which are unimportant. What is important is that my life would *greatly benefit* from being able to be woken from sleep if my body temperature spikes above a certain level. Somebody I know suggested that a fitbit might be capable of doing something like this, and after a quick search I have found some information about the skin temperature tracking feature, but I haven't been able to find anything that explicitly suggests I could configure it to alarm if a certain temperature is reached.So, 1: Is this something a fitbit could be configured to do out-of-the box?and 2: If it doesn't have such a feature out-of-the box, how about for somebody with substantial software development experience? I see a "developers" subforum on this forum which gives me some hope that there might be a way to mod the device or write an application for it?Thanks in advance for the help.

Hi New to FB and this forum. I've had a Charge HR for week now, mainly to monitor my sleep. As expected it tells me 3 - 4 hours a night. It's been like this for three years, I know it's not enough as am always tired, grumpy, can't concentrate and have almost no short term memory any more. I 'should' sleep really well as:I don't have a paricularly stressful job or family lifeI'm not overweightDon't smokeGenerally avoid alcohol during the week.Don't drink coffee after noonGo to bed / get up more or less same time every dayNot on any drugsHave no health issuesHave a gluten free dietCycle to work thus do an hour exercise every week day.Have been tested for sleep apnea (they say I don't have it)Have a comfy bed, dark room, live in a quiet location, don't read a tablet etc in bed at night.So the list goes on and on, I should be a champion sleeper. I tend to go out like a light but then wake and be restless all night. Even if I take Zopilone pills I still wake and really don't sleep much better (I do not take them regularly) Any ideas?
It's always been a problem for me, the more water I drink the worse it gets. I have always consumed an enormous amount of water each day. Actually I am accustomed to it. 😩

Hi @SavannahS1 I have heard the following tips: Stop looking at screens at least 1 hour before bed, stick to the same bedtime (even on weekends), avoid eating and exercise close to bedtime, reduce/eliminate caffeine (especially in the evenings), exercise regularlyPersonally, I have found that Melatonin, chamomile and lemon balm help.
As you all go to sleep, I wish you sweet dreams and sound sleep as God showers his blessings on you. With stars glowing your dreams.Before you sleep, thank God for the beautiful day he gifted you and hope for another amazing morning when you get up. Have a peaceful sleep. Good night and sweet dreams.I wish you good night my friend. Sleep well.
Hi, I am looking to find out how many times I was awake on the app. I am not looking for awake time as I know how to find that. I want to see how many times I was awake without having to try and count all the little red lines. Thanks!
There should be no harm in lending your FB to your friend.  Just make note of the date and direct your friend to "that night" for their sleep results.  More "lent" nights will confirm what your friend may be feeling / lacking in sleep for the next day.  First make sure your sleep data is correctly registering for your profile.  Good luck.

Thanks for taking a break from stepping and for sharing the issue you're having with your Fitbit. I don't think this is related to Premium at all. If you already restarted your Fitbit, please feel free to write to our support team. They might have to check what is happening with your Fitbit.
 
Hope this helps.

Following this post' [Re: Which FitBit device is good for tracking sleep - Fitbit Community] @FehA  said "shows exactly the amount of sleep you get every night, plus how long you're awake  tossing & turning, amount of your sleep is light, deep & REM & what percentage of sleep score you get & whether it's poor  fair, good or excellent" is it true that the fit bit versa is the only fit bit that does this? It is advertized here on fitbit website but doesn't seem to mention about details about sleep here [Fitbit Versa 2 Smartwatch | Shop] I can show example of reading on fit bit inspire I have It gives details such as amount of short periods of time woken up "08 :32
@hikinhottiewrote:Do you deduct the minutes awake from your total sleep time? Hi @hikinhottie, I do subtract the awake time, but that's just a personal preference because I'm trying to focus on deep sleep and REM.

I love the message notification when I'm up but not when I'm sleeping.  Does anyone know how to put the message notification to sleep?  I stopped wearing my fit bit due to it wakes me up with its vibration when people message me at early morning hours.

Thank you, that answered my question.
@Runner0621 I usually get good, reliable sleep data. I do find that, whenever I start using a new device, it will take a couple of nights to figure out how to wear it at night. I'm not comfortable if it's too tight, but if it's too loose it won't be able to read my heart rate. It can take a while to get that worked out, but then I'm good for a long time.

Hi @Piandro - Interesting post! Let me add one more suggestion - it’s “out of the box,” but whatever works, right?  I’ve found that if I can’t turn my brain off and meditation does not work (it normally does), I turn my iPad to night mode (to reduce the blue light) and take it offline. Then, I play solitaire at breakneck speed until I cannot keep my eyes open. The speed of play is critical. It forces all other thought out.

I have read that sleep occurs in cycles but what if your cycles don't always occur in the proper order? For example last night I went from being wide awake to being in a deep sleep. I don't think this is just a Fitbit reading issue and here is why
 
I was being tested some years ago for Epilepsy (which I didn't end up having) and I had to wear an EKG around with me as well as an EEG (at one point I wore an EEG for 5 strait days). The tests showed that I was asleep when I was awake/along with other wonky sleeping patterns and my heart rate dropped very low at times (not sure what my bpm was but low enough that I have been tested for Bradycardia more than once). No heart defects were found so it was assumed my Bradycardia was a result of exercise. MMRIs always normal. Once after giving birth I fell asleep hooked up to the blood pressure monitor and they rushed in with crash carts because my values were so low they thought I was dead but I could hold a conversation (they were startled to say the least). Sometimes when I exercise even intensely my heart rate is just chill and even throughout. I have literally hammered out an hour long kickboxing workout with BPM of 55, covered in sweat. As I get older my BPM seems to be more normal but I still seem to have something going on. I wanted to get my sleep professionally analyzed but the wait for that was over a year and my neurologist never put me on the list and now that I am no longer being investigated for Epilepsy I no longer have a neurologist and cannot request a sleep analysis (I don't live in the USA). Does this sound like a sleep disorder? Faulty wiring?
 
Btw I get loads of REM sleep but not much Deep Sleep for my age and I always wake up feeling tired. Sometimes my dreams are so intense and drawn out I wake up more exhausted than when I went to sleep in the first place! I go to bed at 9:43 pm and wake up 5:50 am most days sometimes I attempt to sleep in on the weekends but I struggle sleeping in and it leads to sleep paralysis. I can't stay awake later because I start to literally nod off and if I don't get enough sleep I hallucinate/become unstable so I really don't even bother trying to stay up late if I can help it. I have been diagnosed with severe ADD but what if it wasn't an attention issue, what if I was nodding off? I know I can partially sleep when doing reptitive things like eliptical, I don't really need to be full on so I can doze and keep moving. My mom seems to have problems too with insomnia, she goes to bed really early and then wakes super early.
 
Does anyone else have a similar issue and has been given a medical explanation? Or is also looking for answers? Or does this just seem like a variant of the norm? Is it just a low, rhytymic heart rate confusing sensors? Does anyone else have sleep disorders please share your story!
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
I can reconfirm that at the low end of HR detection the Charge HR definitely detects the onset of infection  This time I had the odd sneeze and blamed it on my dusty gardening (Summer here). But over a few days my RHR went from 58 to 64 and 2 days ago I woke with sore throat and temperature. Today the RHR  has already dropped to 62.@Runner88   Runner88wrote:Yes!

Yes! I had pneumonia for two weeks and noticed I had significantly increased time in the fat burn zone without working out. When I don't work out. I normally have very few minutes of fat burn. While sick, I had many days with an hour and a half of fat burn. Very interesting!
I was thinking about emailing them too as I don't like how its calculated now, but doesn't sound helpful from the response you got. 😕
Thank you for the reply.Good information. But does not quite answer whether it actually matters that I am getting less REM than perhaps I should be.I can see that having less deep and REM sleep might be a problem, but I am definitely getting plenty of deep, so does it really matter that I am losing REM for deep sleep.I have just switched the sensitivity of the sleep tracker on my Charge 2 and will note whether or not my percentages change as a result. Perhaps I am sleeping too deeply for normal sensitivity.Thanks again.
I have found that whenever I edit sleep start or wake up time the whole recording for the entire night changes. Light sleep, REM sleep, deep sleep, time awake, amount of sleep, everything changes, sometimes to a great extent. I (and others) have posted about this several times in various threads, but so far no one has offered an explanation for why this happens.
See How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?

@erikab wrote:I am 33 and have been pretty active at least 30 min of exercise daily. My average steps are14k.@erikab In medical circles a resting heart rate can be from 60-100. Here is a link from  the American Heart Org. Mine is typically 54-61 and depending on the temperature of the day or an onset of a cold or throat. We had some 100oF days and the RHR increased a point each day as the weather got hotter. I have found RHR accurate on the Charge HR and my Omron Blood pressure Monitor. is withing 1 beat.  My HR gets down to 41 while asleep. If you are concerned I would have your GP check you over. It's amazing how some simple observations trigger a series of events. I was having my annual series of blood tests the other day and we were talking Fitbit and heart blockers, I have a 1st degree heart blocker and is no concern but, surprise, surprise , the nurse who is in her mid thirties has a pacemaker because her Fitbit showed a very slow heart rate, like every 2.5 seconds and she has has a 2nd degree heart blocker.

Customer service mentioned there is no way to eliminate it at this time. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Health, more/less need for sleep, work time, etc. Should have an opt out option, even a toggle switch like they have for other items on the dashboard. Poor that this was added with no notice or feedback. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Good night!
I use the Fitbit One with the black velcro wrist band at night.  It seems to irritate me to the point of waking me up with a mental image of something wrong going on with my left arm. I have a mental problem with anything on my hands, arms, fingers etc to the point where I can't wear any rings, watches etc. I saw a fellow worker lose his finger due to his ring catching on a cabinet.

Wow, my Blaze now does the coolest in terms of tracking my sleep.  Deep sleep, light sleep, REM, awake.  Now i can totally see why i feel differently day to day, sleep is so key.  Great Job FitBit!!!
What is a healthy number of times to be awakened during the night?
normal settingaverage time in bed = 7 to 9 hoursaverage time asleep = 6 to 8 hoursaverage times awake = 7average times restless = 17sleep efficiency average = 80%Does anyone know what "normal" averages are for someone with the normal setting on fitbit? What should we strive to get? Also, does your partner moving in the bed effect your fitbit's movement at all?
"I can't tell you at what intensity or other movements but when your Flex indicates that you are moving so much that restful sleep would not be possible, your sleep graph will indicate that you were awake." You guys know what you programmed into your own device, so you should be able to tell us. What did you program into the device to make it think that a certain amount of movement is too much movement for restful sleep? Is that threshold arbitrary? Is it dervied from sleep studies? Why is this basic information not in the package or website?
Hi @SunsetRunner, it's nice to see you around and thanks for your great input! 😊
 
There is also another thread with information about the impact on Melatonin wearing a Fitbit device. Click here to go to that thread. 😁 You can also refer to our Fitbit blog for more information: Can a Pill Really Help You Sleep Tonight?
 
See you around.

Hi, I am completely new to the fitbit and I just started to track my sleep.As you can see in the image, the time labelled "restless" is almost the same everyday yet on Wednesday, my sleep efficiency is calculated to be 34% while it is at a 100% every other day.Can I know why is the log calculating it differently?? (I have read previous forum entries saying that it was an issue that was already solved.)Is there a difference in the actual "restlessness" or is it just a buggy dashboard. *Edit, + Should i be worried that I am moving too much during my sleep? (i am tracking using sensitive mode)Thank you.

Hi.. I have the same problem and I'm really concerned that no-one anywhere... not even in scientific journals seems to have any answers. In fact, no-one seems to even be talking about the issue. As soon as I fall asleep my heartrate starts climbing (around 20 bpm higher)  - usually for the first two hours of sleep. After that it comes down really really slowly and may eventually reach my daytime resting heartrate levels. My % below resting heartrate measure on the fitbit is usually around 4%.  I have done so much research and tried various supplements (magnesium, antioxidants) to see if I can nudge the dial, but nothing. The only thing I can't test/ try to influence myself is hormone levels, which I have a sneaky suspicion might be playing a role. Does your nightime resting heartrate follow your menstrual cycle? Ie does it fall at start of your period and then gradual go up and up throughout your cycle? Mine does... again.. changes about 10bpm over the month. I would really love to find an answer to this as I rarely feel rested when I wake up... even after sleeping 7-8 hours almost every night. If anyone has any clues.. please help!
The link does not work. I get a 404 error when I click it.
Hello @avapuckett19, welcome to the forums. 
 
I suggest you take a look at the following help article in our website: How do I set a bedtime reminder in the Fitbit app?. Here you find instructions on how to set up a bedtime reminder. This will help you go to bed earlier that usual, as you can personalize it.
 
If you have any other question or concenr, please let me know. Greetings!

So I've been using fitbit since more than 2 years now. Until Dec 2019, I was using charge 2 and I was pretty much satisfied with it. Even with versa 2, I didn't face much issues until lately I've been waking up every night and I wanted to check my sleep score and found out that my sleep score hasn't been calculated since the day I started wearing versa 2. I read somewhere to log out and log in the app but it didn't work out.

How does the sleep goal setting (in hours) affect the sleep score algorithm results? I have my sleep goal set for 7 hours, which is one hour less than the default 8 hour sleep goal.Given the same amount of sleep (deep and light), REM, and awakeness activity, will this goal setting increase my sleep score more than it would be if I had set the sleep goal to 8 or 9 hours?

I am a regular cinema goer. Occasionally I get a period of sleep recorded when I am the cinema. Take this week, I saw “The Favourite” and was recorded as being asleep for over one hour. Now I know this was not possible as I can recall the plot and actions very well. Is sleep recorded because I am in a dark comfortable environment, moving little and absorbed in the film? I now have a Charge 3 but I have experienced this with a previous Blaze.

I am hoping someone can help me with recent sleep problem I have been having. Looking at some recent sleep logs I cycle between wakefulness and light sleep without falling into deep sleep. This can happen for up to 3 hours before I eventually fall into proper uninterrupted sleep. This is not a problem of ‘being tired’, it’s as if my mind wakes my body back up. I can actually catch the moment as well where my brain realised I am falling to sleep and stops me from doing so. My heart rate increases and I have to start the process again. I already do all the basic sleep hygiene stuff, eat well, train six days per week etc so this is not something I have found a way to easily fix. It does not happen every night and has only recently come on. I have had some recent success with a complete caffeine ban. However I would love to know if anyone else has experienced this? If I could upload a screenshot I would show you what this looks like on my tracker.
Thanks!! It is because I guess forgot to use the go to sleep app one night! I will stop using that!!Sent from my iPhone
Well, isn’t that special!? I repeat - that’s "bait and switch" salesmanship. I don’t like being cheated, but what can we do, other than dumping fitbit, and passing the word.
@Nomes  Journals are good to have. I have a special pen when I write in mine. Sounds like you've made some positive changes in your life. Keep on doing it!

If you have a flex, I find that a ruler placed along the wrist under the clasp area so you have somethingfirm to push on instead of the Soft Tissue makes a huge difference.The constant pushing on that area causes Carpal Tunnel symptoms and serious Inflammation, this has been my own personal experience.I made an elastic sleeve for my flex and only wear the proper flex band for special occasions, I now also have a Charge HR [part a].
i used to have that problem. and just like learning roundhouse kicks, i solved it the same way: i just kept on doing it at the same time, and refused to take naps the rest of the day. i'd be so tired that it became easier to sleep at the time i wanted. i also had problems waking up too early, but i just kept on doing it, till my body adjusted.

I have the Charge 5 and am new to fitbits in general. I bought it because I wanted to start tracking my sleep.  After using it for a few weeks, it has a consistent issue which others may have come across and have some advice.  I am at the age where I get up 2-3 times a night to pee.  I have seen other posts and people indicate that their tracker is recording this time as restless sleep.   However, my fit bit stops recording.  So if I sleep from 9:30 - midnight, then get up to pee, then go back to bed, the fitbit is only recording the 2.5 hours for the entire night.  I make sure to mark Asleep and Wake Modes when I go to bed and get out of bed, but the time "asleep" from midnight until I wake at 6am has no data...  Anyone experience this or have advice?  ((Putting in Wake Mode and back to Sleep Mode every time I get up would be a pain, so hopefully we can avoid that))
Haven't got an answer but I have the same issue so maybe not a lemon - or maybe two lemons!
Saw this article at Daily Good website:  Matt Walker: Sleeping Enough to Be Truly Awake
I want to know what is the better sleep setting to use for my Fitbit blaze
There is a good amount of waking up (the larger red areas). Other than that, it doesn't look bad.  Of course you'll know if you're really sleeping or not. You may want to try the restless/awake sleep mode one night to compare. Just turn off the HR monitor during sleep (in the app settings), and you'll see the old style sleep breakdown.

Since you were asking about the breakdown, here it is (for my own sleep rated 91, your breakdown is likely different):  "Time asleep" accounts for 50% of the total, the remaining 50% being evenly split between " Deep and REM" and "Restoration". 46 + 23 + 22 = 91. To answer your question about reaching a score of 100: very unlikely IMO. You would have to score 50/50 on "Time asleep" and 25/25 on "Deep and REM" and 25/25 on "Restoration". I’ve never reached the maximum on even a single component. Getting 25/25 on restoration would probably require sleeping HR to be nearly 100% below RHR and hardly any restlessness. I think the best I’ve had on restoration is 23/25.

My sleep is no longer recording properly. I can no longer see the detailed sleep information on my charge 5.
@dingy  The vibration is short and not always noticeable for some people. You can check and see if your sleep was logged on your dashboard. If you were still in sleep mode or hadn't entered into sleep mode, there would be no record of it in today's log. We'll figure it out. Welcome to the forums.

Hello all,
 
I'm coming to Fitbit from Amazfit (which I've used for 3 years without any problems, only it doesn't offer REM sleep and I somehow feel Fitbit is better at least at registering data).
The problem with fitbit started since I've opened the app and went to sleep:
1) The main screen (the first bullet from those 4) is this 1-week score history which nobody cares about. There are 4 possible screens, make an options to set one of them as default. Each person is different, and for each person different stats are more important.
2) The second bullet shows some data, like daily, monthly, 3-month and yearly sleep duration. But that's duration only. You can include here beside sleep duration, the average REM, deep, light and awake times. 
3) The third bullet (speaking of different persons, it's the one I would make it MY "main screen") offers no information at all or I dont know how to access it. It also have a star on one of the days which I have no idea what it means. It shows only a graphic information on how did I slept over the last 6 days. And above it seems to be an average. This bullet (schedule) exactly like the 2nd bullet is, should offer a historic data view on weekly, monthly and yearly basis. (for example you could have a graph that shows 12 lines (one for each line) and if you select one it should show you average time asleep, average REM, deep, light, awake, average fell-asleep, average wake-up time. 
For this, maybe the best approach would be to combine the 2nd and 3rd bullet together.
4) The forth bullet also is a bit irrelevant (taking into account what I've wrote at 3). This should also be part of 2nd bullet.
 
On top of that, I've received an in-app notification shown in attached picture. Apparently I wake up on average at 9:01. I've searched within app (i didn't had premium back then), nothing. I joined premium (those 3 months - 100% not continue it) still nothing. So......does Fitbit calculate some statistics about me that they are not showing? 
 
I cannot fill in 4-5 feature request because the main idea would be lost, but is it possible that a moderator will take this post and check if as a whole or parts can be implemented?
 
I've also added some pictures of how Amazfit shows the statistics for reference (on request I can provide more)
 
Of course, another request (already filled in a feature request for that) is to make everything which is related to sleep free. For personal coach, yes, premium is ok, but not to hide new features added to sleep.
 
Any moderator would like to jump in and push this to fitbit devs?
 
Thanks!

Hi there I've found something in my fitbit app which i hadnt come across before. The Oxygen Variation when it comes to sleeping. Im not really sure how to use the information on there, there is a orange section that looks like a spike.                          Does that mean i have too much Oxygen in my blood or not enough, little confused as there aren't any value's to make sense of it If it matters, using a Charge 3 Thanks Phil.
The following link explains sleep tracking in some detail: http://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking You may not have been fully awake but just restless and moving your arm.
I get what you're saying. Honestly, the only reason I wear it at night is so I won't forget to put it on in the morning.  Some people have pretty lousy sleep. The sleep monitoring can help them see if there's something they need to address. I have actually read that it helped someome have some disorder diagnosed, but I can't remember the details. If you don't like wearing it when you sleep - take it off. It's not like seeing the results of 14 restless moments the next day will help you get fewer restless moments the next time you go to sleep.

Hey there, I used to wear my fitbit to bed but I soon realised that I was conscious of it, and I'd check it while I should have been sleeping! To put it bluntly, wearing the fitbit meant that I wasn't sleeping as well. I've never been a terribly good sleeper but I recently bought a "musical pillow" wihch has speakers in it. I've put together a relaxing "sleep" playlist and I often listen to it when I go to bed. It's almost as thought I've now trained myself to prepare for sleep when I play the music - I tend to relax and get ready for a good snooze. It has made the world of difference to me. Maybe you could consider doing the same? Just one tip, though - don't listen to your sleep music while driving! 🙂Den
Hi @Starr77 - you may wish to re-post in the Versa support forum and/or contact Fitbit's customer support.  It appears that this problem is being reported by others, so it could be a product glitch.  Also, I seem to recall that Fitbit has been reporting sleep tracking issues via red banners in this Community.

Currently, I'm on day #5 of wearing my Fitbit Flex and as a Nike FuelBand user still (one on each wrist), I am seeing the benefits of the Flex opposed to the FuelBand, encouraged more by the input I have to do, because it counts for something.  Nevertheless... ... the sleep patterns I have found in the first few nights does seem to reflect the way I can go through a night and I'm an avid user of melatonin or other sleep aids, mostly to get to sleep than anything else.  I stay fairly active through the week, biking to and from work, playing sports after work and running on the weekends.  More often than not, I do find that when I wake up in the morning, I always think that my body could feel better after a reasonable night's rest.  The first few nights with my Flex, I'm over 80% efficiency in my sleep patterns, where my mind feels pretty good, but my body doesn't feel rested. Has anyone else found a good way to get the body rested during sleep in a regular night's rest?
@Labinopper thanks so much for coming to the Community and posting your question - we are glad to see you here! 
 
When Fitbit users have sleep logs that look very similar to yours, we usually suggest that they go into their device settings to make sure their settings are on "Normal" not "Sensitive." Almost all of our users fall into the "Normal" category. Here's how to ensure that you have the Normal setting:
 
Go to fitbit.com, login, and click the gear icon in the upper right hand of the page. Click on your tracker. When on the Settings page, click on the tracker you wear to sleep.

 
Scroll down to the section called "Sleep Tracking" and if it's set to Sensitive, change it to Normal. Make sure to sync so that your tracker remembers this new setting!

 
Let me know if you have any questions, if it helps, or if it doesn't! 
 
& thanks to @USAF-Larry for the wonderful article!

HiI will give that a go. It is a weird concept I agree but wearing the charged fitbit hr certainly does trigger the dreaming.SSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
A lot of people say stay away from electronics before bed, try reading instead. I like to put on a movie, but turn the screen black and just listen to the dialogue. It has a similar effect on me like when I was little and my mom would read to me before bed. Just the casual talking tone. Because I am not actually working with my computer and the screen is black, can I keep going would this or would you recommend I stop. If I did stop, what about audiobooks with my phone? I need to lay my phone face down on my bed anyway for sleep tracking.
Don't you get a screen like this when you tap on the individual day?  Your sleep score is based on 100 points: 50 points for time asleep, 25 for Deep and REM, and 25 for Restoration.If you want to read more, see What's sleep score in the Fitbit app? 

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

Yes, @dragonpupps your solution works fine to me! Thank you! 🙂
Hi Feel free restarting the tracker: Restart the tracker URL: Click / Tap to open the Fitbit Help Article 'How do I restart the tracker?' Optionally check if sleep tracking is set to 'sensitive', if it's set to sensitive, change it to 'normal': Go to: URL: Click to go to the tracker settings * There's no save button but the setting will be saved. After the next sync, the new mode will be used.
Yes! I have been having issues ever since I switched to the tracker 2.the older, smaller version didn’t seem to bother me. I am sensitive to light when sleeping and the super bright green light that flashes with every movement was driving me crazy. I took it off a week ago and have slept better ever since.
Thanks!  I am new to this so I wasn't sure what happened!
Hey!I called the Fitbit customer support(1800 875 234)She directed me to restart my Fitbit, then change the sleep setting thingofrom "normal" to sensitive".. wait a couple of days to see if that works..If not, change it back to normal.. wait a couple of days to see if thatworks..and if still no luck, to call them back with my case number.They were pretty easy to deal with, and we'll see how helpful their advicewas lol.. maybe give them a try? Either way, I'll reply back here when Ifind out whether or not this has worked, and with whatever solution I(hopefully) find.Do you have any idea how to upload screenshots to this forum?When I click on "Insert/ Edit Image", it just has a "Source" file, butdragging or copy/ pasting a jpeg to that doesn't work..I'm replying to you now via email and have attached a screenshot of the"upload image" thing that I couldn't get to work.. if this screenshotworks, then I've just solved my own problem lol
Yes it does that once you sync it, then it adds a whole new line after the next time you sync your device. If you just sleep and don't sync it until you are officially up for the day then it will be one segment. If you sync it three times as you sleep through the night then it will be broken up into three segments. That is just how it is.

@WavyDavey Hi - I posted a screen shot of my data above. I've just bought my Fitbit 2 so I won't be buying the ionic until this one stops working. But if the Ionic does monitor O2 then that is a huge leap forward for wearables! It's really helpful to see the sleep charts of others for comparison. The more the better.
Thank you for your explanations @Nunul  When you wake up in the early hours, how are you feeling both mentally and physically?  I know you said frustrated, but are you exhausted or wide awake or buzzing or churning over the previous days issues or your to-do list for the next day or something else? Do you have a small bedside light (ie not the main light) that you can turn on to read a magasine or book or anything like that by? What sort of exercise do you do in the morning?  I walk our dog first thing in the morning and again at lunchtime then do sit-ups and leg-lifts immediately before I crawl into bed... it might not work for you, but just a brief, easy (non-strenuous) exercise session immediately before you clamber into bed might help? How long before you go to bed do you turn the computer and TV off?  If possible avoid *all* electrical things (other than your bedside radio) for at least half an hour before you go to bed in case it's that waking you up in the early hours too? Something I was recently told on here when I asked why I was more tired after more sleep was that having more than 8-9 hours sleep at night means you wake up mid-circadian cycle or something, so maybe still head to bed at 10pm, but aim to be awake and out of bed by 6-6.30am just to see if that helps you to not wake up in the early hours too?  Might not work for you, but it's been soooo accurate for me! 

	Amanda - a Fitbit Inspire user since 29th September 2019
My frustration is in looking at my time slept at 4:10am and it says I slept until 4:30am.  I was hoping it would be more accurate than that!
The Force HR is supposed to have auto sleep tracking, but my new Force HR is logging much shorter hours for when I actually sleep.  How does it decide when you're actually asleep?
Same Problem here. We created a Family and changed the Permissions. But found no way to see other Family Members Sleep Graph.
I would like to update that I am now getting good sleep stage results just about every night, with just an occasional night that I don't get them for whatever reason, maybe one night out of 45 days or so.  My only concern is that I don't seem to get very much deep sleep, but that is not the fault of the Fitbit.
@CobaltStargazer, is this an IQ test?  😛
This is way more work than before! Yes, we can find the information but I think what everyone is saying is we liked just being able to look at it- simply. Sleep score is meaningless to me! I get a 71 with 8.5 hours of sleep vs. 80 with 5.5 hrs of sleep.... what’s the point of that?!! I liked seeing hours of sleep, the score should be a feature people can choose or not.
Mine has changed also. I don't see anywhere the percentage of the quality of sleep. Sometimes these types of changes are very frustrating especially if you are trying to track your progress in certain ways. My "logging" screen for sleep looks totally different.
Start it at a consistent time when you won't forget to start it.  If you start it early, it will affect only the "you were in bed for X hours Y minutes" statement, but not the "Your sleep efficiency".  for example, identical twins doing identical things except, one starts his when he gets home from work at 6 pm, the other starts his when he intents to go to sleep at 10 pm.  Both fall asleep at 10:30 pm and wake up at 6 am.  Fitbit will log their "you were in bed for" time differently, but will ignore everything prior to 10:30 pm for both when calculating their sleep efficiency.  So, assuming that they were restless, awake, and asleep identically (twins... ) their sleep efficiency will be the same regardless of when they said they went to bed.
Same thing here: I've had a couple of months with no issues, then no sleep stage for the past week or so. Firgured it was a system bug so left the FB devs to it, but now it seems broken again. 😎
Hello everyone. I'm posting some results from my sleep on sensitive mode. Basicly I really don't have any problem sleeping and never has. I fall asleep within a few minutes from getting to bed and 99 of 100 nights don't wake up untill the alarm goes off. Some days I do have problem with feeling unrested when I wake up, but it could just be because I sometimes get to bed to late for actually getting the full sleep I need even if I sleep good. I usually spend 23-5.30 (6½ hrs) in bed on workdays, where I found 7-7½ hrs are what I actually need. These images below are from this weekend tough 🙂  What I've basicly understood the "awake" pattern is a bit misleeding, it's more of a "None REM Sleep" with movements of body and twiches. As I wrote before, it's very few nights I actually wake up to remember doing so. I hope this gives anyone a good insight on how the sleep patterns can look like.
Hi everyone!  I thought it would be fun if we could all share our sleep score from the previous night.  Keep this thread going and post as often as you can!  You can tell us what your sleep score is, how you feel about it, what time you went to bed and woke up, etc. I'll go first!  Last night, my sleep score was 87.  I fell asleep around 8:30pm and unfortunately was up around 4:45am thanks to my dog.  She is still not fully adjusted to the daylight savings time here in America, so she was ready for breakfast.   Now share yours!  🙂

Hi @Renee7376 & @JimJ502, Try this, and see if it gets sleep tracking back online: Go to the fitbit.com site, and click Dashboard. Then click Log, then Sleep. Enter the start and stop times for the last sleep that came through inaccurate. It will create a sleep log for that night, and hopefully get this back on track. Not certain if it will have an effect on sleep stage tracking, but you try and let us know!

Does anyone know how I can get my Fitbit to display sleep data in a left to right continuous sleep stages graph rather than vertical lines? I had the sleep stages graph when I first got the device then about 10 days ago it suddenly changed to vertical lines and I can't find a way of getting the graph back again.ThanksStuart
Have you set your Fitbit settings to "sensitive"? If it is at the normal setting, it may not detect gentle movement.
Thank you for your reply I’ve only my iPhone to send it with and the camera icon isn’t giving me the opportunity to go into my photo library. Sorry. Total noob

I'm 32 this year! My fitbit reflects this - sometimes I struggle to get to sleep but when I do, I don't wake AT ALL until my alarm goes.  It's HELL to get out of bed as well, even after 9-10 hours, to go to work. At weekends I can sleep 12-14hours, almost all day if I'm hungover!!  I've got a sunrise alarm clock, a nice wake up tune and a vibration from my fitbit and it's still HELL! I've tested my fitbit on my parents - they wake 4-5 times a night so I believe it's recording accurately.Is there something wrong with me?! If I don't wake up at all then does that mean I'm NOT lazy?  I don't have a hard physical job or anything.  I am on antidepressants tho.  (Citalapram). Any suggestions welcome!It is definately that medication! I sleep a lot as well so I had a sleep study that found I have narcolepsy. Before that I was on Citalapram because narcolepsy is often misdiagnosed as depression. That medication made me extra tired. I am not saying that there could be something else wrong with you, but the medication is definately one to make you feel so tired. After I fell asleep driving because I took the medication, I weened myself off of it and went back to the doctor to request a sleep study. There are some things to avoid such as caffeine and sugar before bed because these chemicals cause us to crash and feel more tired. Try to go to bed at the same time each night and get 8 hours of sleep. Avoid stimulants of any kind including TV and computers while in bed trying to go to sleep. That is what my doctor told me. If you do all of this and try to wake up at the same time each morning and you are still that tired, I would suggest talking to your doctor and get off of that medication. If that still does not work, you should get a sleep study. That is my advice.
The new sleep chart? is completely useless. When is it going to be finished? Can you go back to the useful chart until you get the new one fixed?
I've got the same problem was all fine until 3 days ago been using my fitbit for months
Thank you so much!
I have been drinking a lot of pop and coffee not been drinking water. It make my teeth ground. So I stop drinking them except pop on Fridays. I have Fitbit charge 5 for one year 4 months. My sleep score is fair to good. Well last night when I sleep my sleep score was 90 excellent!! I believe what happened this week.
I guess it could be that Sunday was actually Saturday and Today was Sundaywhich I viewed on Monday. I’ll have to check time zone settings.Thanks for responding🤗--I'm hiding my internet presence.You can too with Nord Virtual Private Network
Is the technology used for sleep tracking the same in Charge 2 compared to Alta HR?  Some sources indicate that the the Alta HR is more up-to-date regarding  sleep-tracking than the Charge 2? Is this so?

I have been using the charge 2 for a year and now i have gone to the Versa Light. I have never ever had a sleep score and a reading where it shows me rem or anything. Only shows a graph. How in the world do i get it to give me a score or the sleep stages that everyone talks about. My wife has my old charge 2 and from day 1 has got the score and stages..please help me if you canMark
HelenaFitbit......If you turn off the Green LED Lights in the evening dosen't it stop from reading your heart rate which will effect your heart rate average and also your sleep activity.  Shouldn't you just take the fitbit off then?
Hello Fitbit community, I need some lecturing on how to get a proper sleep,I could barely sleep at night n it affects my health real bad
Customer service mentioned there is no way to eliminate it at this time. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Health, more/less need for sleep, work time, etc. Should have an opt out option, even a toggle switch like they have for other items on the dashboard. Poor that this was added with no notice or feedback. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Night and always step up your day so that you can be healthy.
Hi, everybody. About 4 months ago, I experienced insomnia. I just couldn't sleep, although I exhausted myself both physically and psychologically. I honestly didn't know what to do. This made me angry because I was constantly tired and irritated due to lack of sleep. When I became very ill, I still decided to see a neurologist. I couldn't sleep because of a nervous system malfunction. The doctor advised me to take kratom capsules. After a few days of taking the medication, I was able to sleep for several hours. I ordered it on the site because you can't find it everywhere. I hope my experience will help you.
We've kept a fitbit on our father to monitor his heart rate while he is in hospice.   The bizarre thing is that it is not registering his sleeping pattern at all.  In fact, the dashboard has shown that he has not slept for the last 2 days.  Does anyone have know why that might be?
I have sleep apnoea and sleep with a CPAP machine.  My sleep percentage varies between 58 to 69% on Sensitive/Non Dominant.  I've  been fairly restless and dream a lot.  For me, I think this is a fairly good representation of my sleep. I always wake feeling very groggy and rarely refreshed.  After viewing the daily reports I see why.  I made the assumpution when I first bought the CPAP machine that I would magically sleep peacefully for 6 to 8 hours each night. Ha! Wrong.  I'm lucky if it's 3.5 to 4.5 hours per night.

Dr. Matthew walker (the sleep doctor) only recommends melatonin for jet lag for retiming sleep, its better to get in a healthy sleep routine before bed rather than medicate
I want to track my sleep hours.I noticed my fit bit was not tracking correctly.   I thought I would uninstall the app and reinstall.The fitbit app shows correctly on my computer, but it does not sleep tracking on the fitbit.How do I correct this?   Thanks.
Hi @Cappon , How are you feeling in the morning? If you feel relatively well-rested, I wouldn't put too much worry into Fitbit's numbers. It may be you just require less of those stages than other people. Always pay attention to what your body says. I put more stock in that then the tracking.How active are you, exercise-wise?

I am usually able to fall asleep fairly quickly, but at some points in the night I get restless and my mind starts going all over the place too. It have been monitoring my sleep efficiency rating and it was getting down into the high 60s on average (using the sensitive setting). I found myself so tired all day and needing to close my eyes in meetings or even while driving - so not good! I  recently started practicing mindful yoga before bed and it has helped me a ton. I am seeing my efficiency score up pretty consistently into the 80s. I feel so much better and getting the day without being tired.
I am also interested in the Versa 2 accuracy for SpO2.  My nightly values have varied much more than I would expect.  Two nights ago the range was 92%-95% and last night it was 97%-100%.  Over 12 nights of data, the minimum values are between 88% and 97%;  the averages are between 93% and 98%; the maximum values are between 95% and 100%.  My daytime SpO2 values with a finger pulse oximeter are consistently 96%-98%.
Blue lavender is a great way to get refreshed and aid with sleeping. I'll share recipes if anyone is interested 🙂

PeterSD, I agree. I realized recently that one way to help my sleep problems was take my Charge 2 Fitbit off at night and stash it in my drawer. So yes, that has helped. I have a Flex which I haven't used in a year. Maybe I should recharge that and use it just at night. But it would be nice if you could set the lights to stay off at night on the Charge 2.
I also don't get much deep sleep, usually just under the normal range. Typically deep sleep happens earlier at night, so if you are going to sleep too late or have insomnia before falling asleep, that could interrupt your deep sleep patterns.REM sleep tends to happen for most people later in the evening/early morning. Sometimes my REM/deep sleep cycles get mixed up because I think my body is compensating for not getting the deep sleep early on, then alternating sleep cycles more than most people early in the morning.With major insomnia earlier this year, I've tried taking tea, tinctures and other substances before bed. For me, I have allergies, so loratidine (antihistamine) actually was working the best.Diphenhydramine, Valerian/skullcap, and other substances helped me sleep but didn't improve my deep sleep ratios (sometimes even left me groggier in the mornings.)Typical advice would be: set an alarm to remind you when to go to bed, have some kind of relaxation technique/rituals before bed, drink tea or something relaxing (herbal tea like chamomile, mint), limit screen time, maybe read or something to quiet the mind. These have helped me fall asleep but haven't necessarily improved my deep sleep though. Sorry, that's pretty generic advice... good luck -_- zzz.
I just wanted to pass on that the new feature "Sleep Score" absolutely sucks. I have sleep Apnea and it's important to know at a glance my sleep patterns and hours documented for sleeping. Your new invented score makes it impossible to know the hours, rhythms and segments. It was a stupid idea and now I have no idea how many hours I've slept.
 
Stop trying to 'make it better' by introducing your own verbiage that is essentially worthless in order to make your service look cool.  I want practical, usable data and it seems your moving away from that for a more colorful language that makes your product less enjoyable or usable.
 
Moving the menus around, making one touch review of history and online tracks of activity harder to get to is just the degrading of your basic job which is to track my activity in the easiest way possible.  You'd think you hired Microsoft engineers because their job is to make Windows as unfriendly as can be with verbiage that requires taking classes, and just moving icons around to different sub-menus just to make it look "fresh". STOP IT, you're ruining something really great!  Let me set MY OWN methods of data read-out so I can go back to hours slept not your new stupid score.
 
I tried your live chat support, their answer "Alejo Ch: There are 2 versions of sleep score: free and paid. The paid version is part of Fitbit Premium. The free version isn't part of Fitbit Premium."  So what he is telling me that since I don't pay a monthly fee now you're making the data worthless?!  Thanks for turning into yet another slimey company only driven by money and not health as you started out to be.
 
Moderator edit: Subject for clarity.
This has been a bit of a torture for me, I wake every morning 7 days per week between 4-5am usually.  And when I wake that is me, no going back to sleep.   It doesn't matter if I go to bed at 9pm or 2am I will wake same time.
Hi @WilsonFitbit I'm not entirely sure but I'd say around 4 years, moving through various forms of sleep meditation and I still have the odd night when nothing is going to work and I get up for an hour or so and then try again

No i keep it on 24 hours unless charging it. I do tap it after laying down, although i am not sure why i have to do this. Than i put in my hours in the morning and it logs them. So really i want to know things: 1) what is the purpose of tapping it before going to sleep?2) why do i need to log my sleep hours, shouldn't it pick them up automatically when synced?thanks,ma
Most mornings I couldn't tell you if I slept well or not.  However, after noticing the fitbit every night for a couple of weeks I noticed a clear patten -  eating later in the evening caused me to be restless for the first hour or so after I fell asleep.   Changing my eating pattern slightly is giving me a more rested sleep - I wouldn't have noticed or made this change without the info from fitbit.  So, yes, perhaps for most wearers its not that useful to record sleep, but try it..... you might find it helpful.
My Charge 3 works fine when on days of and sleeping during the night but a soon as I return to work doing 6pm to 6am it does not register me sleeping during the day (roughly 9am to 5pm)
I also see a huge increase in restlessness when I eat wheat... Probably inflammation or s GI bleed from gluten sensitivity causing a dip in my ferritin levels. If I avoid wheat my Fitbit shows more actual sleep.
sounds useful, tnx for sharing
Hello, I have seen in many occasions that my sleep heart rate shows an unexpected pattern. In the beginning of the night just when I am falling asleep my heart rate is low but when I fall asleep goes up and after few hours goes down and stay down. If I am rested and in bed and my heart rate is going down I was expecting that after falling asleep it would stay down and go even lower until it stabilizes during the night (except in an even of dream/nightmare). But it shows many times same pattern, flat then mountain then drops down and stays flat. Other nights simple shows a more expected pattern of smooth downward slope until it stabilizes. I can share pictures of the pattern.Anyone can explain this? Probably quite normal but just unexpected to me.
Other than trying it out yourself, I don’t think there’s much advice to give. I personally love the pillow-top mattress. I think it’s firm but with some extra padding for a bit of cushiness. I also have a mattress protector on it so it adds a slight thickness to it. It’s much more comfortable than a mattress topper which what I had before too. I have no experience with a foam mattress but I once bought a foam pillow. I threw it out the next day. Kinked up my neck really bad. I can’t imagine a foam mattress being any more comfortable than that pillow. I think if you do try out some mattresses, try laying on it in the position you usually sleep in. If it were me, I would bring a pillow to really see how comfortable it is.
Mine is almost always over 100%.  I was wondering if anyone else noticed this about it thought.  I am a really good REM and Deep sleeper.  I remember my dreams and most of them are very active dreams.  On the mornings when I wake up and remember the dreams (multiple some nights), I know if I look at the resting heart rate calculator it will be at least 90% over.  I am wondering if there is a correlation between the active dreams and your heart rate being high.  I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea but my oxygen variation rarely shows a high variation.  Just curious if anyone else has had this observation or if there is any data out there that active dreams affect the resting heart rate.
I'm so jealous.
The Fitbit has helped my daughter's doctor to diagnose her circadian rhythem sleep disorder - Sighted Non-24. It is now helping us to manage her sleep schedule.  She has so many therapy and doctor appointments, as well as outdoor activities - but they have to run with her schedule or she will have severe behavioral problems. When I purchased the Fitbit for the sleep tracking, I was finally able to see when she was ready to sleep and when she was ready to wake. I now know that she is typically up during the day around the last 2 weeks of the month and up during the night in the first 2 weeks of the month...so we schedule everything then. It also helps me manage her school schedule (she's cyber schooled). Before the Fitbit, I was in the dark. I depend on the Fitbit to help me manage her life.
I also do not like sleep score.  I need to know what my average restful sleep duration is.  Fitbit, please at least provide an option to choose between the score and average duration.  Also, sleep should be added as an option in the GOALS.  SLEEP is my most important Goal rather than steps, distance, calories burned, active minutes or floors. My daily Goal is to get 6.5-7 hours restful sleep, most important than anything else!
Thanks. Just did it.
Does the sleep tracking technology differ between the fitbit versions that offer sleep stages? For example, is the Charge 3's technology somehow more advanced or better than that of the Alta HR or Inspire HR? Thanks!
I entered 6:00pm when it should have been AM.  I deleted it on my phone but cant change it on my computer.
@WilsonFitbit - you said: I've heard that people who have arthritis are often hesitant to exercise because they’re afraid of making their pain worse. However, regular exercise tends to decrease joint pain and help maintain joints’ range of motion. I totally agree! I have a bad knee and start every morning peddling on my under table elliptical. It loosens the knee and gets me ready to start the day.
True. I guess we all get confused. Hence the inconsolable blogger!
When I logged my sleep from 23:15 to 06:30, it showed 6 hours and 0 minutes sleep.When I changed my sleep from 23:15 to 06:45, it showed 5 hours and 58 minutes sleep.It is impossible to get less sleep in a longer period of time.
One of the biggest reasons I wanted a Fitbit was for the sleep tracker. For the first 3 or 4 days I had mine set to normal and I was seeing 80-95% efficencies with 25-40 minutes of restlessness. I noticed that according to the graph on the iPhone Fitbit App that I hadn't "awaken" at all even though I specifically remember opening my eyes a few times to move into a more comfortable position.  One night I set it to sensitive and I got a really low efficiency and only 4 hours of sleep. I didn't feel like I got such poor sleep, I actually felt really good when I woke up. That was the only time I had it on sensitive and I've been using normal ever since. As weird as it might sound, sometimes if you see that you have "poor sleep" according to a graph then you start to feel like you got poor sleep, even if you actually got great sleep. Our minds are very powerful that way. So I choose to use normal because it does show the amount of times I'm restless (which I know is true because I remember moving in the night but I fall back asleep quickly) and it says I get 7-8 hours of sleep a night which reflects how I feel each morning. I think the reason there are two settings is because everyone is different. For me, normal setting is better.
You definitely need heart rate enabled to get sleep stages, and to even get better sleep time.Without heart rate, it relies only on movement, which is less reliable than heart rate.

That's interesting Dunc. I hear you about the charge but have you tried a long charge, say overnight? I'm never convinced that charge indicators are terribly accurate.I found the help desk at Fitbit really helpful although you are held in a queue so patience is required. If a long charge doesn't cure it and you are happy that the strap isn't too slack I would give them a call.Sent from my iPhone
I spend most of the night sleeping on my back. You are right, @WilsonFitbit - it does help relieve knee pain. One added note ... I have arthritis on my toes and place an additional, soft, scrunchie pillow at my feet to give my toes extra warmth and support.  Does anyone else have any suggestions?
yes it's true and sad, some say it even feels like the covid itself. so you can be alright without any symptom but after you take it you start feeling some side effects.
@Alicat2104 Thanks for sharing this. I will definitely take a look at it, I really want to improve my sleep.

I have the Versa. I love it. It seems to be tracking my sleep accurately. It even has nailed down when i fall asleep and when I wake up.
Hi Gillybean, I was experiencing this problem as well. Drove me nuts! Two things I did that have corrected this:1) Let the Fitbit do it's job ... don't tell it that you are going to bed or waking up, it magically knows this! It's impossible to insure it syncs while its in this mode ... you break sync, no graph Really it works, for the most part. When you wake up, DO NOT take your Fitbit off, DO NOT go into your sleep log, yet ... Manually sync your Fitbit with your device (phone, PC, ..). let it sync .. once it syncs, check your graph ! Voila ! Before the second on this list, try this for a couple nights.2) there are two settings ... one: you can adjust the sensitivity, make it more or less sensitive .. may take a couple tries to figure out which works best for you, (the above may already correct your issue);and second is try changing hand dominance, I think this also helps if your steps are off.If this doesn't work, a reboot of your Fitbit or even more drastic a reset. Then follow the above. Hope this helps!
Ok, today is Thursday and my tracker already has my sleep record for Thursday night, how is that possible since I have not slept yet????

I have a full battery and still it will not show the old sleep patterns. I think this is Fitbit doing an unhelpful switch
Hi,I'm considering to buy one of Fitbit products for the purpose stated in the subject.So, is it possible for a Fitbit gadget to wake me up with a vibrating alarm after it has detected that I'm sleeping for, let's say 2 hours?If this functionality is not available out of the box, is it possible for me to implement it on my own using your APIs? (I'm a software engineer).Last question: which product do you recommend to buy? I don't need GPS or any other stuff, sleep tracking is the main purpose. Thank you very much, looking forward!

I've been using the fit bit for approx 3 months. My average nights sleep is 4 hours. Is it really even accurate? What's the difference to setting from normal to sensitive? My partner has told me several times to get rid of the watch.. appears I'm getting a little obsessed with sleep patterns. Intriguing though
I get 90% sleep and up on my flex.  I have always been really good at sleeping though.  I could easily qualify for the Olympics if it were a sport!  I have post nasal drip and dry mouth and I snore right on through them, but I have found that using "Forever Mints" during the day and even overnight really helps that problem along with a 24 hour allergy med.

@MilesAweigh wrote:My sleep efficiency is consistantly 96%.  However, I wake between 5 and 10 times each night.  I don't understand how the efficiency score is correct.The efficiency score is based on how many "minutes" you're awake given your overall sleep time. So in that case it's not necessarily always the best way to look at your data. You should look at your awake moments and your minutes awake/restless. Given that, 5-10 times is not bad. Usually I get 15-30 times awake moments and with that I get 88-92% efficiency. Keep in mind that these could be points of restlessness and not all are awake moments. At the end of the day both data pieces are important.
Are you saying that a healthy male wakes up with an erection every day? Really? So what's wrong with me if that is an exception rather than the norm???

Thanks for that.  I couldn't understand how I could wake so many times, and get 100% efficiency!     Shame that it has to be done each day.
Ah, OK. If you go into the app settings, you can turn heart rate to OFF before going to sleep. This will give you the old sleep information.

Now you see why the sleep default setting is set to normal, it is the setting normal people use. If you want to track every movement of your arm while sleeping yhen use sensitive.The only thing a Fitbit can monitor is movement,and add heart rate to the new ones.So it monitors these paramaters to determine how deep of a sleep your in.
Hi,Sorry for slow reply, I had been a bit busy yesterday.My problem somehow had fixed itself, not sure what happened maybe because I submitted a problem tickets? Not sure.And, I think this will help answer your question better than I could. 🙂https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Well/2-sleep-questions/m-p/4489008/highlight/true#M9479
Fitbit notes that an average normal person is actually awake 15% of their sleep cycle. So when a doctor tells you to get 8 hours of sleep per night they don’t mean sleep for 9.4 hours because 15% of your time is going to be deducted. It’s very clear in my opinion but the way Fitbit calculates sleep time is contrary to the way it’s used by the rest of the world.Sent from my iPhone
In the app, you can click the pencil icon under the sleep section, and edit the start and stop times to make it one continuous sleep period. However, when I've done that, it's had trouble with calculating the sleep score. I don't mind this, as I find having two separate sleep scores to be not that helpful (it doesn't calculate enough deep sleep for me as two scores).

I don't understand but the way Fitbit rolling out this feature is really confusing. IMHO, Fitbit has almost destroyed all its reputation with its way of advertising its SpO2 sensor since 2017. I'm afraid if Fitbit doesn't know anything about it in 2020 and correct its mistakes, its remaining reputation won't last too long...
The Sleep log hours are inaccurate on my Inspire 3 from the start.  The sleep start time is accurate and sleep data is fine, but it will miss the sleep data for the last few hours of sleep. I can add the sleep log manually and would show the sleep data correctly as a separate sleep log or I need to delete the error sleep log and add a new entry for the entire sleep period manually.  I have contacted the support team, who asked me to follow these steps, but still I get wrong sleep log hours. It is a frustrating upgrade from my old MI band 5 which gives accurate sleep log without any issues. 1. Change usage to non dominant hand.(sleep data is not the issue, it is the sleep log hours with sleep score) 2. Restart inspire 3. 3. Keep the device charged fully.4. Re-setup the inspire 3 on my phone. 5. Wait for and update to version 3.80 Fitbit app.6. Clear user data on inspire 3 device and re setup inspire 3. How can I solve this issue? Why is the Fitbit app dumb enough to not aggregate the sleep data?
Hello everyone! 😊
 
Were you able to fall asleep quickly last night? 
 
I had a hard time to fall asleep last night. In fact, I was watching TV around 8:00 PM and after that, I decided to drink a cup of coffee but I am not used to doing it at late times, then I decided to go to bed at 10:00 PM but I think it was until 11:30 PM that I was able to fall asleep. 😴 I believe it was due to caffeine. 
 
Since this called out my attention, I was reading some information and I found that coffee does not affect everyone in the same way. Some people can drink multiple cups and experience few effects, others may experience adverse affects after drinking a single cup of coffee. It says that some People who drink coffee before going to bed may have trouble falling asleep (which is my case) but some others will not have the same effect. 
 
With that being said, does coffee affect your Sleep? Is anyone here that would like to share their experience? 
 
In my case, I'll never drink a cup of coffee after 6:00 PM. 😅
 

 
Have a great day!

I didn't have a sleep study done because of the fit bit but the fit bit did support lack of restful sleep and why I was so tired. I never thought I had sleep apnea as I really didn't snore and am not considered over weight. However, after many years of complaining and switching doctors right away they were certain I had it due to jaw structure issues. I recently underwent double jaw surgery ( could not tolerate CPAP) to correct the imbalances and fit bit supports I am sleeping better. while not perfect it is less interrupted. Go talk to your doctor, before they do a sllep study they will likely ask you several questions regarding how tired you are. Although I only had moderate slleep apnea ( diagnosed from sleep study) my daytime fatigue was severe, many times I would have to close my eyes at red lights and dozed off at lunch at work if I was the only one in the office. Hope you get checked soon.
When I got my Charge HR, I hadn't even considered that it could be used to monitor sleep. And certainly hadn't given any thought at all to why you would want to. And like the OP, I at first found it a little uncomfortable to have something unaccustomed on my wrist as I settled down to sleep. After having the Charge HR for a few months, I'm increasingly aware of the value of sleep tracking as part of an overall fitness/lifestyle program. A doctor once told me: Diet; exercise; and sleep can be thought of as the three legs of a stool that supports health. Too much, too little, or the wrong kind of any of the three can cause serious problems. And I was not doing very well with sleep. Over the course of a lifetime I'd developed some bad habits when it came to sleep. Caffeine in the late evening hours; too many late night sessions in front of the computer screen; eating too late at night; etc. I  was averaging just over 4.5 hours a night; sometimes supplementing this with an accidental nap. Aware of the problem, I made a concerted effort to improve. Cut out caffeine in the evening. Set a pre-bed routine (contacts, teeth cleaning, etc.). Set a firm bed-time. Limit my screen-time. And most importantly - recognize that if I woke in the very early pre-dawn hours, that it was possible to get back to sleep. I'm now usually getting 6.5 pretty much uninterrupted hours a night. Short of my goal, but still a vast improvement over where I was a couple of months ago. My resting HR has declined, I feel better. And I no longer nod off on the couch unintentionally. I don't know that I'll monitor my sleep for the rest of my life. But as I work on improving my overall health and fitness - sleep monitoring is going to remain a big part of my plan.
Hi and thanks for your response. The thing I am confused about is it did record my sleep stages before I was separated from my Fitbit .Sent from my iPhone
I think my REM isn't being tracked because I'm turning on sleep tracking manually.  However, automatic tracking requires one hour of sleep before it can detect that the wearer is actually sleeping, correct?  Won't that mean it tracks one hour less?   Thanks! p.s. I have a Charge 3
Does it mean deprivation if your going into stage 3 SWS within 5 to 10 minutes of sleep onset or is that a good thing? How much is too much REM sleep? Sometimes, it's 30%.
Does anyone know anything about my subject and how to sleep so I can wake up refreshed?

Hi @newelljo Welcome to the forum. I'm sorry to hear you are having an issue tracking your sleep.If you are using a Charge 2, you can find the restart information in the Manual on page 28. If you are using a Charge 3, you can find the restart information in the Manual on page 52.  Fingers crossed that doesn't the trick for you. Let me know.

@dlraymer  Not everyone sleeps the same. I can't get my husband to wear a Flex to track his sleep, but I'm sure he sleeps more than he realizes. Will you be seeing a sleep specialist ? Hope you're doing well.

I just reread this thread and have a different observation... The OP noticed wider swings in his or her (I think "her") overnight O2 chart which coincided with her second COVID-19 vaccine.  On the surface, a very interesting observation.  So?  Glad you asked. At about the same time this thread was created, I too noticed a sudden change in my overnight O2 chart and was initially curious; here's the thing, I didn't get my COVID-19 vaccination shots until April, May, and November, and when I did, my overnight O2 chart remained virtually identical to what I had been seeing between January and April.  My take on this is Fitbit updated their software/firmware sometime in January which had more sensitive O2 tracking, and this is what caused the sudden change in overnight O2 readings. So, here's a question for the community, how many of y'all noticed a change in your overnight O2 readings in January, regardless of whether you'd been vaccinated or not?
I just thought I would share (if you haven't saw it already) an awesome tool that you can import your Fitbit sleep data into to create a graph - SleepGraph.com. I originally used Excel to graph my daughters circadian rhythm sleep disorder for her neurologist (I needed more than a screenshot from the app). I asked a question in the Fitbit community on how I could create a graph with the data, but that was the only answer. It took 3 days to create a graph with 2 month's worth of data.Excel:I then found on a Facebook group the SleepGraph.com site (the creator is a member). It took me 5 minutes to create a graph with  4 month's worth of data. Check it out. If you like it, please donate to him. As a recovering Excel refugee, I truly appreciated his work. SleepGraph.com
I dont sleep good as a whole especially after Lyme got into my brain. Significant damage there. It has made me more sensitive to things sounds etc. I have however re-trained my body so far to get at least 6 hours sleep that is not straight mind you but I am able to go back to sleep. Since I got the blaze however, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me at first. It happened over and over again whenever I wore it. Just wondering if anyone else has had this same issue?

Hi, @TimothyBourner! Unfortunately, all Fitbit devices (and really, all wrist-based devices) have the same limitation that there's a limited set of signals they can rely on to determine sleep. They're mostly looking at heart rate and motion. That's why most devices will also mistakenly think you're asleep if you're sitting really still and relaxed, too.

@Gstsaver I've used a Polar chest strap to measure HRV and found the numbers that I get from my Fitbit to be very different. That does make sense to me because they are different devices and they measure HRV differently.Most people consider the chest strap to be the gold standard for heartrate measurement and I agree with that. While my Fitbit doesn't agree with the chest strap in terms of absolute numbers, the overall trends do mirror one another. Based on that, I would suggest looking at how your HRV is changing over time and not put too much emphasis on a particular number on a given day.

That looks similar to mine. I've been wearing mine quite loosely and further up my arm. Going to try more tightly and nearer the wrist. I think it's probably not causing the problem though but just wanted to rule it out. I get really tired a lot of the time and think it's maybe because I'm not getting enough deep and REM sleep. I don't know what to do about it though!
Fitbit really fumbled the ball on this beta roll-out.  I'm not one to usually be so demanding, but they should open up more beta-testing spots, and soon.

I am using the Versa on my daughter to get sleep logs since she potentially has a circadian rhythm disorder called "Sighted Non-24" or "Hypernychthemeral Syndrome". I am using my android phone to monitor her, as well as the desktop website. If I check her sleeping activity on my phone, will the app think she's actually awake? Will it disrupt the logs and say that she is waking up and opening the app on my phone (which is me) when she is actually sleeping? I need to make sure her logs are accurate.

So, summing up, 100 is not achievable? Then why the sleep score is designed to set unrealistic standards that push users into anxiety and depression?

I wasn't really expecting a solution to my sleep problem I was just sharing my problem.. you just never know who reads this stuff.. 🙂
My score was only 70 last night. I woke up at 2 am and had trouble getting back to sleep. I have two young cats (7 months and 18 months old) and they were really active last night. In spite of that, I had an hour of deep sleep and almost 90 minutes of REM. I'm feeling pretty good today.

I bought a Versa 2 because the advertisements said it had the ability to wake you at an optimal time in your sleep cycle. How do I set this? I can't find it anywhere.

Thank you for your reply @sikorski! Are you having trouble to track your sleep every day, or it's just something that happens at times?  

Davide | Italian and English Community Moderator, FitbitTi invito a partecipare nelle nostre discussioni! Commenti
Apparently even though there is an option to add screenshots here it doesn't work either.
Yeah that sounds like not a very good nights sleep.   The funny thing it is so hard to know what is "normal" as we only know our own reality.   Until age 30 I had sleep apnea.  I was tired most days.  I went to canada to have my Uvula out and the difference was drastic and immediate.  I went from being an "8hour" sleeper to a 6 hour sleeper with way more energy.  The fact is what I thought was sleeping and restful really wasn't.  I had no idea how good an undisturbed night of sleep is.
Wore my fitbit to bed as usual but it didn't register any sleep or a score for Saturday night.  Worked fine Friday and Sunday night.  Is there a way to get that day's data back?
I have only worn my Charge HR for two nights and I was concerned about my lack of sleep even though the sleep efficiency was in the 90's. I'm not sure if it's just a matter of getting used to sleeping with it, but I am a "stomach sleeper" with an arm tucked under me  and I find the tracker to be very uncomfortable and find myself repositioning more than normal. I'm wondering if I should give it a few more nights to see if it's just an adjustment phase...but the idea of just having it on the bedside stand may be a better solution.
What an interesting thread! Now that sleep stages are available, I'd be interested in seeing what diagnosed narcoleptics are seeing now. I suspect based on my own (not diagnosed with narcolepsy) experiences that fitbit does overestimate what it calls deep sleep, and naps throughout the day usually seem to have an "onset" of either 1 or 6 minutes, which seems more like an artifact of the 5 minute HR sampling than an honest guess at when sleep commences.
I get that, but when I am looking at my results, I see red spikes and areas with no spikes.  During the "blue period" am I in deep sleep or REM sleep -- or can you not tell?   And if I am looking at the normal tracker (compared to the sensitive), I see fewer spikes -- are the ones filtered out the time when I am in less than deep sleep?  Maybe that's the REM sleep?
Mine does that too! My resting heart rate is usually about 54. When I sleep , it goes as low as 41! I’ve had a 24 hour holter monitor and I was told everything was normal. I have been working out for about 2 years now so I guess my heart is just in good shape? What did your cardiologist say??
I do mine on the phone app. Can't seem to get it right otherwise either.Good luck!
Tracking our sleep is the only answer why we are so grumpy when we wake up evert morning....Its because we have not enough sleep...
Oh and I forgot to add.... I have been the same way with my weight... I am so frustrated as I lost 90 pds years ago.  It wasn't easy as I found the only way I could do it was by eating 500-800 cals a day.  If I ate more than 1000-1200 I would gain.  People didn't believe me.  But it was true.  I thought well hell, it's menopause.  But noo.... now I don't believe so.
I have the same resting rate as you. I have something called postural orthostatic tachycardia which means my heart rate drastically changes depending on whether I'm sat or stood, in a hot room or outside, etc. Any simple change can trigger it to be honest!I'm not trying to scare you, just explaining the reason behind my numbers. If you get palpitations at all or feel dizzy, you need to get checked out by you gp.If you see my picture, my rate goes haywire just after the gap which is when I had a shower. The heat changing is the worst for me!A typical rest day for me.
This happens to me every night,  but it always calls  one the night  i slept and the other it calls today.  Stranger still, it seems like the two dont match.
I used to log my sleep by entering the <start time> and <end time> on the Sleep Log page, eg. "22:30 on previous day till 7:00 today".  But now the choice of <previous day/today> is no longer available on this page, so it is not possible to log sleep which starts on the previous day.  Why this change?  It is so frustrating!

Hello everyone. @Sonata @Slh114 Welcome to the Community Forums! 
 
The information given above is correct and the input is very appreciated. Currently, your sleep data is from last night and sync under "Today"
 
For example, if you went to sleep on Wednesday night, your day will end at 12 am. The most hours you sleep are from the next day, (in this case Thursday). For this reason, your sleep data will appear as "today" after you sync your device on Thursday in the morning. This is an expected behavior and it is applicable for each day. 
 
For information about sleep, please check: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
Keep me posted. 

	Wilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.
I think I had me tracker on sleep all day.  I pushed the button so the light would go on and I put it into sleep mode.  Didn't have time to check it the rest of the day till the next day.  16 hours of disturbed sleep.
It it works, please come back and mark the question as resolved.
I had the same problem yesterday, but it seems to be okay today. Will we get sleep stages retrospectively for yesterday??
Forgive me for replying to an old thread but I totally agree with you. I used to sleep through the night and I wanted to get a fitbit to track how much I was sleeping. Right after I got it, I started waking up at least 2x a night. This carried on for about 3 months. Eventually I thought "what if my fitbit is making me not sleep?" so I stopped sleeping with it and I haven't had the issue since. Here's why I think it happened: 1. I was over thinking about my sleep, thus making me anxious that I was going to wake up during the night. 2. Any form of electronics near your bedside isn't good for you. Period. It emits electromagnetic waves into the environment which isn't good your biological clock. WHO actually released a statement that ANY electronic device isn't good for your health and actually increases your chance of cancer!
I understand what your saying. You do get grumpy because your running on stress hormones. It becomes a viscous circle. Do you work shifts in your job. If so that would make sense.
I am a night owl, not by choice.  I would like to go to bed at a decent time so I set an alarm on my Fitbit.  I tend to relax and sleep better when I smell the scent of peppermint and Jasmine from a fragrant candle.  I might invest in a sleep mask.
My score last night was 82.  My dog woke me up at 3:30am to go to the bathroom and I struggled to fall back asleep afterwards.

I finally got it to work--apparently the forum doesn't like the Chrome browser. If your sleep pattern is like mine you might have sleep apnea.
Why does the time of going to bed bear no relation to real time? My tracker is telling me, for example, that I went to bed at 1:20am when in actual fact I went to bed at 10:50. It seems to get it wrong more often than right.
First step would be to tap on the offending sleep period. Now look below the graph and see what Fitbit says about seeing simple sleep.
@SleeperC - it’s possible to set a sleep schedule, but since sleep is automatically detected, you cannot tell it to ignore sleep between certain hours. As for the low heart rate, maybe that is all the more reason to get up and move more often? If it becomes a concern, you can always check with your doctor.
Hi @genericbrandhmn - Sorry you’re going thru this. You say you have followed all the suggestions offered in these community forums but, have you contacted Fitbit Support?  That should be your next step. To answer your question, “Does anyone actually have their sleep tracked?” - my answer is yes. I’ve had a Sense since it was first released and it tracks my sleep. That’s why you need to contact Support. They can process replacements for defective devices in case that’s what yours is.
It doesn't surprise me @Aurora17 this is a comunity forum, and like every other comunity forem, it is set up for the the comunity of Fitbit users to help each other out. While there are a few moderators around, they can not be in every thread. It is highly possible that none of the moderstors have actually read this thread, especially when none of them have been priperly mentioned. My guess is that it is periods of restless so small that the connecting line was not drawn. This is just a guess, im simply a fellow Fitbit user as you.
Hey thereI signed up just to answer you :).I'm  a healthy person i workout .I have a smart watch that measures my heart beat all the time.Most of the days when i don't workout my waking up heart rate is the highest. And it's higher than my regular resting or standing heart rate.I have been wondering about it and found your similar query.
Hello @SGHinDC Welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thanks for sharing your experience. Deep sleep typically occurs in the first few hours of sleep. Also, note that if you haven't moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you're asleep. Probably this is happening when you're watching TV but your experience is really interested.  
 
See you around.

Before I purchased my Fitbit tracker, I found myself exhausted throughout the day as if I had no sleep at all. This was happening repeatedly even though I was making sure to allow eight hours of sleep each night. When I purchased the Fitbit, I found that although I was in bed for eight hours I was so restless I was only getting three to five hours of actual sleep each night; even though, like you, I had no trouble falling asleep initially. I should mention that I have long and very full work days with a long-distance commute each way so my mind is often on overdrive.  I decided to make a change to my evening ritual. I no longer watched TV or engaged in any other mental stimulation 30 minutes to an hour before bed. I learned some deep breathing techniques to relax and quiet my mind. I even took hot baths a couple of nights right before bed. I found I needed to have greater separation and distinction between my active working/thinking day and relaxed time for sleep. This worked for me within a week. By maintaining the new ritual I have been getting restful sleep every night. I hope this helps. 🙂
@djarz As your device is still in sleep mode, any movement will be recorded as restless sleep or awake. I imagine that during this time, the movement wasn't sufficiently vigorous to be categorized as awake. I'd recommend, if you're up for it, taking the device out of sleep mode for late-night urination activities. This is a technique that I use so that I may get as much credit for my steps as possible!

Someone told me about "sleep procrastination". That's when people who have a lot of stress and not much free time during the day stay up later than they should at night. This is because they want to have some time for themselves. I realized that I have done that for years, but I never knew there was a name for it. Now that I understand why I can never seem to get to bed as early as I should, this is something that I am trying to overcome.

Hello @NannyS @Slh114, welcome to the Community Forums! 
 
Can you please check that you're in the correct time zone? Your Fitbit device should sync the sleep data from last night. Meaning to say that the sleep data starts from yesterday night until today in the morning and it will be recorded as "Today" on the Fitbit App. 
 
To correct time zone, please do the following: 
 
1. In the Fitbit app, tap the Today tab > your profile picture > Advanced Settings.2. Turn off the Automatic time zone option.3. Tap Select time zone and select the correct time zone.4. Sync your Fitbit device.
 
I look forward to your reply.

Thanks for posting. Yeah, same here. It’s not accurate. While lower amounts may be “normal,“ it’s not healthy to have levels that low while sleeping. The heart rate is never 100% accurate either. It’s usually off by about 5 to 10% in my experience. I don’t mind that as much because in many cases one doesn’t really need an exact heart rate assessment. Oxygenation is much more acute, though, with a 5% oxygenation variation representing a much bigger difference than a 5% heart rate difference. What’s extra frustrating is that there seem to be only responses from other users and giving their opinions and sharing their experiences, but not Fitbit employees with product knowledge explaining the latest technical details to us an answer to these questions. While the former can be helpful, the latter is what’s really needed here. Anybody with me on this? Anyway, I hope we can get some answers. Not just opinion.
That looks like sleep apnea to me.  I have severe sleep apnea, so bad when I don't wear my CPAP my airway blocks every 45 seconds! Here's what my graph looked like (scroll to the bottom of my post) the last time I was unable to wear my CPAP to bed (which mercifully was over a year ago):https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Well/Better-sleep-amp-score-NOT-using-CPAP/m-p/4705118/highlig...
I keep hoping they'll make sleep sensitivity compatible with the sleep stages. I understand that the stages are supposed to take the place of the sensitivity but I know I am awake significantly more than it reads me as being (I'll be conscious and alert but it will just read it as "light" sleep). It seems their previous setup was much better for accurately registering sleep/awake times for my sleep disorder than this new system.
The same thing happened to me.  I went to the Discover - Heath & Fitness Stats and can see the Sleep icon but it will not let me add it.  Very unhappy.
 
I agree.  I would like a response as well from the company.  I use this mainly to track my sleep.  
 
I did this and the add option is not available.

Hi, I upgraded from Flex 2 to Charge 3 for its greater sleep management tools. But I am having trouble reconciling my stats from Flex 2 with Charge 3. For some reason the number of awake minutes are much greater for Charge 3. As an experiment I wore both Flex 2 and Charge 3 together for one night. My Flex 2 recorded 7 hrs 52 minutes of sleep with only 9 minutes of awake/restless time. My Charge 3 recorded 6 hrs 50 minutes of sleep with 1 hr 22 minutes of awake time. Don't minutes of awake time mean the same thing for both Flex 2 and Charge 3?

I get 90% on the standard sleep setting but only about 40% on sensitive.  Typically only about 3 hours of restful sleep as they define it. What's very odd is that sometimes I wake up and grab my phone and read for a bit before turning off sleep mode.  The activity of moving with my phone wasn't enough to register as restless which shocked me.
@Josh.FI tried Lexapro briefly and then quit due to the sexual side effects. In researching the drug, I found that difficulty sleeping was also a possible side effect.  Have you tried an alternative SSRI?  An alternative to meds?  We are all different and may respond in different ways to the same med, vitamin or supplement.   Another thing, I have quit wearing my FitBit at night.  Thinking it might have been causing anxiety on some level. How am I going to sleep tonight??  What's my sleep score going to be???  My scores indicated I was flunking sleep. (That's a joke, but they weren't good.)   A multitude of factors involved in sleep quality.  A lot of good suggestions on the forum.  Final thought, I have read that it is the man who thinks "I have got to get a good night's sleep tonight" who is going to lie awake all night. Forgetabout the stats, find out what helps you and sleep well. Peace.
@WilsonFitbit - I only wear the wool brace at night when I tend not to move as much. Part of my knee issue is permanent nerve damage which makes the area ultra sensitive to touch and wearing brace while walking would just aggravate things. But I don’t see why it could not be worn during workouts. It would depend on your purpose. Are you seeking warmth (wool brace) or support? For support, I’d go with a tighter brace.
I am a new fitbit user as well. I am pressing the button twice at night, and in the morning, without consistent success.  It is a hit and miss experience........I don't know if it is recording the correct movements until I sync the device.  I have been doing this 2 weeks, and have not figured it out yet.  I tried the wrist band, without the wrist band, holding the button for a longer period of time, 2 quick presses on the button.....if I find the lucky combination, I'll post.  I am frustrated.
Nvm found answer for those who also need help ill give you a quote and a link to help you 🙂There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stagesIf you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your device’s battery is critically low.
Very good thread about restless nights. I'm going to try the magnesium.
While sleeping with the AC on is definitely more comfortable for some people, it can also remove some of the moisture from the air. That doesn't work for me. It slightly harder for me to breathe throughout the night, leaving me stuffy or sore in the morning.🤕

Hi @LadyJD - Did you notice if it said something like - Wear your device to bed for three days?  In order to report on your SPo2, the Sense needs to determine a baseline. For me, it took 3 nights of wearing it to bed before the SPo2 showed up. Please try that and get back to us next week.
I just posted nearly the same over here: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Better/Sleep-score-and-stages-disappeared/m-p/4285834#M9112
Thanks for your reply, @DaviddeFitbit. I wear an Alta HR, which is comfortable. The problem isn't the comfort; it's knowing that I'll get a "poor" or "fair" reading plus a reminder to "get more sleep" the next night when I'm having insomnia. (Thanks a lot, Alta HR!) 🙂 When it needs charging, I chose to do it at night to avoid losing out on my step or active minutes count.
Nice to see you around Fitbit users! 
 
Challenges are always fun so I definetly will vote for this feature. It would be very interesting to see how people respond when they are challenged to get a better sleep; as at the end of the day, it's not the quantity of your sleep that helps your body to rest but the quality of it. 
 
I'm pretty interested in developing a better sleep ritual, I've heard that a lot of people do an evening walk before sleeping, some others read or drink a warm glass of milk as thats helps too. 
 
I’ll see you around the Community! 😄

One more thing. In a comprehensive lab test, my doctor tells me I am deficient in melatonin. I also suspect cortisol might play a role too. Not sure.
It doesnt always seem correct.   I used the sensitive mode and it tells me that I am awake very frequently slike almost 19 times in a night, which shaves off some two hours of sleep sometimes.   Is this really correct ?
When it doesn't work, just go ahead and log it on the sleep log page.
Not sure if this is just Premium, but on phone app under Sleep, tap the 'Deep and REM Tile'.  There is a Benchmark tab showing typical ranges for you age and sex in each sleep type. I don't think anyone gets 50% deep sleep; not me for sure.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I have found that setting my sleep sensitivity in the sleep settings to "normal" rather than "sensitive" my sleep activity is more accurate. On "sensitive" it says I get about 3-4 hours sleep but on "normal" setting it's 6-7. Mine does track light sleep, deep sleep, REM etc. now but not all the time.
My sleep only shows up on my phone. There is no tile on my actual watch to let me check my sleep time.
Cant retrieve my sleep pattern.. Check marks appear and won't let me know what itis.  This is new.
Hi @GardenerMichele, I actually do the opposite. That is, if I'm awake one hour per night, I'll bump up my target to 9 hours, giving me 8 hours of quality sleep. But there's no reason you can't do it the way you propose.

Your story hooked me because I have faced such problems, too. I thought it was the end of life, and I would never get over it all.
Hey me too!  I noticed this in 2016 when I got my new fit bit hr and was so scared.  I was just sitting there and was in the 40's!  I got so scared I couldn't eat and was a new mom so that was bad timing.  I don't work out...we do have heart disease in the family, but I am 33 and got all the tests and holter monitors so everything checked out ok!  I was told I am healthy and some hrs run low.  I noticed I can raise it to a comfortable rate when I have a glass of wine, or anything with alcohol.  I have been having one glass of red wine each night and it at least stays mid 40s to 50s now.  It also takes the anxiety off of wondering if I'll never wake up lol sounds stupid but it's real.  I found out I have a chiari malformation and read that can make your hr low as well.  So glad now that new people are using the fitbit hr like you now I see newer posts that are similar!  Makes me feel better!  I researched this forever lol.  Hope all is well!!
I've been sleep tracking everyday since I started using my Sense end of December 2021. Prior to that I was using my Wear OS Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle with the app Sleep As Android for about 2.5 years. I think it did well in tracking, although I never saw a comparison with an EEG like I have with the Sense. But my sleep score wasn't very helpful, was on a scale out of 5. Sense sleep tracking, especially with the premium, is definitely more helpful and informative and I think the score correlates well with how I felt about my sleep. I've been averaging low 80s per week which I would say isn't too bad considering we've had a <1 year old baby sleeping in a our room. 🙂
I have thought the same thing, although I have only had my tracker set at "sensitive" I am only getting 4 to 5 hours of sleep.  I set it to sensitive because I have been having trouble sleeping and I wanted to know just how bad it really was.  Now that you have shown that the different settings can give different readings I am going to reset it to " normal" and see what I get.  I know I'M not getting enough sleep at night and I'M not a day sleeper, sooooooo.  I'll let you know if my sleep changes like yours did, when you reset your Fitbit to "normal".  ****** Merry Christmas ******
@Sarah91 Sleep Mode can be started or stopped by holding down the button on your One. Check this article for more information on using the sleep tracker.
That's totally true @SunsetRunner, I need to make a big change on my sleep patterns, it's not very nice having to be woken up by an alarm everyday.

RHR still different than before Sleep Stage updates.  You can see the 51-52 flatline when starting in the middle of the chart.   Is this correct?
@Tatarmater wrote:My sleep tracking time is being weird. I once went to bed at 9:33 PM and woke up at 4;55 AM, and it said that I got 7 hours 7 minutes of sleep. Anyone else finding that problem?So, elapse time by my math is 7 hours and 22 minutes; did I get that correct?  If so then subtract a few minutes drifting off to sleep, a few more minutes for rolling around and/or getting up in the middle of the night for a quick trip to the bathroom, and there is your 7:07.
I have been told by my doctor that you should make sure you turn off your electronic devices 1 hour before bed so your mind can slow down.  I also drink camomile tea, which seems to help.  Another suggestion is to do deep breathing exercises to slow down your body to prepare for sleep.
I am new to fitbit and this forum, but I was diagnosed with sleep apnea about 13 years ago.  I finally got a sleep study done and was recommended to use a CPAP.  Ever since I got my 1st CPAP I have not slept at night without it. (on my second machine) Even after loosing 110lbs in the last year, I still use my machine.  If you think you have any kind of sleep disorder, talk to your family Dr. about it and if he suggests a sleep study, do it.  It could save your life and is usually covered by your health insurance.  I have personal experience with people who have died due to an uncorrected sleep condition.
Isnt sleep efficiency just actual sleep time divided by time in bed? So if each of your wakeups is only a bit less than two minutes each, which should add up to 40 minutes, if we assumed your actual sleep time is 7:30 which equals time bed is 8:10. Then 91% sleep efficiency should be about right.Or i might be completely wrong about how sleep efficiency is calculated.
I think there's a problem with the app. They said they're working on an update to fix it. I've had my Inspire 2 for 6 months and this is the first time this has happened. I'm sure they'll get it fixed.

I'm glad that you posted this here. I've started switching my Fitbit because I get red, dry patches on my skin for some reason (that didn't happen with my last Fitbit). I've noticed the same thing as you - when I wear it on my left wrist it shows that I'm much more restless than when I wear it on my right/dominant wrist.  Since it tracks movement, that tells me that I must move my left arm a lot when I sleep but not my right arm.  To me the tracking on the left is the more accurate - if I'm moving my arm a lot I'm probably not sleeping that deeply, no matter which wrist the Fitbit is on.

I have the Shawn Stevenson book at home but not read it yet, never have time for reading despite my best intentions. I use an app called Calm that has sleep stories to help my drift off to sleep each night, also take ZMA to help me sleep. The main trouble I have is sharing a bed with someone who needs medication that makes them twitch and snore all night... I keep having to get up in the night to take myself into the spare room to try and get some sleep. The interrupted nights are hurting me. I feel better after reading this thread though, at least I know I'm not alone in my less than an hour of deep sleep each night.

In the app, one of the messages says that it's common to wake up more than a dozen times a night, but the periods are so brief that we don't remember them. If you're not feeling especially tired, I wouldn't give it a second thought.

Hi Fitbitters, I was wondering how many of us manage to get 8+ hours of sleep?
 
Once you have a nightly goal based on the hours of sleep that you need, it’s time to start planning for how to make that a reality.
 
Start by making sleep a priority in your schedule. This means budgeting for the hours you need so that work or social activities don’t trade off with sleep. While cutting sleep short may be tempting in the moment, it doesn’t pay off because sleep is essential to being at your best both mentally and physically.
 
Let's try improving our sleep hygiene, which includes your bedroom setting and sleep-related habits, is an established way to get better rest. Examples of sleep hygiene improvements include:
 

Sticking to the same sleep schedule every day, even on weekends (😓).
Practicing a relaxing pre-bed routine to make it easier to fall asleep quickly.
Choosing a mattress that is supportive and comfortable and outfitting it with quality pillows and bedding.
Minimizing potential disruptions from light and sound while optimizing your bedroom temperature and aroma.
Disconnecting from electronic devices like mobile phones and laptops for a half-hour or more before bed.
Carefully monitoring your intake of caffeine and alcohol and trying to avoid consuming them in the hours before bed.

 
If you’re a parent, many of the same tips apply to help children and teen get the recommended amount of sleep that they need for kids their age. Pointers for parents can help with teens, specifically, who face a number of unique sleep challenges.
 
Getting more sleep is a key part of the equation, but remember that it’s not just about sleep quantity. Quality sleep matters, too, and it’s possible to get the hours that you need but not feel refreshed because your sleep is fragmented or non-restorative. Fortunately, improving sleep hygiene often boosts both the quantity and quality of your sleep.
 
Hope this info helps you to get a better sleep routine.

Moderator edit: subject for clarity
According to Fitbit's article here, it is normal to wake up briefly between 10-30 times each night. The source for that stat is based on a study done on EEG arousals. Now if my understanding is correct, scientifically arousals are counted as being under 30 seconds, with awakenings being more than 30 seconds. Fitbit's awakenings count 30 seconds or greater. So what I'm getting at is, it seems to me that there are inconsistencies in the science being presented here. In other words, I have to question whether it's really normal to have actual awakenings of 30+ seconds more than literally a few times per night. I've heard that it's normal after going through sleep cycles, but most people wouldn't be going through more than 6 or 7 of those per night.   Does what I'm saying make any sense?
A lower heart rate in sleep is normal, and I'm sure I read somewhere that the FitBit RHR is calculated using an average of both sleep and inactive daytime HR... actually yes, I found it - https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Charge-HR/How-does-Fitbit-calculate-Resting-Heart-Rate/m-p/1747633/h...

@Scop2017I have always used my Fitbits to compare my average sleep HR to the daily RHR because Fitbit put emphasis on ensuring you sleep, Fitbit quote "For best accuracy, wear your device to sleep", from this link.  I find Fitbit immediately calculates a new RHR a few minutes after I have woken and then occasionally during the day it will adjust that..  I average about 8 hours sleep for a 78 year person.  No naps during the day...  Here is the result of the last 30 days.

Yep, we're both snorers so ... one of us will go to our guest room from time to time.  It's a big help for good sleep.
That's correct, it uses your profile data such as age, gender, weight etc. There's more info on this here: https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/898903
I don't. I find it better if I don't wear to bed. I get a decent sleep without it.

Hi @Chardy19,The benchmarks aren't numbers from Fitbit, but from sleep studies from the National Institutes of Health. They are a comparison to others your age range and gender, and not really recommended amounts. So it's just a comparison to other people.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
@DevonC   A medical sleep study usually includes EEG monitoring.  An EEG is the most accurate form of sleep analysis.  Fitbit uses a combination of your lack of movement and heart rate variability to estimate your sleep stages.  Help article  Please keep in mind that Fitbit's sleep stages are estimates.  One person's flaw in technology is another person's limitation of technology.  Fitbit has a good reputation when it comes to sleep analysis. I have seen posts from other users with other sleep disorder diagnoses.  They were looking for insight, too.  Your Fitbit is not a medical device.  It is technology with limitations.

You can do that with the flex. Just leave it in active mode and log your sleep start-stop times on the sleep log page. fit it.com/sleep
I've always had difficulty waking up, especially in the winter when it's dark in the mornings.  I decided to invest in a wake-up light alarm clock.  It simulates a sunrise by starting with a soft red glow and slowly turns into a bright light over the next 30 minutes and then my alarm goes off.  Before getting this alarm clock, I'd often be in a really deep sleep when my alarm went off.  I would feel really dopey or drowsy and often fall back asleep within a minute or two.  Now, the light seems to pull me out of the deeper sleep cycles just before my alarm clock goes off and it's much easier to get up.  In fact, I often wake up a few minutes before the alarm is scheduled to go off, even on the weekends when it's not set!  Here's a link to the one I bought:http://www.philips.ca/c-p/HF3520_60/wake-up-light
That's a great alternative but I'd rather use two devices. Thanks for the idea.Sent from my iPad
I've done a restart as per instructions; so we'll see what happens tonight.
Have you tried manually entering your sleep time from First time sleeping to last time up. I think fitbit will calculate teh actual time slept and show you awake or restless the other times.NOTE: If you are sitting still in a recliner and not moving that may count as sleep time.
I am diagnosed with primary Hypersimnia and have had the same sleep study in 2006. I think...it was so long ago. I got my fitbit yesterday and I don't think it is on sensitive bit it says it is most accurate to where on your non dominate hand during sleep. I fall asleep...into rem within 2 minutes according to my sleep latency test then and for the first night my fit bit seems pretty accurate. My results don't look much like yours. I will post a screen shot when I figure out how.
I'm a bit tempted to see against my peers, but I want to know what will happen with a trainer if I chose to accept the premium membership? Is it mandatory to take or an option?
Hi I contacted Fitbit help line who took me through the steps to hopefully getting it to track again. There is a small button on the end of the charger, I had to press this 3 times. I have to check whether this has cleared the issue for the next 3 nights  hope it helps. It would not let me post the helpline number on the forum.
@Bartfliet so true, I always try new things since I like to research and read a lot of different techniques to improve my sleep thought. 🙂 Have you tried any of the tips I gave on my first post? I was just wondering? 😅

how does the sleep tracker work
I’m having the same problem
So I wasn't sure if you wanted pics of the heart rate graph or the sleep graphs lol, so I sent these. But as you can see it recorded my bedtime and wake up time correctly but only gave me simplified results. This only happened two or three times, every other night is just fine. And, as I've said before I wear it like I'm supposed to, haven't changed the way I wore it since I've started wearing it, and it works fine everyday. So I know that's not the problem lol.
Sleep score is still not being calculated on my Alta HR.  Checking back, it appeared daily until May 4.  I removed the Alta for a week then put it back on May 11.  Since that date, I have gotten a sleep score only once (on May 18).  I’ve tried the suggestions – tightening the band, wearing it on my other wrist at night, making sure the battery was charged, etc.  No luck.  I really doubt that, during the week the device was lying on my desk, my wrist changed shape or the device was damaged in any way.  I believe Fitbit made a change to their app in mid-May, affecting how sleep score is calculated (or not calculated) on the Alta.  If so, hopefully this will be corrected soon.
In the past few weeks the sleep information I used to get from my Fitbit has changed -- and for the worse IMHO.I used to see good information about depth of sleep. Now all I see is a bar showing total time asleep.  And, no, I have not changed sleep from "normal" to "sensitive" mode. Is there a way to return to the previous sleep view mode?  The main reason I got my tracker is to track sleep quality. That information is no longer available so far as I can tell.
I was browsing the forum and this is the closest post to what I experience. I fall asleep in less than 5 minutes, basically as soon as I close my eyes and I stay asleep until morning. I sleep hard. Most days I sleep through my phone alarm, fitbit vibrating alarm and my alarm clock. My sleep efficiency is usually 99-100% and I average 6.5 hours. When I get 8+, I have so much trouble shaking sleep. But with 6 or 7, once I"m up, I'm up. I do wake up when my husband gets up and 9/10 times when my toddler starts playing in his room when he wakes up. My sleep area is completely blue, with just that red line in the beginning and when I wake up/lay in bed after I wake up for a few minutes. If I'm tired, I can fall asleep as soon as I sit down, even if I'm in room full of people. I sometimes avoid couches for this reason. My husband and close friends tease me, but I've always been like this. It might be a bit worse since I had my 21 month old, but I figure I'm just tired from taking care of him, normal chores, working and exercise. Is this NOT normal?
I want 10 of those kitten cuffs! The cat is included, right?

I am an older woman, recently retired and also have above the average REM but my other stages are within the benchmark ranges. I have a history of anxiety and depression but currently, I feel well.  I have read that antidepressants of the SSRI type can help suppress REM and I wonder if, having been on them for many years (but haven't been on them for three years now), this might be a factor in increased range since I have heard psychiatrists talk about how being on SSRI antidepressants can alter your brain pretty much permanently.  I am not advocating for anybody to stop their medication, of course, but am just curious about the REM.  I suspect as the poster above suggested, that my numbers are perfectly normal for me.
I have figured it out; or at least i have been able to log my sleep. I find it and it is hit and miss. Sometimes i have to tap for ages before getting it to work. The two flashing lights are different to the set of lights that you see if you do a quick double tap (this is a measure of the % of your goal steps for the day). The lights glow in and fade out and the are spaced apart like eyes. There is also a vibration when you have gone into sleep mode. I have found that I need to tap more than twice and I am getting better at it. Good luck because this feature is great.
Fitbit calls that feature "Smart Wake".This is Fitbit's explanation:Note the alarm is a silent vibrating alarm.I believe all models Fitbit currently sells have this feature.  I personally do not use it so cannot give any opinion on how well it works.

We do get total sleep time at the end of our sleep after we sync... I amjus saying once we reach the goal that's set jus like our distance goalonce reached it vibrates and let's us know..same should be made possiblefor sleep so that as an option we can switch it on and make sure we havehad slept our goal and it's time to wake up...
Hello,I have a problem with Sleep monitoring - my Fitbit assumes that I am asleep, when I am awake.I have the fitbit charge HR on my dnon-dominant hand, and I have the sleep setting on Normal and wrist placement on dominant. I usually lie in bed for about half an hour in the morning, listening to the radio and using my phone, however this is still seen as sleep -sometimes I can even go to the loo and still be classed as asleep.I tried using sensitive and had incredibly innacurate sleep reading and if I set the wrist placement to non-dominant, Fitbit overestimates my steps by about 20%.It would be nice to modestly increase the sensitivity of the device during sleep, but not wakefulness, so it becomes more accurate.
Hey @GardenerMichele I myself can not sleep for that length of time. If I get six hours I am a happy camper. I can't even explain why. I am not thinking about anything or worried, it is just how I am. I look at the data as a nice to know, but I can't let it keep me up at night (see what I did there :))If you want some light reading I found this http://www.healthline.com/health/science-sleep-why-you-need-7-8-hours-night#overview1 It can answer some questions about where the 8 hours came from. Sweet dreams!

Hello everyone. @aaaaady It's great to see you around! 
 
@MarciM, @Ace864, @kinvon, @Odyssey13 Thanks for your great input!
 
I personally I have dark circles under the eyes when I don't rest well or when I go to sleep late. What I've been doing so far is to avoid naps in the afternoon so I can sleep well at night and I have said no to the caffeine after 6 in the evening. Finally, stick to a Sleep schedule. (I sleep around 7 hours) so I go to bed around 9 pm and get up early to get ready and then go to work. 
 
All of these practices have helped for me but I'm pretty sure that people put in practice other tips. In the meantime, I'd like to suggest you to visit this Fitbit blog for more information about how to get a good nigh's sleep. 
 
See you around.

Does any else have this behavior? Ever since high school, a long time ago since I'm 66 now I often wake up in the middle of the night and predominately at 3AM in the morning. Sometimes I can go back to sleep after a few minutes but often it is an hour or two before I get back to sleep. It does not matter when I go to sleep. Typically, I try to go to bed at the same time every evening. No remedy has any affect, I have tried them all.
I think that sometime it's just what you're eating before going to bed. Or if you're eating too late too. 
 
I read in an article that women who report better sleep were 33 percent more likely to hit their weight-loss goals, according to a study published in the journal Obesity. Whether you want to doze your way slim, or you just want to wake up feeling more refreshed in the morning, check out these foods that help you sleep.

I changed the setting on the sleep tile from whatever the default was that  showed the line graph of sleep and wake times by pushing an option in the settings part in that tile just to see what it did and it turned into the manual input option. Now I can't get it to turn back to the graph with the original automatic data that was recorded last night and auto-synced. How do I turn the tile back into its default mode?
When you see the heart rate spike, in what section of the Fitbit app are you looking? I found that heart rate information can be found in both the Zone Minutes section of the app and the Heart Rate section. I was seeing the spikes in the Zone Minutes section, but everything looks normal in the Heart Rate section. I also found that if I look at the Zone Minutes graph when I first wake up, there is no spike, but later in the day there is. I don’t know if that is the way it’s supposed to work or not, but it is weird.
I have the Fitbit One and use the silent alarm for many things - like recharging - like get ready to step, etc.!

I have sleep apnea and use a CPAPS machine and have done now for 19 years.  I had hoped / expected that my morning headaches would be eliminated after I settled with the machine.  For the most part my headaches were controlled, however i still wake with a headache quite often.  It was only when I went for my latest check up at the sleep clinic that we decided to check out my fitbit app.  It showed that i had had over 40 mins of REM sleep the night before compared to my usual 10 - 15 mins and I had a headache.  Over the next month I checked my REM sleep and headaches and there is a direct correlation between the two.  I now have a diagnosis for my headaches - hypnic headaches.  Who knew you could allergic to sleep!  These headaches have not had a lot of research and with other forms of migraine there is no real cure.  Good to know why I get them though, I now need to ensure I don't have too much sleep, if I onky sleep when I'm genuinely tired I don't have too much REM sleep.Thank you Fitbit for this amazingly accurate change to your old sleep app.Lian Munday

Hi, I’m really surprised that Fitbit doesn’t ask if you’re pregnant or have recently had a baby. Seeing as this significantly impacts sleep for both mum and dad, I would like to be benchmarked against other new parents however, during the initial data process when I got my fitbit, it didn’t even ask if I have children? Please can this be added so I can work out if I’m sleeping any better or worse than other new parents?
A quick glance at that article looks like it says 13-23%. But I was going to add, I agree it would be helpful to see my #s compared to what they should be, but I expect part of that problem is lack of any real scientific data about what absolute amounts should be, and maybe there is much variability between people. That article compares %s to others, but Fitbit goes a step beyond that and compares to benchmark of people your age and sex.  But who's to know if they benchmark average is ideal?

I switch hands too but never monitor the stats.
I cannot figure out if the One is supposed to be on inside or outside band when attached to arm.
Jawbone has it. I do wonder how well it works though.
Oh? How do I do that exactly? I just check the watch and it just shows the time and everything; I don't see anywhere to select that. Is it in the phone app instead?
@ddsantoy :  I had the same problem and was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea --- not to say that you do but you might want to discuss this issue with your doctor and maybe look into having a sleep test to see if there is a problem that can be helped.  The FitBit is great for indicating sleep deprivation --- it certainly showed me that there was a problem and even though I was "sleeping" up to 8 or more hours quite often I was really only getting 2-3hours of actual sleep with many "wakeups" and restlessness periods.  I have now adjusted my FitBit Flex to "normal" and "dominant" hand as well.  Good luck in finding your solution.  GoldaTyla
Hello Juan! Thanks a lot!
And on the flip side, some people really do just sleep a lot. I have a very active busy life. I take no meds. For as long as I can remember, I lay down and am asleep in less than 5 minutes every night. My fitbit backs this up. I wake up maybe once a night to go to the bathroom and have 94-98% sleep per fitbit every night. I happily sleep 12 hours if I can, otherwise I sleep 7 hours. I am good with either amount but prefer the 12 hours. I've slept this way my whole life and have never thought there was was anything wrong with me. My dad slept this way as well and my  mom used to always tease us that our sleep was clearly genetic as no one else in the family slept like this (they are all early risers and complain constantly about insomnia). My fitbit shows that I move around while asleep (restless) about every hour, with much longer stretches of not moving at all happening toward the end of my sleep (the last 2-3 hours). My dr says as long as I feel rested and I perceive my sleep as normal I am fine.
I ask cause I apparently had mine in sleep mode and only realized when I completely accidentally read this post. HAH

Bought charge 3 on Jan 28 2019.  First two nights it tracked sleep stages but starting on Tuesday it only will track simplified sleep.  I tried resetting the fitbit, fully charging it, tightening the band, moving the band further up my arm, cleaning the sensor.  Nothing has helped.  My whole purpose of buying this model was for the sleep stages and if it doesn't work I will be returning it.
Ditto, totally flustered. I spoke with one of the fitbit versa 2 supporters. He had me do a reset and then check in the morning. I do not see the oxygen variation any longer. It was visible for about 25 days. Now it is gone. Cannot see the present nor past graphs.
I agree completely.  This down grade is not the way to treat customers.  I am going to start looking for another device.

My ChargeHR has kept my sleep records up to 10/25/16. Records disappeared when I downloaded Fitbit on my Android. Android doesn't show sleep quality percentage. Dashboard says I need a tracker that records sleep. Duh! My tracker has been keeping records. Why'd they stop?  Why'd they disappear? Ready to look for another tracker. Fitbit has gotten less and less dependable over the years I so faithfully used and loved it.
I was diagnosed with major depressive problem in 2018. Let's just claim it was rough year yet I've had a lot of improvement given that, but still battle with reduced durations. I have actually had a Fitbit fee 3 for a pair months currently. My favored feature is waking up and seeing my rest patterns, they are constantly interesting, since they alter drastically from week to week as well as with state of mind cycles. My average for REM last month was 15% and also my deep rest was a sad 8% (both statistics are less than average). But what's been really fascinating is that I go into REM sleep first, as opposed to deep sleep. I began checking out this, and also according to study, people dealing with anxiety tend to have very early beginning REM and often excessive. Also when they remain in remission. *. Last week I had a reduced week leading up. to my menstrual cycle (which constantly zaps me into a much deeper low). Certainly my rapid eye movement was very active and very early as well as deep was really reduced. Complying with the conclusion of my cycle, I began following a more "regular" pattern with deep rest launching initially and rapid eye movement coming later on. My deep sleep quantities are horrible tho, last night I clocked charming 12 minutes which was following a late night out the previous evening. Besides the low deep sleep, I noticed my state of mind is better and also I think it displays in my the sleep data. 
Anyone else seeing swings similar to this?

Mine registers every step to the bathroom. And it could be spasticity, which is what I am trying to determine.
I notice that I have some nights when my sleep is very disturbed and I wake up still feeling tired. Other mornings I wake up full of the joys of spring and raring to go but then feel drowsy by early evening. I need to stay awake and alert as much as I can especially when I am teaching a class. This next academic year my timetable has changed a lot and I'm in Uni until about 8pm one evening. I'm wondering how on earth I'll be able to cope with that without starting to yawn in class! I have used lavender oil to help me sleep but still don't seem to get a very efficient reading from fitbit.

That's weird. I would expect the sensitive setting to record more sleep anomolies, not less. I have mine set to normal, and it seems to track my sleep fairly accurately. I can look at the graph and clearly see when I got up to go to the bathroom (awake) and when I was trying to get covers back from my husband (restless).
Hi @Butterfly2honey, You may want to go into the settings for your tracker in the app, and check under the section called Sleep. If Sleep is set to Sensitive, it can give readings like you posted. Is this something that happens frequently, constantly, rarely?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Charge 2,non dominant wrist, high sensitivity. REM averages 12minuets a night,some zero, some as “high” as 30 minutes. Sometimes reported asleep as little as  3 hours, sometimes as much as 6, average Around 5.5. My doctor is under the impression Fitbit numbers are “remarkably unreliable” based on clients whose sleep they’ve studied with the fancy devices. I’ve decided to think of Fitbit as relatively internally accurate but nit realistically calibrated - so I read my numbers as a relative scale WRT sleep, dream, awake times. I wish I had accurate actual times tho...
@cooleymax I think our sleep patterns just change over time. there doesn't have to be a cause behind it, it's just your body and mind going through a change. If you don't feel stressed, your mind isn't racing and your lifestyle is generally healthy, it's just a moment in time and it will pass. I remember sleeping like the dead, then it was more like in a coma and then slightly medicated to restless. Now I am somewhere between medicated and restless- I get a few hours of really good sleep and then the rest mediocre, but still sleep. Can't wait for the next phase 🙂

Well, the only thing I can think of is one fitbit isn't 100 percent right. Mean if I wake up at 8 am and even after taking my meds and such if I lay still for an hour or more it counts me as sleeping. The other thing if it doesn't happen to often I wouldn't worry about it. but if you are still worried have a chat with your family doctor. Also, it will even count just a small change in position as being awake for a minute or so. Also, what is your body temp like during the night. Sometimes you can be to cold and your heart rate increase to keep your body temp at  where it should be.
I do try to not eat as much just before bed but maybe I do need to set my last meal earlier in the evening to give myself some more time. Thanks!
Awesome Janice! Good luck with keeping resting BPM in line - and enjoy those chai lattes! 🙂
95% efficiency is in normal mode. In sensitive mode the first time I tried it I was 42% but I read another post on the matter about sleeping next to someone else and my fitbit's sensitivity. My hubby  has RLS and I often start the night with my arm (with the fitbit) draped over his chest but end up moving away because he is shifting so much. He was setting off my fitbit all night. I had the opportunity to try it on sensitive again when he was out camping for a weekend and I was at 87% efficiency rate when I was the only one in the bed.  So if you share your bed sensitive mode is sensitive enough to pick up bed movement caused by your partner. If you are sleeping alone, my guess would be that you shift your body (possibly dancing legs like my husband) but don't move your arms much so sensitive mode picks up the other movement while normal mode only picks up when you move or shift your arm. Do you feel tired when you wake? honestly that is the best determination to how well you are sleeping. Without my CPAP I felt exhausted all the time no matter how long I was in bed.

I too suffer with poor sleep.  I blame my age probably caffiene intake also.  Lots of things can factor in to poor sleep.
Husband and I just got our Inspire HD fit bits for Christmas. Last week our sleep reports included all the sleep detail, REM, deep sleep, light sleep, awake.  But this week it is just reporting awake time and sleep time.  All the other information is correct, just missing the specific sleep data.  Anyone else knows what's going on?
Hi @Flynn!Is it normal for your device to show around 3%, or is it only the last night? You may remember a dream as if it had been long when it may have lasted a few seconds. I think the most important thing about sleep is that you feel rested when you wake up.Apart from that, it is also important that the setting for sleep sensitivity is set to normal in the Fitbit App on your phone.

32, M, fitbit charge on non-dominant hand and set to sensitive.This is a typical night. I had a deviated septum that was causing issues with breathing and just recently had it corrected. I can breathe much better now but that did not fix the sleeping issues. I also got a home sleep study done. The results came back very positive so Doctor said he doesn't understand why I'm saying I'm not getting good sleep. I think my fitbit disagrees. Additionally, I've also decided to quit coffee to rule out caffine. I'm on my 3rd month now and no improvement. I've installed f.lux (or compatible software) on all of my devices which removes the blue light that emits from LCDs.I have absolutely no problems falling asleep. I close my eyes and i am gone. My issue is, I literally wake up 6-8 times a night. It's quite annoying as each time I keep thinking it's time to get up, until i look at my watch and it reads 1 AM, 2 AM, etc. Waking up refreshed is a really really rare occurence. I only recall 2-3 times in my life where i felt refreshed after waking up. Doctor told that was a profound statement indicating that I did have an issue. However, after looking at my results he thinks I am totally fine.
That sounds a bit weird! Id suggezt you try restarting the Ionic a rew times and see if that gives you better records in future.Restart your tracker

I recommend restarting your tracker and trying to log sleep again tonight. A restart is a good troubleshoot for these types of issues. Additionally, you can change your "Sleep Sensitivity" setting to sensitive from normal in your "Device Settings Page." Keep us posted on the results!

I just substitute other things. I drink flavored seltzer or soft drinks without caffeine instead of cola. After I've had my morning cup of tea, I switch to decaf or herbal tea for the rest of the day. Now that the weather is warmer where I live, I drink a lot more water too.

I started using a Fitbit recently and am noticing that my HR goes up and down all night long. Is that normal? Goes from like 50 up to a high of 70.
I just started using my fitbit flex and can't tell when it's in sleep mode.   When I tap on it two times, there is no vibration.   It responds the same way regardless of the times I tap it. New to all this.   Appreciate your advice.
Hi @DannyD_PNG - I can sympathize with your predicament. Unfortunately, the only way to currently get what you describe is to use a medical grade device. But the current blood oxygen variation graph can be a good tool to share with your doctor. Between the two of you, you can track how often the spikes occur and whether or not a CPAP machine is called for. When things got too bad, my doctor suggested a CPAP machine. I fought him on this. But when I finally gave in, the tracking on my Fitbit verified the improvement and also clearly showed how much better I was sleeping. I also shared this with my doctor.  Team work, with the help of my little Fitbit device.
You should drink (in ounces) half of your weight.  We have water challenges in our group all the time.  Very important to rid your body of toxins too!

@trainer wrote:You don't. Once you manually log your sleep time, whatever activity happened during that time period will automatically get translated into sleeping/restless/awake per the fitbit formula.What I don't understand is why sometimes my tracker will automatically log my sleep and other times it doesn't and I have to enter it manually. I engage sleep mode the same way each night
I've only been using Fitbit for a short time, but this morning when I looked at my sleep record I can't figure out why it looks this way.I went to bed around 11pm.Woke up at 5:30am and had to come down stair for medicineWent right back to bed, then got up at 7:35am to go to the bathroomFinally got up after 11am, never touched my phone and say I was awake or going to sleep other than the first time I went to bed or got up the next day.The Fitbit broken this timing into 3 groups and on the 2nd and 3rd the pink is not solid but striped.Out of almost 1 week I have many nights where I have solid pink, but there was 1 night that all the pink was a striped pink.I have essential tremor and was wondering if this could possibly be the cause of the striped pink sectionsI was wondering if others have had this same type of sleep records or have any idea why it would appear this way
I can't really see the image too well, but to me it looks like the math is wrong.. if it were to log four hours and your sleep ended at 10- your start should have been at six and it doesn't look that way.. so I am thinking it is just wonky for that day? How has it been since?

I found this post through Google because I'm experiencing a similar issue.  However, in my case often times I see HR activity on both graphs, but the Active Zone graph is much higher.  For example my regular HR graph said my HR was 103, but the Zones graph said it was 124. I really need to know what's *actually* happening with my heart rate in these instances.  I know Fitbit is not an FDA medical device but it should not be telling two stories from the same data.  The original post was almost 3 years ago, I hope they do something about this.
How is your "Sleep Sensitivity" setting configured; "Normal" or "Sensitive"?  If the latter, try the "Normal" setting and see what you come up with.  That said, if you're already on "Normal", then I would contact your doctor and have a sleep study done. Anecdotal comments: Back in the early 2000s I was suffering more and more from poor sleep brought on by a number of health issues (starting with a badly broken leg and being non-weight-bearing for six months).  I finally checked myself into a sleep clinic in 2007 and when my results came back my Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor asked me, "Why aren't you dead?"  Yeah, my sleep was that bad. The good news was I got myself on a CPAP machine and my sleep issues were literally cured over night.

I have the charge hr and it seems pretty accurate for telling my sleep. I have read several complaints over it is inaccurate.Ok... To the question! Where should I wear my Fitbit when I go to bed? Would you put it up higher where you would work out with it or maybe where you normally wear it? Im so confused!

Thanks!  This helped answer my questions as well since I was seeing a similar pattern.  I've had sleep issues for a long time (10 years or more) which I've assigned to many contributing causes including shift work, stress, obesity and others.  Even today, I often feel I get better quality sleep from an afternoon nap than I do all night.  The fitbit has somewhat confirmed that.  I am also hoping that by loosing the excess weight, my sleep quality will also improve along with stress relief from the added exercise.

I completely agree.
So, researchers and specialists appear to concur that leaving your AC on during the night is quite protected. Also, some really suggest it since the ideal temperature for resting is by all accounts on the cooler finish of the range.
Your Coach and Parents probably know that it takes two hours for the body temperature to drop after physical exercises.  Sleep is not possible with an elevated body temperature.  So I ask," Why is a 14 year old at soccer practice until 10 p.m. at night?"  I have grandsons your age who live in NYC.  What is an eleven year old doing at a school chess match until 11 p.m. at night.  It is insane. What is the priority here. Are you training for the Olympic soccer games? The USA culture is training you to burn out by the time you are 21. Good luck!
My resting heart rate is about 88, 89 , 90. Is this bad or normal? Anyone else have such high numbers? And what do they mean?
I really dislike the new sleep logs. I step very lightly and it took a LONG time to figure out how to get my fitbit to register my steps correctly. I changed my settings to dominant hand (even though it's not) and light sleeper (even though I'm not), and poof, my fitbit now records my steps correctly. The only pain in this is that I would have to go in and manually fix my sleep logs from light to regular (which I do about once a week).With the new sleep log I am no longer able to do this so I don't know how long I really slept. This is disappointing since it took quite some time to figure out how to get my steps to log, and now my sleep won't log correctly.PLEASE fix this.Boo on the new sleep logs.
I've had my Fitbit Alta over a month and the last three nights it quit recording my sleep stages. Now, I'm only getting how many times I'm awake and restless. I've reset my Fitbit and set it to sensitive...nothing helps.
Your doctor prescribed medication based on a print-out from a website without looking into the specifics of the data, much less verifying its accuracy? That sounds like a much bigger problem than Fitbit not adding up your sleep times!
Try to look for external influences, noices, open windows, a wrong pillow, electronic signals, seems like thats where you have to find your solution.

I had it for a short while and now it is gone.  Even my past graphs that were there are gone.  What's up?
I believe you can log in your sleep manually.  Go to the sleep log and delete the record and then readd it.  Hope that works!

I used to have this. I had more frequent high peaks than you did. I went to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. I wear a CPAP every night and no longer have this issue as long as I wear my CPAP.My doctor referred me to the sleep clinic because I had issues with migraines when I woke up in the morning.
I have the same issues .. nice to see I'm not alone ... wont make me sleep any better though ...
@Erica2busy  I don't know what the result will be -- I don't know my husband's password to run an experiment on his phone.  I can say for certain that sleep logs can be edited.  When you tap on the sleep tile, then on a specific day > tap on the   º º º  and edit the sleep time. Here is what to do if checking on her while she is asleep breaks it into a section with sleep stages and a section with sleep patterns.  Delete the log that is sleep patterns, then edit the log with sleep stages to cover the entire time.  Sometimes I nod off on the couch, then wake up and go to bed.  I get a nap with patterns, then my sleep with stages.  After deleting the nap and editing, I get a complete sleep stages log with an awake time added in. I hope this helps.

I personally got a lot out of this Fitbit. I had problems with nightmares and what it showed me about my heart rate was speechless. My mom saw it one night and was worried a lot about this. However, this helped me to discover my issue with dreams. My granny advised me of her colleague Amanda, who is a professional medium and helps people interpret their dreams. I got the consultation and was satisfied with her methods and additionally with her articles https://dreams-meaning.com/blog/bees-in-dreams. She gives us a chance to find about everything because there are some meticulous things that a person may be worried about the most. Overall, the situation is wow, the Fitbit is wow, and my dreams are okay because the medium is wow. Have a nice day!
It actually is still in the app on the phone.  It is just really tricky to navigate to.  You need to swipe the graph 4 times to the left to get to the graph that we all like.  Then press the graph to get to the average for the week.  I really hope they do not keep this way of getting there, it used to be so nice.  Good news, there are a lot of good smart watches on the market now that hopefully do not force changes on their customers.
I've only had my FitBit for less than 2 weeks, so I'm still learning the features.  I don't get a sleep score every night.  I do tell my FB that I'm going to bed, but in the morning when I tell it I'm awake, I don't get a sleep score.  Is there a setting I should check.  Does anyone know why this might be happening?

I have always had a lot of sleep problems and the underlying reason for them also seems to change as I get older (and I'm still in my 20's!!).  I agree with the other poster that you should try changing your time to go to bed around and see what works for you.  I have been trying techniques for years and something will work for a while, then stop being the solution.  I just ordered a Kindle paperwhite so that I can read myself to sleep each night without the LCD/LED lights of my iPad hindering my melatonin levels so much!  It's a love/hate relationship with all these technologies lol.  Hope you have found some rest lately!

Hello everyone! 
 
Did you know bad posture in bed can cause your muscles tightness, spasms and headache? 
 
A pillow that is too high can put your neck into a position that causes muscle strain on your back, neck, and shoulders. It is recommended a pillow that will keep the neck aligned with the chest and lower back.
 

Remember that good posture doesn't apply just to sitting and standing. In order to protect your back, good posture is also important while sleeping. This way you wake up feeling rested and free of pain. 
 
Have you struggled with neck or back pain recently? If so, how have you dealt with it? Feel free to share your experiences.

I believe I have an idea as to the problem...  When I first started exercising after work, I got home from work around 5:20.  I'd feed my dogs, and put them outside.  Then I'd hit the park by 5:30 for a 30-45 minute walk, and home by 6:30.  Shower, cook dinner, eat, and be on the couch by 7:30.  Bed by 10:30... Today, I leave work at 5, hit the park by my office by 5:05...  Walk until 7:30..  Home by 8:00..   Shower, cook, eat, and on the couch by 9:30...  Where I'm full of energy, sometimes tired, and not sleepy...  Finally I go to bed around 12:30.. Walking as much as I do now, is really leaves me so full of energy.  I find myself walking full steam even at the grocery store.  I don't have the slow walk anymore.  And I don't mean to powerwork at in grocery isle...  I just find myself doing it...I'm getting less and less sleep.  I went from averaging 7 hours down to just under 6...  I'm just going to have to deal with... The other night on a non exercise day, I was out like a light at 11... I'm just exercising a lot, and it's screwing with my sleep schedule...  on the plus side I'm down 11 lbs in 3 weeks...  33 lbs lost..  64 to go...

Hi my Fitbit Luxe did the same, I contacted the UK Fitbit helpline. They told me to press the button at the side of the charger 3 times (not sure on other models).

By 'turning on the sleep feature', if you mean "begin sleep now", that is not recommended.  You should just let fitbit figure out your sleep by itself.  "Begin Sleep Now" was just for older models that did have heart rate tracking, which is now used to detect sleep.  Older models had to detect sleep just by lack of movement, so needed the "begin sleep now" and "I'm awake" to prevent quiet awake times being detected as sleep.  But now with heart rate being used for sleep detection, that is best not used at all, and in fact can prevent sleep stages being detected.  The one use I have found for it is for shorter naps that would be too short to normally be detected by fitbit, i.e. less than an hour. If you were not referring to "begin sleep now",  I don't know what you meant by "the sleep feature".

Shann,you are correct. You can only have one fit bit device per email account. What you could do is once the data has been update on one, you could type the data into the other one. I know it is a lot of work but you then would have it all in one. Not sure how fit bit could change it since they have it all allocated on a email account.have a great day. Jim
For charge 3 go to your track sleep. In the right hand corner press the +sign and you can choose a one off track my sleep. When you wake up you let it know your now awake. Not the best way to track a nap, and ive not tried it myself yet, so don't know if there is a time limit.
My Charge has been working perfectly and I've really been enjoying all its features. Last night, however, it didn't log my sleep. I've checked the Charge itself, my desktop and my Iphone. None have sleep logged at all. What has happened? If I reset my Charge, do I lost all my data for today?

Way to get your groove on @hallieb99! Sounds like you were busting all sorts of moves in the dance floor. We really appreciate the positive feedback, and I'll pass it on to the team. Meanwhile, keep those feet tapping.
I have certainly had much more trouble sleeping since getting my One. It's a bit disappointing because one of the main reasons I chose it over the Zip was for sleep tracking!Last night was the breaking point, 3 am and still wide awake so I just gave up, took it off and fell straight into a deep sleep.  I'd love to be able to wear it again but I'm just far too conscious of it. The wristband itself doesn't bother me at all, I can't even feel the thing on me, it's just the awareness of it tracking that keeps me awake.. It'd be good to know if anyone else has managed to overcome similar issues!
Thank's SteveH! I will try this and update this thread
I've wondered the same about the two settings.  I have tried sensitive but I am afraid it is picking up on my husband's movements in bed?  Is that even possible? Anyone else worried that it may be "too sensitive"?  I am genuinely curious.
Hey there. I'm not very active on the discussions here, but I thought I would share my story with you, as it was soooo similiar. Like you my sleep pattern was scary. I didn't even know I had a sleep problem until I got a fitbit, although I never quite understood why I was always so tired. After talking to my husband about my fitbit results, he told me that I was a snoring machine! Yikes! In my specific case, it looked like the snoring, was causing a lack of oxygen and was waking me up multiple times a night. I finally went to my doctor who recommended a sleep study. Turns out, I have sleep apnea. I've always been in great shape and health with healthy habits throughout the day (not much caffiene, not much sugar, small meals, etc etc., so for me to have sleep apnea was a huge eye opener. After much hesitation, I opted to purchase a CPAP machine. Hesitation because they are bulky and just plain ugly. But now that I use the CPAP every night, I sleep like a baby! My sleep pattern on my fitbit looks so much different than it did before. Most of my friends have also had results like these, but no sleep apnea, so I think its case by case.  Most people's results are just fine. But for me, if it wasn't for my fitbit, I wouldn't have known about sleep apnea and its dangers. So glad I got one! Good luck!
@PieChi Thanks for,posting this. Is this taken with CPAP? Mine looks to be a lot worse than yours if we are looking at deep,sleep direct to awake spikes. What is it about your graph that indicated apnea in your opinion?
Hi @LZeeW, I wasn't nauseous at all...in fact, I was kind of hungry after I got my doses. I had just about every other common side effect except that, fever, and chills. No stomach issues for me at all. Two of my friends however wound up sick to their stomachs. They both had COVID previously. One said it's her baseline for shots to get nauseous. The other said she had all her COVID symptoms come back, which included the nausea. Mom got both Moderna shots, she wasn't nauseous either...she was hungry like me. She also knew people who were nauseous about a day after they received their shots. As far as the SP02 things, I looked at the heart rate info for the day before, of, and after, whoa...what a difference! Mine jumped about 10 bpms!  Took a look at my Mom's heart rate info the day before, of, and after... apparently she's been ressurected from the dead....she had info for before the shot, after the shot, but not during the shot...and she was wearing it while she got the shot! 😆 For what it's worth, I got Pfizer. By the way, 4 days later and all my side effects are GONE!

I forgot to tap my tracker in the morning after I woke up and it has been in sleep mode all day. What happens to my data becaus​e I left it in sleep mode?
Hi @SunsetRunner. I don't know if this is software, but I recently noticed a similar thing. My resting heartrate was around 62-65 bpm for the past couple months and then all of a sudden in the past week or so (March 10 - March 20) it went from 62 bpm to 69 bpm! I was not really stressed when my HR began its going up, although the same can't be said for the past few days. I'd say keep an eye on it if it continues to climb. I read that it could point to an underlying illness, so I'll be monitoring mine.
@sleepingtonight Nice to see you here. I think that it depends on which tracker or watch is more confortable for you. I've used the Flex, inspire HR, Luxe and Versa with no issues during night but some other users prefer small trackers to sleep. I'd go for Versa always, it's been working really good for me.

@Lifestooshort99 Mine is like that too. Some nights nothing. Other nights a spike or two mainly. Did you ever look more into it?
I’m a mouth breather at night (or was) and I knew it was disturbing my sleep. I recently discovered mouth taping (Somnifix) and thought I would give it a try. After two weeks of mouth taping, I am convinced of the benefits. I am more focused, my brain is clearer and my tracked Fitbit sleep is improved...very little restless sleep. Who knew?  There is science behind the negative effects of mouth breathing and here’s a link to help understand it: https://askthedentist.com/mouth-tape-better-sleep/.I am sharing this with the hope of helping others achieve the optimal sleep they need. I will add that mouth taping is not necessarily an option for everyone, please do your research. 

	“A person who resolves to begin regular morning exercises usually does so not because he already has physical fitness but in order to get something he does not have. Once one has something he can be anxious to keep it; previous to that, he is anxious to get it.”
As above......I sleep well and feel refreshed in the morning, but have no memories of having had any dreams during the night. I'm sure that I must have them, but can't recall anything, whereas my wife can remember hers vividly (and my children also).

Hi , Fitbit' s response to me was not to wear it at night! I have found that even if i wear in the day but take it off at night I still dream but the dreams are not as vivid and like you I am not usually a vivid dreamer.I wish they would do some research on this. I don't suffer with headaches but some people are suffering with migraines when wearing so it seems to me that wearing the fitbit triggers something in certain peoples brains and if I wear the R&D department at fitbit I would want to find out what could be doing this. I do not know how to get Fitbit to take this as a serious side effect or to to find out how many people this affects or if something is awry with our brains!!SaleghSent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
Thanks so much! That's actually _doubly_ helpful because I'd been doingthat for naps anyway, but had just decided not to (because the Charge 4 wasgood at automatically registering them anyway). But it's good to know thatI should probably just keep doing this when I remember.Really appreciate all the help.

I don't expect this will satisfy you, but all the same information is still there, if not quite as easy to find. Q: Has weekly sleep average been replaced by sleep score, or moved to Premium?A: No, weekly sleep average is still available to everyone. To view it, tap the sleep tile in the app, swipe left on the graphs at the top until you see “Hours in Sleep Stages,” then tap the graph to see your weekly averages. All Fitbit users will continue to have access to their time asleep, sleep schedule, sleep quality details, as well as weekly hours slept compared to their sleep schedule. Additionally, all Fitbit users with a device capable of heart-rate tracking will also see their sleep stages and sleep score.

Hi, can I ask how much magnesium you are taking?
Thank you for responding! I have set it to normal. I also saw my Dr who hasreferred me for a sleep study. I'll let you know how it goes tonight on thenormal setting.--Sent from Gmail Mobile
I really like the "sleep cycle" app. I use it on an iphone, and it wakes me up gently within a 10min window of my set alarm time. The idea is to wake up when you're emerging from a sleep cycle so you wake up feeling more rested, even if you've slept fewer hours. I find this better than being stunned awake by an alarm sound. Plus it tracks my movement while sleeping and provides me useful information about my habits.
You can find more details on the effects of sleep modes in this help article.
 
The "Sensitive" setting is quite sensitive indeed, and will detect even the most subtle movement as restless sleep or time spent awake. It can be effective in monitoring your activity if you are collecting data surrounding a sleep disorder, but most users should find the "Normal" setting to be more accurate.
 
Regardless of which setting you choose, the best way to use this data is to note change in patterns over time - it's best to pick the one that feels most accurate, and stick with it while watching to see how your nightly sleep records compare from week to week.
It appears to me that the One will record what appears like steps as my arm moves in the night during sleep. I have been told that if I simply log those hours I sleep, that the steps recorded will be nullified. I have an alternative. On the One, you can put it into sleep mode. Why not make that the default, so that the time it records as sleepthe web application knows not to add those steps into the total. Then for those who are rare cases they may want to override the default. I think there will fewer of those than want to ignore the steps. The device does not have to do anything different. Only the web application and the interpretation of the raw data changes.
Hi @paradox622 - moved your post to the sleep forum.General guidance for this can be found online as there are a lot of recommendations, but may be put the dog in another room for starters! Lol

Author | ch, passion for improvement.
do you know how many steps that you have moved over night?  I think that may give you some information on how you sleep,  I did not know how bad my sleep is until I used my FB HR.  I move somuch(about 1000 steps) and the sleep efficincy is around 30% on sensitive setting.
My oxygen variation levels are pretty much in the middle of the lower box. I have COPD, and difficulty breathing. Does anyone know what the ranges are for the high and low boxes? I have a Charge 3.

I don't know if anybody at Fitbit keeps track of these comments, but for the record I hate the "sleep score". I actually really liked the 'sleep' feature before; I don't need to be "scored" by some arbitrary standard. There should at the very least be a "yes/no" option for showing the score. Ugh.
we don't appear to have an answer!
Depending on the current weather condition over there in your city
I have it on normal, was hoping it was sent on sensitive. I did set it to sensitive and then back to normal hoping that would trigger something. Also, slept with it on sensitive mode and it yielded similar results.
What is premium service? What is the point of having on the Fitbit charge if you have to pay extra to get it? Charge 3 is disappointing all round, it does not track my sleep or give me messages, emails or move reminders. I have reset it so many times , plus it does not sync daily? I have cleared all the tick boxes then re ticked them..nothing I do makes it work well.
Hello @MathTutor. Welcome to the community forums. 
 
Thank you for the detailed information and for the steps you've followed prior to posting. In this case, I'd suggest restarting your Fitbit device by following the instructions here: How do I restart my Fitbit device?
 
On a side note, if your body is almost at rest while working, (Working from a desk) then it could explain the reason why your Fitbit device might be tracking that as Sleep, but it actually should not happen and the Fitbit devices start tracking as you're asleep after you haven't moved for about an hour.
 
In this case, I'll suggest trying to change the Sleep Setting to see if that makes any change. Take into consideration that Normal mode works well when you make significant movements, so your device records time spent awake. This setting is appropriate for most users. In sensitive mode, your device records nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake.
 

In the Fitbit app, tap the Today tab
, then tap your profile picture.

Tap Advanced Settings > Sleep Sensitivity and make your changes.

Hope this helps.

Hi Chris.  I have the same issue of poor sleep.  I just bought a Fitbit HR for the sleep & heart rate tracking and I have to say I am very dissappointed.  I already have an iphone app called Sleep Cycle which shows when you are awake, asleep and in deep sleep and it seems to be much more accurate in tracking than the Fitbit.   I really thought that the Fitbit, costing lots of money, being attached to my wrist and monitoring heart rate as well would give a lot more info than a line graph!
well, 15% of 8 hours is 72 minutes. so, tossing and turning for a couple minutes even 10 times would get you to 85%

I've just recently got my Alta and it was gifted to me by my friend. I can do everything with it however, I don't know how to put it on sleep mode. Even if it is automatic shouldn't there be a set time for sleeping and waking up. I just set my sleep time to 11:00 pm and wake up time to 6:00 am yesterday, however, last night I didn't get any notification and 11:00 pm or in the morning at 6:00 am. I don't know what I"m supposed to do. Can anyone please help me?
This started last week on my Versa. Five out of 11 nights there was incomplete data, so I don't get the Advanced Sleep Analytics (just looks like a nap). I pay for the Premium, basically for this one data point because this is the one thing I am really interested in besides steps and calories burned, etc. Two nights ago I got the same thing and today it is complete, which is weird, but last night, incomplete again. I haven't changed anything about my bed or the way I sleep, so that's out. Sure, I could purchase a newer model, but why if this one "works" and I like it? I could purchase a new one and have the same issues. There is always an issue after an update, but I don't recall there being one in the last two weeks. Gonna try the good old "turn it off and on" and see if that works.
Hi @naima01 Welcome to the forums. There can be many factors that impact your sleep pattern. You should start looking for patterns if you have some days you sleep better than others. Start tracking your food, exercise and stress. When you wake up suddenly, are there environmental (light, noise, change in temperature) that are causing you to wake? Are you drinking water up until the time you go to sleep are wake up to use the restroom. The more data you can provide the better all of us can help you. Good luck!

You definitely need to have a sleep study done. My guess if that you may have sleep apnea. I do and have a CPAP machine. It works wonders. Losing weight will also improve your sleep, and is one cause of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea can effect your weight and blood pressure. Get it done soon.
I have the surge. And just to mention again my iOS app is up to date and this is my third replacement because of the band breaking.
Yes, @MrsJohannah! This is what I do as well. Thanks for sharing.

Was it an interesting movie?    I'm assuming that you heart rate going down to resting rate combined with no movement could be interpreted as sleep.  Sometimes on a weekend morning I will get up, but read and maybe even doze off.  It can easily be identified as sleep.

Glad to see this topic.   I just wanted to fall asleep a bit faster.  I bought Melatonin 3 mg.   So, I took a 3 mg and cut it in half, so I figured it was about 1.5mg.  I felt less was more for me. It was a quick dissolve, under the tongue. I took it at 9:35 pm. I was just starting my nightly routine of mindful meditation, at 9:45pm,  about 45 mins before bed, with no TV, no cell phone, no lights, cool temperature, no Blue lights etc.  5 mins in, I felt the effects. Climbed right into bed! Fitbit Charge 4 says I was awake 30 secs @ 9:55pm then went into light sleep.   Didn't like the feeling  it gave, felt like it was taking over, but the thing is I slept longer but only 14 % REM and about 24 mins of Deep sleep,  and 68 % of Light sleep, which was unusual for me.  Most times I will have equal amounts in both.  Maybe 1.5 mg was too much.  Or possibly I shouldn't take any more.   I use the Calm App
hey there. are you asking which model fitbit would be right for you? They are different in style, size and price. They all pretty much have the same metric information. I would peruse this link  to see what models are available with which features that you are interested in.

This is the 5th night my Blaze is not tracking sleep stages. I had an issue with syncing so I chatted with support. I updated it and restarted the Blaze. It is still not tracking sleep stages. I only get the sleep pattern like I did on the Charge HR.   Does anyone know what is going on or how to fix it?

lml124 your sleep is not normal! Normal people do not fall asleep randomly in the middle of the day. Sounds like Narcolepsy or some other sleep disorder, there are many with similar symptoms. You will have to see a sleep specialist to find out for sure. Make sure you find a good one though. I was tested for sleep apnea 12 and 17 years ago, both times they said it was not that bad. I was diagnosed with Narcolepsy after the second sleep study without doing the MSLT. Tested last summer for sleep apnea again and now I have severe sleep apnea (stop breathing 39 times an hour). This doctor doesn't think I have Narcolepsy (had the genetic test, negative), she thinks that I had sleep apnea the whole time. Slight chance that I could still have Narcolepsy, but not worth stopping my medicine to take the MSLT to determine once and for all. As far as your Fitbit registering sound sleep all night, mine shows the same thing on normal tracking, set yours to sensitive tracking and it will show more movement.

This is the iOS App and this is a proper sleep graph showing all stages. How did I get it ? By wearing my Fitbit while sleeping. I was trying to help but it seems you are not appreciative of that. I will stay clear of this topic and will let you troubleshoot on your own.
I like to recharge it at bedtime. I wear it most of the other nights, though. But...if I'm having insomnia or a bad night's sleep, I take it off. It makes me more anxious about falling asleep or staying asleep. And I found that the sleep suggestions from Premium can make me more anxious, knowing I'll get a reminder the next day that I didn't follow the suggestion that night (not because I wanted to, but because I couldn't sleep).
It seems sleep score (new feature) is being rolled out to users: some already have it, others don’t. See this other topic about sleep score. My guess is you belong to the first category, and sleep score has replaced the weekly average. I belong to the second category: I’m not getting any sleep score yet, but I still see the weekly averages.

I find for me if I have them near me, I am more inclined to take a peek if I wake up which is more disruptive than if I lay there staring in space and cursing my lack of sleep. I refuse to bring anything to bed with me. I am lucky enough to have a husband who brings his phone to bed so in case of emergency he is the go to (although he could sleep through a zombie apocalypse - maybe not the best plan). I turn my phone off every night by 830 and I shut the TV off by 1030. After that its anyone's guess how long I will stay asleep, but I find if I stick to a pattern it works out better...

I've gotta say I'm disappointed in Fitbit's decision to make the additionalsleep data only available to Premium subscribers. I'm OK with a Premiumsubscription for Coaching, etc but don't hide data from me and then expectme to pay so that I can see it. #moneygrab
Anyone?  I"m new to FitBit and was hoping someone could help me.
@Dominique: Not sure about these glasses or any particular tint for blocking the blue light. I can tell you that I work in front of a computer 8 hours per day and found that when I started this job, I had trouble sleeping. I only need reading glasses but my eye doctor prescribed "computer" reading glasses with a UV blocker of some kind for when I am at the computer or using my iPad to read. It worked. I began sleeping normally again. And the lenses are not orange. They are clear looking through them with just a hint of blue to purple when you look at the lenses on their side.

@ruther4ord  Since having deleted the alarm in the settings (on account through fitbit website or phone), when the tracker sync's (pc or phone), it has to remove the alarm on the tracker itself. If not already done, try to restart the tracker: Restart the tracker URL: Click to go to the Fitbit Help Article 'How do I restart the tracker?'
I am not getting sleep stages as I did with Alta he. Have tried wearing differently and restarting. What is wrong?
Same here. No sleep stages being recorded starting last Friday.
It continues to track when in sleep mode, so you won't lose/miss any steps. If you accidently put it in sleep mode when awake, it does create an activity, so if you ever look at your activity log and see a bunch of logged activities that you didn't do, it is probably times you put it in sleep mode. They don't affect anything though.
Pretty sad, today my alarm did not go off again.  I was awake and waiting for it....this is one of the reasons I got this ....
Anyone else not using the wristband for the fitbit one? I tried it the first night and after a few minutes could not use it so I just left it cliped to my top.  I find that it does track my sleep. I wanted to know if its better on your wrist or better on my shirt? Would it track more of my restless sleep of my arms moving or because I keep it on my shirt does it track less movement.
Fwiw, I have been diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea (AHI of 16) and use a ResMed AirSense 10 Autoset (auto-titrating CPAP machine), with an SD card.  I just bought a Fitbit Charge 3 yesterday and last night was my first night with it. I had a lot of little red ticks throughout the night that don't seem to correspond to any of the machine's registered apneas.  My AHI last night was 0.83, excellent numbers by any means, with four central apneas and 2 obstructive apneas. I still wake up feeling less than refreshed and slightly zombie-like, and as my fitbit reported, I only got 34 minutes of Deep Sleep (normal being a bit over 1 hour according to the fitbit benchmark), so I feel the apneas have nothing to do with this and fostering better "Deep Sleep" is my therapeutic target at this point.
I am 81 and fitbit app does not take into account my age!  Older men have to usually get up at least one time during the night to pee .  When I get up my sleep screen split into 2 separate sleep sessions and then i have 2 sleep screens reading 4hr. Sleep and another screen reading 4hr 10min will that nights score of 74 or less . Had the app not split my sleep session in half I would have a more accurate sleep score of 80 and above like i get using my wife’s Apple Watch, she is 81 also!!!
I also have around 30% average of REM sleep, however I’m different like other as I don’t suffer with any anxiety or depression. I have to refreshed after 5-6hrs if sleep. I love learning, being challenged an engineering company on a daily basis. I also enjoy mediation and psychical activity like yoga, or aerial activities like pole. My activity practice always gives me a different perspective a lot of handing upside down 🙂 I assisciate my high REM with a lot of learning on daily basis so it’s not always bad. For those who feel tried I would suggest you first come up wit your sleepy routine, wake up early, do some exercises, plenty of water. But I also think you need to look at the quality of air you are breathing a solution in closed spaces is really high. Add all those chemicals you use for cleaning and washing your clothes, dust particles and no wander you’ve wake up tried. Poor diet also contributes to lack of sleep. For those suffering with anxiety and depression i would suggest mediation, this does wonders and really helps u to understand the root cause of our anxiety and feelings of depression. Have suffered for depression for few years. You can help yourself guys and i stongky believe in you.

Good to hear you made progress. When I have syncing issues I disable bluetooth on my phone for 10 seconds. That typically solves it for me.

To enter sleep mode, tap your Flex rapidly for one to two seconds (about 5-6 solid taps).Your Flex will vibrate and display two slowly dimming lights to indicate that you have entered sleep mode. When your Flex is in sleep mode, goal progress will not be displayed if you double-tap. Instead, your Flex will alternate two blinking lights back-and-forth to indicate that you are currently in sleep mode. When you wake up, tap your Flex rapidly for one to two seconds to exit sleep mode. Now if that doesn't work for you, I have also had really good luck tapping ABOVE the light bar (right where it curves around your wrist).  Another thing to try is using your fingernail to lightly and rapidly tap it (above the light bar) - like you are trying to scrape some dried on gunk off of it.

I've had the same problem now for a couple months.
@EdmundC How has it been for you since posting this? My graphs and info have been fine since getting the latest update.
where do I go to check normal vs. sensitive sleep setting?
We have 3 FITBIT's after moving from the Apple Watch due to battery issues and the promise of better automatic sleep tracking. Sleep tracking was a MUST and had been working up to September 1.Since 9/1 the sleep data no longer displays SLEEP STAGES but a rudimentary SLEEP PATTERN. Af first we all went to make sure all apps and OS were up to date. Next we check band usage and reset phones, watches. It took until 9/3 that FITBIT acknowledged this is a system wide problem and it still persists. I understand there is a server update that is the cause for this problem but what I cannot understand is why FITBIT would not have rolled back the server software to the previous release before rolling the new server software out.  Very sad, disappointed, and dissatisfied and if not corrected soon, will be quickly looking at other comparable smart watch technologies.  Pastor Bob

Welcome to the Fitbit Community forums, @sleepingtonight! 
 
 All wrist-based Fitbit devices automatically detect your sleep when you wear your device to bed. When your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep. 
 
I've had a great experience with the Charge 5 so far and with some of the latest watches, like Versa 3 or Inspire 2. 
 
Are you interested in any other features or just the sleep tracking option?

Fitbit always starts new day at midnight.  You still get stats for a 24 hour period, but just not the 24 hours you would want.  There have been several requests for this option.You can look at the Feature Suggestions board and find such a request and vote for it.

Sleep apnea can be diagnosed in the home.  I was sent to a sleep medicine specialist, and was sent home with a breathing machine.  I slept with it on for a few nights, then took it back.  That's when I was diagnosed.  Thanks to my Fitbit, I am now being treated.  There is very little to lose by taking the test; and a great deal to be gained.  If you don't have sleep apnea, your doctor can help you find a solution for your problem. I have friends that are not overweight, and don't have thick necks, but still have sleep apnea.  Quit guessing, and put your doctor to work.  He/she needs the "practice." Good Luck with whatever you decide. Marie from Rosevill, CA

Hello @Judy101, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for the information! 
 
This is really a great suggestion and I understand how helpful it'd be to integrate this! While this is not available (combine Sleep logs or Sleep Scores), I'd recommend to post this idea in the Feature Suggestions board so our developers can take it into consideration for new updates or product development. Take into consideration that our team strives to improve the Fitbit experience based on our members feedback. 
 
On a side note, this is an expected behavior. If you wake up or get up during the night, it is possible that your Fitbit device will start recording a second Sleep log. For more information, I recommend visiting this help article: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
See you around.

I have sleep apnea and used to use one of the CPAP devices which were recalled by Philips. For about 8 months, I have stopped using it. Now I use Versa 3 which was said to be the best to track sleep records. But unfortunately, I cannot track my sleep as thought to. Why do not have a graph which has sleep and spo2 values on a time axis? While I was using my CPAP device I used the free sleepyhead app which would take my sleep records data from the device's SD card and let me see all the stats in a very nice way. To let you know how the screens look please look at https://bit.ly/fitbits2. (Please note that I would delete the link in a couple of days.) So is there a way to see all my data especially sleep and spo2 data on the time axis? I would like your dashboard to have a kind of the same look as seen in sleepyhead app.
I noticed the same thing, I'd been keeping a spreadsheet of my sleep values recently and noticed that all of the times that I'd recorded were off. I updated them to the new values, and today noticed that the values have changed once again. Very confusing!
Sorry, I just got the fitbit Ionic and so am an FNG, but I can't find the advertised Sleep Tile anywhere to analyze sleep.I looked both on the Ionic and my Android phone. I see lots of other tiles, but not Sleep. I don't see anything in the manual either, it seems to just assume it's there.

The alternative would be to have it record it as awake time, which would break your sleep into multiple cycles. The restless sleep is probably better. Check your sleep sensitivity, though, to see if your settings make sense to you. The issue is that the device isn't able to discern whether you are getting up for the day or if you are just going to the bathroom. The associated steps are a tip off to the device that you are up and about. Hopefully it will end up to be a minor issue within overall sleep tracking.
I have used the sleeve and the left it clipped to my pants at night.  In general, the sleeve will show some more restless patterns (but not always).
Hello & welcome @lynnkrupp I'm sorry to see that you're having problems with the sleep app on your Fitbit. If you don't mind me asking, which Fitbit are you using? Are you having issues with any other metrics in the Fitbit app?

Thanks for drawing a good topic. I become so tired from a few days and become a hunt for sleep talk. I don't know what happened to me just going to sleep and shout. After sometimes my wife called me and I don't go to sleep whole night. Kindly someone gives me release from it.Thanks
Hello @Alfiemoon  Could you please detail your request ? What do you want to achieve and what actions are you doing ?
I have had something similar happen a few times. Just edit the sleep log, don't add a new one. When you look at your existing log, click on the three dots in the upper right corner and edit. Change the end time to when you actually woke up. That should do the trick.
Hello @Chinni86, welcome to the community forums! @cathm, it's great to see you around and thanks for your input!
 
@Chinni86 I'm glad to know that you've been working so hard to achieve your fitness goals! Please keep up the great work! As you may know, getting enough quality sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety. However; there are some factors such as stress, irregular sleep schedule, mental health disorders like anxiety and depression, physical illness and pain that interfere. 
 
I think most of us have had a similar experience and we have found some helpful tips. Here are some tips that have worked for me and I think other users will read your post and will also comment here to give you more ideas. 
 
1.Reduce blue light exposure in the evening. 
2. Stop watching TV and turn off any bright lights 2 hours before heading to bed.
3. Don’t drink alcohol. It also alters nighttime melatonin production, which plays a key role in your body’s circadian rhythm. 
4. Relax and clear your mind in the evening. Strategies include listening to relaxing music, reading a book, taking a hot bath, meditating, deep breathing, and visualization.
5. Taking a hot bath around 1 and a half before bed improved sleep quality and helped people get more deep sleep. 
6. Get a comfortable bed, mattress, and pillow
 
I also invite you to visit the following thread for more recommendations. 
 
Hope this helps!

84 is the best I ever had. I don't have premium anymore so no sleep score breakdown.
I tried this last night and it worked for me as well. Will keep doing it to see if it consistently works. Easy fix if it does but curious as to why.
I personally don't trust those vaccines and I recommend you think twice before taking this step.
Sleep always counts on the day you wake up, so 8:30 pm to 10: pm counts on that day.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Thanks! Such great and educated advice. ! Shelbeegirl
I have sleep apnea and was diagnosed with chronic insomnia over two years ago. The care/treatment plan prescribed by my Neurophysiologist addressed all of my sleep issues and I now average seven hours of sleep per night. The fitbit one in normal mode is fairly accurate at recording my awake and restless times.  I wore two activity monitors for over two months and they usually recorded within 5% of each other.  These devices are adequate for gauging the quality of sleep I'm gettting and alert me if I'm having sleep issues. Reading a nontechnical book helps me get to sleep fast.  About one hour before bedtime, I avoid television, computers and exercise. If you're having serious sleep issues, see a Neurophysiologist.
That sounds a bit weird! Id suggezt you try restarting the Ionic a rew times and see if that gives you better records in future.Restart your tracker

If you beleive a certain activity causes insomnia, you'll experience it. That's the power of our minds, you need to believe that it doesn't make a difference. You can see this with sleep pills, people swear up and down they help but science shows they barely increase your sleep efecctiveness by 10 minutes. It works because they believe it will work.  I thought my medications where causing insomnia, then I read up online and verified it was impossible because the medication goes away after a certain point (8 hours), the next night I didn't have insomnia.
From my phone, it says I can do it from my phone. It states I can push the house screen when I'm done as well as it'll still track my sleep
@Piotrowski thanks for reaching out and posting your screenshot!
 
As others mentioned, it's very likely that you have your sleep settings set to Sensitive, instead of Normal.
 
To change from Sensitive to Normal, follow these steps:
1. Login to your account at Fitbit.com
2. Click Settings in the top right corner (the gear icon)
3. Click on 'Settings' from the drop-down menu. 
4. In the left column, click on Devices
5. Click on your tracker type (Surge, Charge HR, Blaze, etc)
6. Scroll down to Sleep Tracking
7. Switch from Sensitive to Normal
 
I've included a screenshot of the area where Sleep Tracking settings are located on your fitbit.com profile. You'll notice the last row, titled Sleep Tracking. 

To learn more about how to switch, check out this help article!
 
I hope this helps you - please do let me know how it goes! 🙂

This happened to me with my flex two at the beginning. Now I’m using it and inspire HR and it’s doing it as well.
On August 1st my sleep scores came back. But again, last reading on the 9th! I did get an update though so I don't know if that broke it again or if its glitchy. Just kindof weird (funny?) that both months my sleep score and stages stopped showing on the same date. No change in wear or sleep.
I have a flex, and on the cellphone it does show the total, but not the website. Can we get that fixed?
Maybe check out this article. https://blog.fitbit.com/why-do-you-even-need-sleep/ (Fitbit Blog, scroll down and it's called Why do you even need sleep?)Might have some info that could help. Also, try some gentle stretches and play some relaxing music (can find some good ones on youtube) before you go to bed. Calms the mind down and releases tension from the body. Hope this helps. 🙂
I had this exact same problem the first few nights I owned my Versa (and it's only been a week.) I would wake up from detailed, long dreams and the record said I was awake, which was totally wrong.   I read somewhere that someone said he had to do the following, which I did just as he described it, and it made a complete difference:Turn the watch around so that it's on the UNDERSIDE of the wrist before going to sleep, and make it TIGHTER.  For example, I wear mine at 4 notches during the day but tighten to 3 at night, which  makes a little impression on my arm but of course does not cut off circulation.  And it's on  the INSIDE of my wrist (palm side.)  Suddenly I could see REM periods accurately.  Meaning, I woke up several times from detailed dreams, looked at the record and sure enough, there were 20 or more minutes of REM recorded.  It's worked great three nights in a row now.  I hope this helps you.
First of all, the display for sleep data is simply lame -- and I hope that means that the Fitbit software developers are busy behind the scenes building a better interface. Here are my suggestions:
 

Most other graphs on my Fitbit come with summary statistics over week/month/year, and sleep should have these, too. Everyone can have a bad night or a great night, and you need to see the big picture in order to know whether you have a problem or not. The "monthly" and "benchmark" displays on the sleep stages are a good start.
Along with summary statistics, another really important way to get the bigger picture is to quickly move through the days by paging forward and back over longer periods of time. This is totally impossible with the current interface where you have to drill down through multiple screens and pop ups to see a graph, and then come back up through all of those levels and drill back down to see the next or previous day. Every Fitbit graph should have swipe left/right to get to the next/previous day. On the phone, swipes are most natural, while the web interface the left and right triangles work great.
Everything shown on the phone interface needs to be available on the web interface. (I'm hoping that this is a simple case of you guys are working on it and it's not done yet. Certainly the one graph that is available on the web -- the sleep stages -- has a great interface on the web as opposed to an adequate one on the phone.)

4. We need access to the raw data!

A CSV file with timestamps and heart rates.
A CSV file with beginning times, ending times, sleep stage. (The info that appears when you mouseover the sleep stage graph.)
With the oxygen variation graph, I know that the Fitbit is not an approved medical device and so you can't really give us the SpO2 levels, but can you give us a CSV with the timestamps and the variation level (the data on the graph) at least? For those of us looking at data from other sources, knowing WHEN various things are happening is very useful!

Anybody else have arguments as to why some alternate ways of displaying info would be better? Or ideas for other info that the Fitbit should give us?
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
On the nightly sleep stages page there is a continuous line that goes from awake through REM, Light and Deep.  There are also small red blips at the top of the page in the "Awake" line.  Does that mean I am awake briefly even though the continuous line is not connected to the red blip?

I can track everyone else at night too!My husband worked a night shift, fitbit tells me he got in at 11.27pm.I remember waking up when the dog jumped on my knee, fitbit shows me it was 3:20 am.It seemed like my dog was pacing around in the morning waiting for me to get up for hours, fitbit tells me it was more like 5:10-5:40am. background: I'm a really heavy sleeper and don't move or wake up unless there's a disturbance.
I fully agree.  We can opine till we are blue in the face, but it would be great to hear from the Fitbit people.  I will update the graph every so often as well.
No, no current Fitbit model is able to measure blood pressure.
Thank you for responding! I thought I was missing where to look after I signed up for premium. I hope they bring it back.
I set my versa 4 when I go to bed and I turn on the sleep feature on the app. I get two different readings.
My sleep score disappeared from the app yesterday. Still not there even after re-installing it. I have a Charge 3
Yes!!  I’ve only been using my CPAP for 1 week and my sleep data is worse that before!   Like you, my CPAP is showing a good record of sleep…. I use a Sense Fitbit and my oxygenation spikes are low but my overall oxygenation % for the night is super low…
HiOn one sync say I slept 9 hours and 50mins... next sync it'll say 7hrs 45mins... can somebody help it's driving me nuts please?! I called Fitbit today again and they said I'm not the only one with this issue they say it's on there end... anyone else having this issue it's driving me nutsThanksAshley
My Charge 2 sleep graph does not show benchmarks.  How do I access on desktop?
Since I posted my topic I've been searching around.It seems this may be the "old format" of the sleep graph. The help article announcing the new graph style (the only one i'm familiary with) says that it may revert to the old graph if (A) You take a short nap less than 3 hours, or (B) you sleep in a positions where the heartrate sensor can't measure your heartrate.I'm not sure if my Blaze band came loose last night, or spun around my wrist, so it's possible that it couldn't detect my heartrate and reverted to the old graph/data format.However, if it also happened to you (and I'm curious if it happened to others last night) FitBit may have rolled some changes out yesterday which broke things.
I don't know much about sleep tracking but this help file on the subject seems comprehensive: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163/
any idea how i can be less restless at night?!
When I use the sleep mode on my Charge my alarms to get up in the morning are silenced? Is there a way to change this?
I hadn't realised how much REM sleep we needed.  I never get enough deep sleep but my REM I thought was okay, until I read this!  However last night I apparently had 31% REM sleep, which for me is unheard of.  I'm another that suffers with anxiety and depression and I take medication, have done for years, which often makes me wonder if it's messed up my sleep pattern.  My 30 day average says 14% for REM and 10% for deep sleep.
I noticed this happened to my premium account too. I used to have graphs and different sections but now it is just one line of sleep, restless, awake. I updated the Fitbit app online (iPad Pro running iOS 13.5.3) I thought maybe it was that. Nope, still just shows a line. Now I’ve been wondering if there is a firmware updates for the the Versa 2? And, if so, how do I do it? Had the Versa 2 since early December & this is the first “trouble” I’ve had. 🙁 I know my sleep isn’t good. I have fibromyalgia. I want good sleep logs.
My sleep record provides two sleep logs, one on the night I slept and the other for the following day on which I haven't yet slept. Why is this occurring? See the screen capture of my log here that shows both Sunday on the bottom and Today (Monday) on the top.
I wake up between 25 - 35 times per night. Average of 1 hour of sleep lost. It says I have a high "efficiency" (90%+), but I feel like I am waking up every 15 minutes or so. If this is true...how would I ever be reaching REM sleep? I have had my fitbit Charge HR, for about a week. I eat pretty natural, only water, very little tea. So I don't think my diet is the issue. Do I need a sleep study done? What do you guys think? Attaching the image.
Thanks for the response. Glad to know I'm not the only one!
I have noticed according to my Fitbit I get too much REM sleep and in what I have read possibly causes my anxiety and agitation. It doesn't seem to matter how much I sleep, I still over do the REM sleep. Even if everything else is right on the mark. Is there someway to help this or is this just "me"?
I used to exercise every day in the morning and hit the gym at night. I had asthma but with the inhaler, the problem was nothing big. The only problem I faced was at night while asleep. I had interrupted sleep which made me wake up in the middle of the night struggling to breathe. The wheezing sound even wakes up my friends in other room. Then I have to take inhaler and after that going back to sleep is almost impossible. So I used to get hardly 3 hours of sleep every day. Recently I started using a CPAP machine. This gave a good relief for the sleepless night. I'm a bit concerned now. Will this affect my natural lung capacity? Now I don't feel low even while going out in the morning for the exercise or at the gym. But I think I started to feel that tired fast. I'm not sure if it's just my feeling or for real.
@LeftCoastBlue  Same as I posted above. There is currently an issue with sleep tracking. Please read the first post of this thread. click Welcome to the forums.

Hi there - I have been using my flex for 2 weeks - I had similar problem at start of using flex when it wouldnrt sync automatically when i first got up in morning.  I found that once I had moved around and done a few things, the flex had sync'd my sleep with my phone app and pc. ,
This is not to say the sleep information provided by Fitbit isn't helpful. I am merely saying that our perception can be colored by short-term results.  Tracking my sleep week-to-week has been a valuable tool.

What model Fitbit do you have? I turn the sleep on and off with a button on Force. You can manually enter your sleep time too if you forget to press button.
I'm writing this on my phone so it'll be a short reply but I  just want to say before I forget (due to brain damage) that turning off all technology at least half an hour before bed really helps me and it sounds like it helped you last night too! Maybe make your bedtime 11pm or even midnight to see if that works for you as you're not a morning person and see if that works for you?  🙂

Correct, but if in doubt, just make sure you buy from somewhere that allows returns, such as this website, so you can return it if not so.However, note that on any device you can have problems not getting sleep stages, supposedly because of not getting consistent heart rate reading throughout the night, though it might otherwise appear that heart rate readings were consistent.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
As I've mentioned in other posts, if you see short arousals in your sleep (usually around a minute long) you probably have a form of sleep apnea. I'd look at your sleep pattern and consult a doctor.
I would view the "resting heart rate" reported on the FitBit app with a great deal of skepticism. When I'm truly "resting" - ie. sitting quietly, not having consumed caffeine, etc. or recently run up a flight of stairs - my heart rate is a steady 71-72 bpm. Sometimes I can sit and watch it rise three or four beats just from the stress of worrying about my resting heart rate. But according to the FitBit app - my Resting HR is a (dangerous, IMO) 88-90 BPM.  Apparently the algorithm FitBit uses to calculate resting heartrates is based on people who have a different lifestyle to mine.
I have a Versa and up until one month ago it showed my different sleep stages. Now for the last month it just shows the basics, no sleep stages (deep, REM, etc). I have restarted it, cleaned the back sensors, slept with it on the other wrist and nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?
I like to combine Oriental music (Japanese/Korean/Chinese) with rain sounds since that helps me relax and have a good nap 😴
 
Do you have any kind of preferred music or white noise that help you to sleep?

Same here!  My fitbit is new, I have 8 days of a nice colorful graph that also includes deep sleep data, and today it's different - as you describe.
Hello @MoonstoneWolfMy mom got a Fitbit Alta and we're testing the Sleep sensitivity settings and what's better for her. Last night she got a graph which was quite similar to yours and we were testing the "sensitive" setting. You can check if that's the same for you by clicking here: https://www.fitbit.com/settings/profilescroll down the page till you find "Sleep sensitivity" and try to set it as "Normal". From what I understood, the sensitive mode will easily pick up every little movement as if you were restless/awake and I am inclined to believe that in case of my mom, even when she snores 😛With the "Normal" setting, her graph seemed to be more accurate. I'm not sure if this might be your issue, try to change your setting and see what works better for you!

Same Here!!my REM sleep is consistently  above the benchmark in the 24%-36% range (28% mean).When it gets to the mid thirties I can usually tell though, and I feel a little groggy when waking. Also, my deep sleep is consistently lower at 5%-15% (12% mean).
I can see how to change it usinfg Computer based Dashboard how do I chaneg Sleep sensitivity using Android App? Is it even possible?
You should get tested for sleep apnea. I suffered from this for many years before I was tested. what happens is that you stop breathing for a time then hopefully your brain tells you to wake up and breath. Your fit bit is reading this reaction as waking up. If that is your problem you will find that using a C- Pap or what ever is prescribed will improve your sleep and you will not be waking up tired or sore.
Hey everyone, You can still check this information within the Fitbit app. If you go to the sleep tile, the first thing you see is the weekly bar-graph with the sleep score.  Just swipe to the left until you see the hours asleep graph, which has a bar-graph with the time asleep every day.  If you want to see the average sleep for each week, there's an even better option now. Just keep swiping to the left until you see the "Hours in Sleep Stages" graph, and then tap on the upper right corner to expand it.   There, you can see the average sleep time per week and month, with the advantage that you can adjust this interval by simply sliding the graph left and right (you are not restricted to, let's say, Sep 2 - Sep 8). Hope this is useful!

Hi @rsp - Here what you need to do to track your sleep - click here >Sleep. If you wear your One at night using the sleep band and manage the sleep mode as described in this article, your sleep should track automatically upon your next sync and you should never have to log anything manually. Once a sleep record shows up on your Dashboard Lot | Sleep tab, you can hover your mouse over it and use the Pencil Icon to edit it, should you want to changes to the sleep and wake-up times. If you happen to be wearing our One at night, with the sleep band, but forgot to invoke the sleep cycle, you can enter your approximate bed and wakeup times, and fitbit.com will still be able to report your sleep time and sleep quality, based on your movements or inactivity during the night. But you would do this on the Sleep tab, not on the activity list. If you booked a sleep activity using the activity log, I suspect that this log entry is conflicting with your sleep stats - just hover your mouse of that record and get rid of it by using clickin on the garbase disposal icon.
I agree! I bought my fitbit earlier this week and have tracked my sleep for the past three nights. Every night has a short spike right above the treshold. I have no idea how serious/bad this could be.
OK, so I've had my One about a month now.  Bought it so I could wear it during the day like my Zip, but I wanted the sleep tracking.  I don't feel like I've had a good night's sleep since I was pregnant (my son is 6 now).  I wanted to see just how bad it was. The first night or two I had it on normal sensitivity.  It logged closed to 8 hours sleep and I knew that just could not be right.  I don't feel rested.  So I switched it to Sensitive.  So my efficiency is usually around 50-65% and I typically have 10-18 restless episodes totalling 2-3 hours a night.  I think that's much more accurate. I know it's not perfectly accurate though.  Just because my arm moves and it records restless, am I REALLY not asleep (just because my arm moved)?  And I know there are times it's recorded me as asleep just because I'm laying in bed - awake - but my body isn't moving.  So I figure there's a give and take. Now, I normally wear it on my left wrist - non-dominant for me.  I tried wearing it last night on my dominant right hand, but the stupid band came off in the middle of the night.  I think the velcro got caught on the flannel blanket and got pulled right off.  I haven't tried it again.  Do you all fing better results with your dominant or non-dominant hand?  Or is it related to what side you sleep on more?  I usually sleep on my right side. I don't wear pajamas, so clipping it to clothing at night is not an option.
I got this specifically to track sleep and the sleep score really is atrociously inaccurate compared to the sleep data. In all cases the low scores are my best night sleep, looking at the high percentages in each stage & the worst nights have the highest sleep scores with the lower percentages on each stage. The new oxygen levels also show that when I have a high variation my sleep score is higher?!! And my heart rate has remained pretty constant in all cases. Time to get an Aura...

Hi @SleeperC - Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. You must have been very absorbed in your work! You can turn on Reminders to Move or just make it a habit to get up and walk or at least move your arms every half hour or so. It’s a good healthy habit, anyway. You can ready more about Fitbit and sleep here.
Hello everyone, I love my Fitbit Surge, no matter I have rash on my left wrist... It's getting better, anyway. But what I don't like, apart from no light / deep sleep charts, is its inaccuracy, when it comes to falling asleep. I wake up & sync, still in bed. It shows in bed 2:59 - 6:04, time to fall asleep: 0m, in bed: 3h5m, actual sleep time: 2h34m. No restless / awake, besides falling asleep.I edit time to 6:00 (when my alarm woke me up), so the "time to fall asleep" updates (why this haven't been fixed yet? :(). Now it shows in bed: 2:59 - 6:00, time to fall asleep: 31m (which seems +- accurate), in bed: 3h1m, actual sleep time: 2h30m. No restless / awake, besides falling asleep.I know I didn't fall asleep before 3:29, so I edit my time to 3:29 - 6:00. Now I have time to fall asleep: 4m (2:59 + 0:31 = 3:30 vs 3:29 + 0:04 = 3:33), in bed: 2h31m, actual sleep time: 2h24m. And also 3x restless besides of falling asleep.Why does it differ so much? It's all generated from same data, so why it doesn't show restless / awake, until I edit it to 3rd version? 😕 The 3rd version seems to be the most accurate one, because I remember I was restless 2-3 times. I use Xiaomi Mi Band at the same time, because it can really distinguish between laying in bed and falling asleep / waking up, with unbelievable accuracy.
You know when i show people my fitbit and explain all that it does the most interesting part everyone says is the sleep tracking! They all say that would want to but it to use that feature so Fitbit need to step it up and make it air tight as the best sleep tracking out in the market
Harperjean - thanks for that! I'm def going to see my doc. It'd be lovely to sleep well!

Just to make sure, you are not starting the sleep tracking in the app? When you do that it won't register sleep stages. For that you should let it automatically track your sleep.

Hi, sorry but I don't understand why you react on my remark about softwarefor smartphones. I clearly mentioned that I'm looking for a wearable (not asmartphone app) with the feature "wake in light sleep". My remark was justthat more than 5 years age this type of feature was already available forsmartphones, and for over 2 years on some wearables such as Jawbone, soplease...And, it's not because I react on a post in the "Fitbit community" that itshould 100% be related to a Fitbit device, so my "question" regarding yourremark was totally legitimate (I just wanted to make 100% sure you werereferring to Fitbit).But most importantly, you didn't react on my main remark, that is: Fitbitstill doesn't produce a wearable with this feature, which is for me a mustfor buying such a device. So please do you have any remarks on that (howcame they sill do not have this feature, will they have the intention to,and when will they...)
i have charge 3.I too have similar markings on my charts. I don't think I have a problem with sleep apnea.It would be nice if the oxygen level chart could be overlaid on the sleep chart to compare times. Maybe one could compare the different levels of sleep to when the oxygen levels raise higher. whether one is in a deep sleep, in rem or having a nightmareor just gasping for air because of nighttime dry mouth as I sleep with my mouth open many times!
I have a FitBit Alta...love it but I want to know about the sleep tracker times.  I went to bed last night at 10:35 and woke up at 4:30 am and it says I slept 4 hours and 34 min.  How does it come up with that time?
Here is my short answer: if you have sleep disorders, keep sensitivity "normal" (default value). Fitbit will have plenty of opportunities to pick up your restlessness with it.

I have been seeing that I am much more restless after the new sleep stages is introduced. For eg. this is generally how my data used now look like   This is how it used to look like 2 months ago.  Are others seeing the same ?
At this point, I am getting less information vs more.  Is there a place that tells about the upcoming updates?
Okay...this may be a stupid question BUT I am gonna ask anyways. What does it mean when it says your sleep effeciency is 92%-im assuming its good but just not sure what it exactly means LOL. Does it mean I sleep 92% of the time im laying down? sorry if its a stupid question- in my defence i have been sick all week 😞

Hi @Matt_Saze - What are you eating or drinking before bedtime? I’ve found that can make a big difference to my sleep ... the quality and the restlessness. I finally just stopped eating and drinking anything - other than a couple sips of water - after 7:00. Another thought, have you tried meditating when you wake up in the middle of the night?
My Inspire HR occasionally records periods of sleep during the day when I am up and about,nighttime sleep logs is generally accurate.
I've been doing this too, and it's been working well. I don't charge it every night, because it doesn't need it that often and I don't want to put too much wear on the battery by constantly topping it off. But certainly taking it off an hour or so before bedtime has made a big difference in getting good sleep tracking. Hooray for the Fitbit Community!

I just have to say that I find it odd that throughout the night I can wake up 27 times and my sleep efficiency is still 91%??? How does that happen? Maybe I don't understand this data correctly...
Hi Marcy, Thankyou will give that a go.

Maybe try to tough it out and do your homework after school instead of the nap. Then when you get home from soccer practice hot relaxing shower and then you can get to sleep earlier.

Hi @gutimd - Sorry to hear you are having problems. Can you please tell us which Fitbit device your have? There are several HR models. With that information, I’d be happy to try to help.
I don't know what I did, but I was trying to enter start and stop times in my sleep log, a message came up asking if I wanted to delete my sleep log. It gave the option to cancel or delete. I clicked cancel but now when I go to my Dashboard the sleep tracking information isn't there. How do I get it back?
Hi @zennode , We're not sure yet. Fitbit did send out an email today stating the beta program would end on the May 20th. No word on when it gets released to everyone.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Anyone else using the new pulse ox feature and being told that you die at night? lol! My nightly range is from 89-93%... which seems like I'm oxygen deprived at night. Of course I know that it can't be medically accurate since it's on our wrist and we move around a lot, but just wondering if anyone else is getting really low ranges. And are we all at 93% right now? I compared to 6 friends, everyone's said 93%.
Bright light and lack of melatonin reduce REM and deep sleep. Try limiting electronics and lights in the evening and take melatonin pills (or drink a big glass of 100% tart cherry juice). The nice thing about your Fitbit is that you can experiment and see what works.
I'm having the same situation. I actually haven't gotten more than 3 1/2 hours of sleep in the past 7 days according to my FitBit Force. Is this possibly true? I have noticed that I haven't been feeling as rested lately but I'm in bed for 7-8 hours every night. It told me the other night that I only got 2 hours/17 minutes of sleep and that I was awakened 30 times. Can that be true? Should I see my Doctor?
Whoops! I have a Charge 3. That's weird. I guess I'm used to my Misfit, it would pick up sleep stages as long as I slept at least 30 minutes it could detect deep, light, awake. But it died so I wanted to try fitbit. I have insomnia so I usually cant sleep longer than 4 hours at a time. Does this mean that maybe fitbit might not work for me for sleep stage readings?
The charts would show spikes above the line.  The spikes would be yellow.  So you would have a green line that changes to yellow as it moved above the line.  Indicating possibly a high SP02 variance.   If you had "severe apnea" I would expect you would see several of those spikes over the evening.   If you have "mild' apnea the spikes may not be captured by the Fitbit.   Also, you can look at your SP02 reading during the evening.  You need to download the SP02 screen for your watch to capture your SP02 during the evening.   If it is below 90% there's likely something going on.   My SPO2 is 93% to 95% on any given evening.   I have mild apnea and wear a mouth guard.  If I have an "event" it will show as a yellow spike protruding past the line.  Your graphs generally look fine to me.   But, with that said, I would not rely on Fitbit to determine if you have sleep apnea.   You would need a real sleep study.
Hi Stuart, thank you for taking the time to respond to me. I've figured outhow to get sleep analytics - it seems that when I click on "begin sleepsession now" it does not provide me with details. If I just go to bed,without doing that it analyzes everything. 🙂
I am contemplating upgrading to Premium in order to access Sleep logs. I intend to use this when seeing a specialist who will be conducting a sleep study on me. However, the Dashboard only shows weekly data. Is there a way to get a long-term historical trend report on your sleep? i.e. Sleep Efficiency Report that spans over the past year? Thanks in advance for your help!
I find the Fitbit One wristband very uncomfortable for sleep.  At the risk of giving TMI, I sleep in the nude and anything on my body causes a disturbance.  I tried the band for 2 nights and was very conscious of its presence--the band is noticeable, whether loose or snug and I was concerned about moving my arm too much or rolling over on it.  Consequently, I could not sleep.
I'm telling you that all (to the best of my knowledge) wrist-based devices track this way. Short of going to a sleep lab, that's probably the best you're going to get. There are also some apps on phones that do it based on trying to listen to your breathing, but everything is subjective. Sleep is a difficult measure.

I agree completely.  This is a very disappointing business move and is disrespectful of customers.  The data you receive should match what you purchased, and it no longer does.  If they are going to take away something that customers have already purchased, then they need to provide a refund!
Helena,does Fitbit have any mindfulness meditations that would be useful for Deaf people? I’m trying out the premium and none of the videos or whatever they are have captions.
my friend suggested to me that I get this sleeping.  spray at Bath and Bodyworks it’s for when you go to bed you spray 2 squirts on your pillow and you fall asleep and if you wake up you can’t sleep he scored two more sprays it  helps a lot and I love the scent

Mine is doing this more often, even after long periods of sleep. It used to give me a score even with sleep periods under three hours, now after over 5 hours of sleep, I'm not getting a score.
Any suggestions on what could be the problem?
Very disappointed in this new feature. Is very intrusive, you don't need to be given any random score. Many factors are involved in sleep including age, health, more/less need for sleep, work time, etc. Should have an opt out option, even a toggle switch like they have for other items on the dashboard. Poor that this was added with no notice or feedback. Customer service mentioned there is no way to eliminate it at this time. Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Have had no problems with this device or its operations until this was added today.
Bummer. I guess it's not the cure-all I thought it might be!
Thanks for that 😁
No reply from the help desk and no reply here, maybe I should stop my subscription?
Another easy fix. I use a small zip tie it acts llke the little band on your watch. I just slide it up to take it off and slide it back down when i am wearing it. I have used this for about 4 months and works very well.
Which Fitbit device/bracelet... to use for most accurate sleep tracking?

Having the same problem here. Was taught in school to use the right to write, I eat with my left, grab things with my left, will even cross over to open doors with my left, but my left side is also much stronger then my right so I end up holding babies on my left which will when walking through stores immobilize it where it doesn’t track points. I can walk and count 50 steps and it only tracks 13, so I don’t know if it’s a dominant/non-dominant issue or if it’s cause I’m only 5’1 and they naturally track a much bigger stride then my measily 12 inches. I like my fit bit but I get really frustrated with it too, it won’t track steps if I’m pushing a shopping cart either.
Those are great ideas. Hopefully we get more challenge options in the near future. Most floors climbed could be integrated too.

I'm curious what the 'normal' times you are restless is.
That's a very easy issue to resolve. Delete one of the sleep entries, and update the other one to include the total time you were in bed. Note: You must do those two things in that order. The menu options are labeled Delete Sleep Log, and Edit Log.
Try to keep a consistent sleep schedule. That usually helps to keep you well rested. But it's also sleep length that counts. A consistent schedule of around 9 hours will be more restful than an inconsistent schedule, even with days that you sleep really long. I'd say that the sensitive tracking is probably too sensitive. While you sleep, you do move around, so to have it think you were awake for 4h50m of your sleep doesn't sound right. I'd go with the less sensitive tracking. I also recommend getting 8h or 8h30m of restful sleep as recorded by your tracker. Try sleeping for 9h to 9h30m. Or at least make total length of your sleep be that long. After factoring in the restless and awake bits, you'll have close enough to the restful sleep. You'll also feel more rested. Exercise also helps to relax your body, since you'll body will want to sleep more soundly when tired. I hope this helps 🙂

I can not figure out why my Charge 3 does not show sleep score.  I have read posts and read posts.  Changed this and that to the point that it is totally annoying!!
I like doing sprint intervals, running or on the bike. Cross country skiing is great too, but you need snow for that. 😆

Laschingert,I'm from Michigan and have Blue Cross. Insurance paid for the study so I don't know what the cost was, just that I was very dissapointed in the reccomendations given and the lack of 'listening' the 'therapist' did. So again, as so many of us have found, the medical proffession is more interested in what they can get paid for than actually helping, (sleep apnea is a $ maker).  I don not know what the magic is with the combination of Melatonin and an antihistamine is, just that a pediatrition suggestion suggested it for my 4 yr old grand daughter. It worked for her and both of her sleep deprived grandmas! As to taking melatonin causing the body to quit producing it I had not heard that before. Exercise DOES seem to help.
I was the same way...I bought a new mattress and now I'm rolling over once or twice a night instead of 30+.  Another way to sleep like you're dead is to walk 30k steps, and run 5-6 miles before going to bed...You won't move much.
I belong to the same group that pwung0327 does -- old men who have to get up in the middle of the night.  My takeaway from reading through this topic is that for those of us in that group the Fitbit sleep score and sleep log are not accurate and cannot be accurate because it's programmed to start your sleep over every time you get up instead of logging a period of wakefulness in the middle of your sleep.  I do not expect an inexpensive wrist-worn device to equal or even approximate the accuracy of a sleep study, but it would have been nice to get a useful approximation.  To that end this thread has been helpful and I will lower my expectations.
I wonder why you want this? I get that you want to get enough zzzzz's, but why not turn around and try some more when you don't feel rested and get up when you do feel rested? That is what I do when I don't need to be somewhere early. That way I listen to what my body needs instead of what  a timer says.

I am pretty appalled that the website has this sort of deficiency.  The iPhone App can correctly tally up the data from the exact same data back end without any problem.  There is literally no reason why the website can't do that as well.  To say I am disappointed in their inability to address such a trivial deficiency is an understatement.
One night I got almost 7 hours of sleep and I get a score of 72 and the other night I barely get 5 hours of sleep and I get a score of 76?
 
Also, do you have any literature which justifies Fitbit to apply the HRV rather than the brain monitoring to estimate the sleep stages?
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
My last sleep score that I received was on July 9, 2020. Charge 2. Have tried tighter, looser, under wrist, other wrist, under other wrist. Reinstall app, resync fitbit to account.  Nothing. I have occasionally gotten only the simple graph but used to be only every once in awhile. Maybe once a month or so, until now.
It could be but that could also be spikes from dreams, things waking him up, his looks nothing like yours
I have the same problem. I primarily bought the Charge 2 for the sleep graph but only get basic information. I'm so annoyed and feel a bit ripped off. Two friends have the charge 2 and showed me the graph and that's why I bought it! The shop where I bought it won't take any responsibility.
Thanks Matthew, my data has been Classic for the past three nights.

Alicat:  I wonder if getting one of those dual control mattresses would help? I forget what they're called but you can adjust one side of the mattress without disturbing the other side.
I have had trouble sleeping for years but have never really brought it up to my doctor to get it checked out(stupid I know). However, I recently purchased a FitBit Charge HR and have been noticing that my sleep is worse than I thought and I am constantly restless throughout the night. I am wondering if anybody has ever taken their FitBit sleep tracking data and used it to have a conversation with their doctor? Is it enough information for them to go off of in terms of recommending things to help out?

I am 59 or  I will be on July 26th. For some time now, I wake up several times during the night due to needing to go to the bathroom and I don't drink the amount that they recommend that I drink. After I finish in the bathroom, I don't immediately go back to sleep again.So after doing this several times a night, I am robbed of a substantial amount of sleep. My fitbit says that I average three and a half hours a night. I have always been a light sleeper who sometimes took a long time to go to sleep or couldn't sleep whenever I was worried or excited about something but I didn't wake up several times during the night as I am doing now. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, I get a chance to get caught up on some sleep but not during the work week when I have to get up at 6:00 in the morning. Last year I woke up but only once due to needing to go to the washroom but in the past few months, it is now more than once. I think it is around three times now. And all these health website are all saying to get 8 hours of sleep a night. I would be happy if I could get 7 hours night.
I just bought charge 3 to track my sleep pattern (light sleep, deep sleep, REM). However, Fitbit app displays only amount of time asleep, aware and restless.  What is the issue? configuration error?
I woke up to go to the bathroom at night and the Fitbit registered it as awake so I believe it is accurate. Sleep walking? I have not considered this. From what I know I do not sleep walk... then again I wouldn't know. I downloaded this app called "Sleep  Cycle," for iOS and it also gave me almost the same results as the Fitbit did. I guess, I should visit my PCP and or maybe go to a sleep clinic to see what is going on? Needless to say I am shocked. I wonder if I have spent all of my life like this...
What are you doing to regulate your heart rate while you are asleep?
I have a CPAP. It's been life changing. Of note, I thought I would have to go to a lab to do a test like a lab rate. It was so simple...I was sent a device to wear one night that was so simple to set up that it was a non-event. Sent it back and found I was waking up 45-50 time per hour. Got my CPAP a few weeks later and am much less tired. Same sleep times, but more rest.
Thank Yarddog for the reply. Would be kind to please tell where to ind that tile? Sorry but I couldn't find it. Thanks.
Hi @Ari44  which Fitbit do you have? I noticed you've been asking people to be friends, but haven't told much about your fitness goals. As for sleep, how is your sleep tracking going?

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
Gymaddict20, I hardly believe sleeping longer would have automatically given you a higher score. This morning I had more deep sleep than since the scores started and more REM sleep than for a long time, awake percentage was about as usual. But the sleep score was only 70. (my average is 75), The only thing I can see that was different last night is that I spent more time than usual in bed (more than 9 hours) and got more sleep than ever (8 hours 20 minutes, whereas I set my goal to 7,5 hours and usually get less than that). I would very much appreciate if Fitbit could explain how they weigh the various results to calculate the score. It doesn't seem at all logical to me. Today I feel more rested than for a very long time, yet got a lower score than usual.
Was it a one-off event, or have you witnessed something similar over several nights? You can display the 24-hour HR graph for any given day in the mobile app. You may also want to restart your tracker.

I have a similar problem, yet different, in that it always logs 4 hrs in normal mode,(with sleep interuptions logged) bit I sleep at least 6-7 hrs. Starts me sleeping at 3am(I go to bed at midnight) and logs correctly that I get up at 7am. Records 96%. I think my HR is broken, tho my other stats seem to work fine.
I thought the HR would of knew your awake from your heart rate reading. Generally when your asleep your heart rate is lower than your resting awake state.

I think the Get out of bed tip really works for me! The empty the brain one... not so much. Meditation and I don't really get along well because of my ADHD, but I try! Clear your mind is simply impossible for me though! Hahaha
@Argali   As someone who has been tracking sleep since automatic tracking was introduced, I can confirm that the leading hour is included.  Sleep tracking isn't perfect.  Sometimes my sleep stages graph starts with me asleep, as if I fell asleep somewhere between standing and lying down.  Fitbit doesn't publish anything more specific than about an hour.

Sometimes I have to edit my start time because it misses the first portion of my sleep. But that should not affect data later in the night. To be specific this morning I woke up and had a hard time getting back to sleep and when I first looked at my sleep chart this morning it showed that time as awake. However when I edited  my sleep time to show that I went to bed a half hour earlier, that early morning awake time got removed. I hadn’t changed the end time. Can anyone explain that error?  I was definitely awake as it first noted!
Melatonin in small doses of 5 mg should do the trick. Or try a Jennifer Aniston movie. That outta knock you out real quick. Or record the next Democratic debate. That one will sure to make you pass out quicker!!!
Hi, I have my phone synced to my daughter’s Inspire as she is ill, and I need to keep an eye on progress or problems. Around 8am, I synched, and got all her sleep info, including restoration, REM and deep sleep, and time slept vrs time awake. She went back to sleep, so I re-synched at 8:45am. All the info disappeared in the re-synching, and Inspire gave me only a simplified version of her sleep, with no REM’s, deep, restoration etc. This is really frustrating, and has happened more than a few times in the couple of months I’ve been tracking. Maybe consistency is too much to ask for in a cheap watch, and I need a better model?
1. How much deep sleep does your Fitbit say you get, on average?  2. Would you say you are generally in good health and sleeping well, or not?  I recently saw a rheumatologist who noticed my Fitbit and asked how much deep sleep I got on average. I said it was about 45 min, and she said this was incredibly low and would be causing various symptoms. I came home and looked up how reliable Fitbits are when it comes to sleep stages. According to a study, well, there are many things that Fitbits track well, but apparently they're way off when it comes to sleep stages. I never thought it was like a sleep study, I just use it as a general guide. It does give me some idea of whether I had a good or bad night, and of whether meds or actions I take make a difference. I'm now curious as to how much deep sleep everyone else's Fitbit is saying they get. I have a Charge 2, if that makes a difference.
Open the app.  Go to the dashboard.  Open the Sleep section.  Tap the "+" sign at top right of screen.   On drop down screen, select "Begin Sleep Now".  And the other good news is the Droid DNA now syncs with Fitbit One after Kitkat upgrade!
Hi All, I noticed sometimes when I first sync my versa 2 in the morning I will get something like 3 hrs and 40 min sleep and a score of 63.  And I know I slept better than that.  Then I resync it and it goes to 7 hrs and 10 min and says sleep score 73.   Just curious why this might be?

Is it possible that you are looking at the wrong day? I do that sometimes. Or How close are you to other people? Do you live in an apartment? I have sync'd up before when I walked by someone elses base station (when I had an Ultra) or when I was within range of another person's computer with dongle (with the One). I call it a drive by upload.

I have been trying to improve my sleep for a few years now. By improve I mean, more hours asleep, more deep sleep, and going to sleep quicker. For most of my life i have struggled with going to sleep - I struggle to switch off my super active brain. I have used The Headspace App and another one I forget the name of that has sleep stories and they helped enormously, but I eventually found the noise irritating, so started doing relaxation exercises in my head instead and am finding it has really helped. The one thing that really increased my deep sleep was giving up caffeine. I never drank coffee after midday, but when I gave it up almost entirely (I still eat some chocolate! ) the amount of deep sleep I get magically improved. I rarely feel sleep deprived these days unless I am stressed by something and it is WONDERFUL!

I have the opposite problem.  Usually, if I end up awake in the middle of the night, my Fitbit thinks I'm sleeping when really I'm laying awake in bed trying to fall asleep.  My heart rate is probably low enough and I'm still enough that it thinks I'm sleeping.  So my sleep log will say 8+ hours when really I probably only slept 6.   And this has been the case across all different Fitbit devices I've used.  I've thought about switching it to the more sensitive sleep setting to see what results that might yield.

Heather | Community Council | Emerald Coast, FLWant to discuss ways to increase your activity? Visit Get Moving in the Lifestyle Discussion Forum.
My Luxe records similar numbers and lengths of periods awake during the night. I usually spend about 7 to 8.5 hours actually alseep per night according to the app, and time awake ranges from about 45 mins to 1.5 hours, waking between 20 and 40 times a night for brief or longer periods.  Those periods occur throughout the night, but are also more concentrated around the hour or two before I get up, which makes sense as I tend to wake at about 6 and then drift in and out, snoozing until I need to get up. So, in short, I don't know if it is normal, but it matches my experience.
If you wear it on your non-dominant hand and the app reflects this setting, it's more sensitive and will pick up steps more easily to compensate for the idea that a non-dominant hand will not move as much as a dominant hand. If you switch it to your dominant hand, but leave the app setting for non-dominant hand, you may pick up even more movement. Wearing it on your dominant hand and switching the app setting to reflect this reduces sensitivity for steps (I've noticed that as I move while I sleep, I wake up with less "added" steps if I wear it on my dominant hand). Try giving that a shot, it could make your fitbit less likely to interpret movement during the night as always "light" sleep.
I’m a little late to the party, but am having the same or similar issue, and wondering if you learned anything new on this since the last update. Did restarting your Fitbit resolve it, or have you talked with your doctor about it?
A quick search on Google:A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats a minute. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats a minute.
Hi. Just curious if this is typical, weird, concerning, or what... I've been wearing a Charge 2/3 for almost a year now, and have noticed a common pattern for myself. I will often have a dip in HR just after laying down, but then my HR goes up for a couple hours, often 10-15 bpm above my RHR, then will gradually come down, stay lower for the last half of the night. So, if my average RHR is 70, my HR will be about 65 when I first lay down, go up to 75-85 for the first couple hours, then will be 60-65 for the last half of the night. It seems like my higher HR correlates to my deeper sleep, which I thought was backwards. FWIW, I don't typically have sleep issues, get about 7-8 hours per night, wake once or twice (usually pretty briefly) and am of fairly good health. I don't snore or have daytime sleepiness that would indicate any apnea issues. I wouldn't have thought anything of it, except that when I wake during that early part of the night I can tell my heart is beating a little faster than I would normally think it should during sleep and that is what let me to notice that pattern.

I've tried everything on my tracker to try and get a proper sleep graph but it's not getting a consistent heartbeat when I sleep so only get a simple graph!! Its only worked a few times but recently not at all!
I have to say, I'm impressed with my Charge's ability to sense when I've gone to sleep. I've taken two naps in the last 5 days or so, and each time it has caught them and logged them. Today's was just over an hour, and another one was much shorter. I consider that pretty cool. Thanks!
Is anyone else having problems with the Flex?    I am on my 4th one since 11/14.    They just stop working on me.  Will not charge, will not sync and will not do anything.     Support has been good about getting back to me and replacing but what happens when first year is up?    I did not pay $100 for it just to have for a year.@stephanie77 wrote:I have a question.  Which I am sure has been aske before so here it is again.   I have the fitbit charge and I gave my husband my fitbit tracker.  So here is the thing I don't always use the sleep tracker part.  My husband lately has been tracking his sleep patterns lately.  How do I keep from his patterns from showing up onto my information?  Thank you for the help in advance.
Mary, I do the same thing and I think this is the easiest. My problem is when I bump my arm during the day, my band will go into sleep mode and I don't notice. The next morning it shows that I was in bed for 16 hours.
Hi everyoneive been trying to attach a screen shot but not sure if it’s possible?I almost always fall immediately into deep sleep without any light, and immediately to sleep on going to bed. I usually wake up after about 1hr 20 for a little while then have a lottlemore deep sleep. After midnight or so I have mainly light with some R.E.M. but no more deep sleep. I’m always exhausted and I’ve read otsmore common to have light sleep when first falling asleep.can anyone shed any light on this or if it’s a cause for concern?
I agree.  I have never gotten sleep stages.  I’m thinking my Blaze is too old.  I’ve had it maybe 3 years.  It shows it couldn’t get a consistent heart rate reading.   Really every night since this feature came out.   I get 5 or y hours of sleep.  Most nights my battery is at least 1/2 charged.  It’s on my wrist the same as it is all day long.  I give up there’s still a glitch in the software.  Maybe I just need a newer device.   My app and blaze are both on the latest versions.
I find I can track naps by using the 'begin sleep now' and end sleep buttons, and set the time on my Versa for 30 minutes.  But remember begin and end sleep are not recommended for overnight sleep if you want to get sleep stages.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Hope this helps! All I did was uninstall and reinstall the App on my phone and it worked again! Good luck!XSent from my iPhone
Mine just started doing this and I've owned it less than two weeks. Did you figure it out?
I just got my Fitbit Monday and I noticed in the sleep part it doesn't log anything on the "time it took to fall asleep".  Does anyone know how to fit this?
I also use Sleep Cycle. This app is no more and no less accurate than Fitbit's sleep results. If anything, the HR function should give you more reliable results. I have a Flex, and if I compare its sleep tracking with that of Sleep Cycle I find that they are very similar as both are solely based on my movements. Sleep Cycle might pick up on some body movements, when I don't move my wrist on which I wear the Flex, that the Flex might miss, and the Flex might pick up some different data when I move my wrist without moving my body, but overall, they are almost identical.What Sleep Cycle does is link the non-movement bits and the movement bits with curves. This gives your sleep pattern the appearance of a more gradual transition between light and deep sleep and periods of awakeness. Probably in addition, it uses some algorithm to try and decide whether you're actually awake. This algorithm might be based on the duration between movements and the fact that the "normal" sleep cycle lasts about 90-110 minutes. So what the SC graphs show is based on a lot on assumptions. They often show me in the light sleep phase when I was actually wide awake and going to the loo. They always show me as waking up gradually - due to the curve -, when this is often not the case (noisy neighbors waking me up whether I'm ready or not). The Flex shows me going from being asleep to being suddenly awake - which generally corresponds more to my typical wake-up experience. 😞Fitbit doesn't use curves and only displays spikes when it detects movement. It doesn't try to read more into the data. This is actually more accurate than the Sleep Cycle curves. Although I sometimes just get "restless" when I was actually awake, it doesn't show me as being asleep.So due to the curves, which run through light and deep sleep levels, SC might look more precise or detailled, but it is not. Since it is purely based on the detected levels of movement, it cannot be more precise or detailled.With the HR function, the Charge HR should actually be able to give more reliable info on your deep, light and REM sleep than SC since your HR should be the lowest during deep sleep. You might even be able to identify REM stages, because during REM the heart rate raises again close to your resting HR, but is often more variable than that. Without HR information, trackers might easily incorrectly identify REM sleep, where the brain and other internal functions are more "awake" than during light sleep, as deep sleep because the body is practically paralyzed during REM and no movements would be tracked by the devices.Without electrodes measuring your brain waves during sleep, there is - at least not yet - no way to reliable distinguish all your sleep phases.The only thing that Fitbit does not do is to allow you to set a flexible alarm based on your light sleep. But I think a request for that feature has already been added to the suggested features list.
Has anyone seen any sleep graphs like this? I'm wondering if this is how a chart of someone who has sleep apnea looks like. (I wake up extremely tired and I am fatigued all day)Here is a few different days.Night 1:
Heart Rate for night 1 Time Asleep 
Night 2:Time asleep Heart Rate for night 2 (These are normal nights for me)
 
Here is my oxygen variation for a couple of nights as well.Heart Rate 1 Heart Rate 2

Hi. I wish to monitor his sleep because, although we manage to put him to bed early, he shows some signs of maybe not sleeping enough or at least not having a restful sleep. One of the reasons is the fact that he tends to get his nose stuffed frequently so I was going to monitor his sleep as we try different solutions (hypertonic water, nasal corticosteroids, etc). The graph that the Ace 2 gives me seems to be ok (meaning it tells me how much time he was restless and how many times) but I just thought that if a Versa would work too I would get a better insight into his sleep.I understand that, for the time being, the only watch that is suitable for a 5 year old (meaning, with a suitable sleep algorithm) is the Ace 2. Right?
My Fitbit 4 has stopped giving my sleep data/time. For last week it is saying I am getting 1.5-3.5 hours of sleep a night. This is incorrect. I restarted, uninstalled/reinstalled and chatted with an expert on here and set my setting to “normal”. This is the only reason I have this device as I have a sleep disorder. I also pay for premium. If this isn’t fixed soon I am cancelling premium and using it as a watch. I can’t believe anything it tells me anymore. Hope it’s fixed soon.

From fitbit. "How does my tracker automatically detect sleep?All of our wrist-based trackers automatically detect your sleep, meaning you just need to wear your tracker to bed. After you sync your tracker in the morning you'll see your sleep information on your dashboard. To track sleep with Fitbit One, see How do I put my tracker in sleep mode?Autodetection is based on your movement. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep. Morning movement tells your tracker that you’re awake. If you’re not moving but not asleep for long periods of time it’s possible for your tracker to falsely record sleep, in which case you can delete the sleep log from your history.If you track sleep with Alta HR, Blaze, or Charge 2, Fitbit uses a combination of your movement and heart rate patterns to estimate your sleep stages. For more information, see What should I know about sleep stages?"
Hello @fallingup13. Welcome to the community forums! @JohnnyRow Great to see you around and thanks for your input! 
 
@fallingup13 As mentioned on JohnnyRow's post, wear your Fitbit device to sleep and when your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep.

I don't either. I did for a while and although I found the tracking data interesting, I didn't find it useful and now prefer to give my wrist a rest and save a little on battery power.

Hey. I just got the charge 4 but for sleep it says it doesn't detect pulse during my sleep and therefore I cant see the detailed REM data etc. Im on premium and during the day pulse works fine. any ideas on positioning of the fitbit on my wrist?
No, I got it to track just one time. Every night I tap it a couple of times it flashes two lights twice, then it flashes 5 lights. I have repeated 5 to 10 times but no luck.
I have the fitbit alta hr and up until a few days ago it would calculate my sleep patterns in 4 stages light deep and awake rem and show a chart  but now it just says awake and sleep ...Help
I don't know what the % means, because it doesn't take into account the length of time it took you to go to sleep, only what happens afterward. I will post mine as an example- even though it took me well over an hour to get to sleep, and I awoke many times, with a short overall duration, it said my efficiency was 73% for a very poor night's sleep. I was in bed for 6 hours, and slept only 3 of it- to me, that's 50% and not 73. I would say less than that, because I didn't get enough TIME in to really make it a good, restorative sleep at all.  It's a number I won't be relying on, because it's not very useful.
HiThe graphs seem to be working ok now though I'm not keen on the change ofcolours but I'll get used to it.So far so good thanks for asking 😊
For the first time I didn't receive a graded sleep score and I'm really unsure why. According to the info page on why I may not have received a score I needed at least 3 hours of sleep and to have my fibit (I'm using an inspire HR) on securely. I wore it the same way I always wore it, I use a specific notch in my band every time. The battery as of now is at 58%. I know it read my heart rate all night because the BPM graph charted all night. I also have a full night of sleep data;Asleep for 5 hours 16 minutes12:42 bedtime, 6:38 wakeupAwake: 11%, 40 minsREM: 24%, 1h 24mLight: 42%, 2h 30mDeep: 23%, 1h 22m I've only had my Fitbit about 2 weeks but these are far and away my best numbers. I look forward to checking the number each morning and both number and feeling wise I think this was the best sleep I've received since I got my Fitbit. My highest score is a 72 and I feel like I would have cracked a higher one. So I'm a bit frustrated that on the night I had the best numbers I'm not getting a score and I can't find a reason why I didn't get one.
I love to have a peaceful environment to sleep in. Having no electronics or distractions is very important to me.I'm also a huge fan of wax melting lamps (safer than candles) with a scent that I only use in my bedroom, that way my brain associates it with rest.And although it's not always easy, I love to have my bedroom clean and organized. I sleep so much better in a room with no clutter...I'm sure there's some psychological reason for that, but taking a few minutes before bed to declutter really helps me rest well.I've also tried supplements and while I don't think they do any harm, I still think environment is key for me.
I have seen random information on the website suggesting that fitbit readings are lower than what a finger SPO2 monitor would show but in my case I am trying to figure out why I was diagnosed with sleep apnea where my O2 drops into the 80s but the fitbit shows my levels to be between 93% and 97%. Any insight? I mean, I feel better on the nights that the number is higher so clearly those are nights where I have less episodes of not breathing or I don't pause as long but I still need a cpap.
Indeed, that is all so clear and simple, but unfortunately, I always break all these rules. That's why I always have problems with sleep, especially in nowadays situation...
Hi everyone,  Tomorrow I will be taking a redeye flight about six hours long. Then, a few days later, I am back on the plane, but not taking a redeye. I will likely attempt to sleep a little bit as this flight will be longer and later in the day. Anyone have any advice about how to get the best sleep I can while on the flight? I know airplanes suck in general for sleep but any help would be appreciated! 

Proud owner of the Alta and Aria.Have a book or blog to recommend?
Well you obviously just add the two together and get something over 100. Good job.  If it were only that easy. I got up this morning and my Charge 3 showed that I had only gotten about 4.3 hours of sleep, and gave me a sleep score of 63. Kind of got me bummed out. I felt tired and thought about just going back to bed and then showing up at work late. But I powered through on my normal schedule. Later, just a few minutes ago, I looked at it again. The sleep score is still 63 but the cumulative time is now adjusted to 6:11. And the graph shows the added sleep time. Not sure how that happened, but it seems more accurate with what I experienced last night. Kind of wonky if you ask me, whatever that word means.
Hi everyone! 
 
I hope you're doing great! 😎
 
Do you know that sleep problems constitute a global epidemic that threatens health and quality of life for up to 45% of the world's population? 
 
Sleep is one the three key ingredients to a healthier, longer life (the others are diet and exercise). Many of the ways to increase the quality of your sleep are easy to do.
 
Here are some top ways to improve your sleep hygiene and get some 😴: 
 
Develop a routine: 
 
Set up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches.
 
Skip the booze: 
 
Your body needs to experience all three stages of sleep — light sleep, the REM or dream state, and deep sleep — to fully repair and restore itself. Please don’t turn to alcohol to calm your nerves or help you sleep. Alcohol may help you fall asleep, but it traps you in the lighter stages of sleep.
 
Avoid heavy or spicy foods: 
 
Heavy and spicy foods may give you heartburn or other digestive issues, thus affecting your ability to get and stay asleep. As for sugar, studies show it’s linked to restless, disturbed sleep and may possibly affect hormones that control cravings.
 
A light snack before bed “is acceptable,” according to the National Sleep Foundation. It recommends munching on a handful of nuts; a few cherries (which are high in melatonin); a banana (which contains muscle relaxers potassium and magnesium) and decaffeinated teas such as chamomile, ginger and peppermint.
 
Dampen sound: 
 
While you’re dealing with the blue light from your smartphone, go ahead and turn off any work alerts (no Slack or email pings at 2 a.m.).
 
Better still, just charge the thing outside your bedroom.
 
If you live in a noisy, urban setting, playing white noise or running a fan in the bedroom might help drown out any sudden noises that may startle you from your slumber.
 

 
I wonder if anyone has experience any inconveniences to sleep after eating a heavy or spicy foods? 🤔
 
If you have any additional comments or inputs, please feel free to share them in this thread. I'll be so excited to read them! 😊
 
I'll be around.

My Hrv is much lower than I would expect... Between 17 and 27 and yet I read for my age should be at least 50.I also have low resting heart rate of about 50.Does anyone else have a low Hrv and low heart rate. I have the fit charge 5, not sure how accurate the hrv is.Any comments are appreciated

I recently purchased a Charge 2, with the primary purpose of recording my sleep patterns.In the first instance, I am quiet disappointed with the sleep tracking functionality:1) Sleep stages does not work; and2) The sleep data is inaccurate. I generally find myself being in and out of bed quite frequently, on account of insomnia issues. Last night during a period of around 1.5hrs, I recorded approximately 300 steps and 2 flights of stairs, which is accurate, as I was awake. The corresponding time period for the sleep tracker indicated that I was either asleep or restless. It does not appear that there is any integration between the activity and sleep recording functionality. i.e. Generally, I'm most likely not sleeping, whilst recording steps, and definitely not sleeping if I'm walking up and down stairs. Additionally, Laying or sitting still, whilst awake, is being recorded as being asleep.
I've been tracking my sleep patterns with my Charge. It correctly told me the time I went to bed and when I woke up and noted how many waking minutes and type of sleep for a week and then we set our clocks back last weekend and it's been messed up ever since.The day we changed the clocks back it said I slept over 20 hours when I really slept about 8. Now it's telling me I'm awake longer than I'm asleep after I go to bed which isn't the case at all.Is there someway to reset my Charge so it tracks correctly?
Do not use "Begin sleep now".  Just let Fitbit figure it all out itself.I guess that option is just meant for trackers without heart rate monitors that just rely of sensing movement.I hope that gets you better results now.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Ideally, getting up for bathroom, should just log as a normal awake period during the night, assuming it is not too long.  If too long, could be broken into 2 separate sleep sessions.  "too long" - I have no idea what that time length is.

Sleep mode can be tricky. It needs to be taunt against your skin. Five rapid and firm taps puts it to sleep. It buzzes, then two lights slowly fade to nothing. To check if it's still in sleep mode, tap and see two dancing lights. In the morning, tap five times firmly and it buzzes and a single light shows when tapped. That light is to show the daily goal progress. Any tap when awake is to tell you your progress - one light for each 20% of your goal. When you sync the next time, it ought to log your sleep. click to read about sleep tracking This link is to the Flex area where you will find the manual and related articles - click

Hi @writergal28,That's interesting. I find that when my RHR is lower, I tend to get more deep sleep, not less. We have a big sticky thread on improving deep sleep that I hope may give you some ideas about how to increase it.

I think the problem is you have to move around for a couple of minutes after getting up in the morning.  If you just sit up, and take your tracker off, it has no way of nothing that you are active, and to end the sleep cylce. That's why I suggested opening the app, and it would manually end the cycle.  I don't see a way around it.  You need have to be active for a few minutes...

I also have a flex and it does show bathroom trips as awake but I walk a few more than 10 steps. One trip showed as 4 minutes awake. It also shows awake as I do wake about the same time each day but on my days off I will simply go back to sleep for an hour or so and don't use my alarm or fitbit alarm. Eerily it seems to track quite accurately. Did check my settings and mine is for a 12 hr sleep tracking as I don't turn in before 12pm, normal sensitivity and non dominant hand if that helps. If you know what the restless times are attributed to I wouldn't be concerned. I think you can leave notes on your tracker so maybe note them for historical purposes if you are working on improving your sleep. It is glaring to me to see how little I really do sleep and I definitely need to get more hours in. Also, it may correct itself. I have only  had my flex since Christmas, tracked sleep accurately first night than didn't. Learned I could log hours in and did show my sleep time. Then started auto loading again. Mine I seem to need to tap numerous times to go into sleep mode, more than 5.
I wonder the same thing. I went to bed and was reading for 45 minutes before actually going to sleep. My Fitbit recorded it all as deep sleep! I've also had it record sleep (but without stages because it was less than 3 hours) while watching a movie or quietly reading.
@max71 thank you for sharing this link. It looks great, we might have to hurry with this one: Sleep Challenge. I think that in that way we can improve our sleep.

I start it when I am ready to turn out the lights (stop reading) and go to sleep.  Otherwise, I'm not gettting an accurate reading of sleep time and real sleep (without awake and restless time).  I have found it's easier for me to use the App on my smartphone to click "go to sleep now" than try to manipulate the flex band into a sleep mode.  When you wake up you just have to click the "I'm awake now" button.  It will do the same thing if you do it on the flex (tapping repeatedly) or just clicking the App.  It's easier for me to do it on my phone than mess with the flex band.
Don't worry about the restlessness or the periods of time of being awake. The Fitbit tries to track as accurately as possible, but naturally you'll be moving throughout your sleep, so it's fine if you have these in your log. It's really just there to try to help you gauge how much time you are resting while asleep, and according Fitbit, resting means no movement at all. I wouldn't be seriously concerned about this unless you are actually waking up and are conscious of the times that you are.

Hi Kevin -There’s more to OSA (Obstructive Sleep Apnea) than just heart rate. I’m not sure how strong the correlation is between heart rate and AHI (apnea-hypopnea index, or number of time my airway is occluded per hour). For anyone, an AHI of <5 is considered normal (scary that even normal people stop breathing up to 5 times/hour), but heart rate isn’t part of that calculation; my CPAP machine reports my AHI (I went from 92 down to about 2 after I started CPAP) without monitoring my pulse. What I did notice is I woke up way fewer times using CPAP, which is something the FitBit will tell you. Like I said in my original post, if you’re waking up a lot during the night - and if you snore a lot - then it’s best to get checked out by a doctor to have it diagnosed correctly. Get Outlook for iOS
Yes!  I was wondering about that too.  However, it may be because there is a sleep update they have started which theoretically is supposed to give us more accurate stats on our sleep such as: light, deep, REM, etc.  That being said, my tracker did not give me that info this morning so I intend to contact support to find out why.
@SunsetRunner yikes - no one wants those kinds of Fitbit dreams.. only step goal celebration dreams!
 
While we only replace broken trackers with the original type of tracker, I definitely recommend reaching back out to us via email, phone, or chat so that we can take a look at your replacement Charge. Sorry for the trouble - we look forward to getting this taken care of!

Hi Willow, Great news! What do you attribute your good night of sleep to? Also, if you don't need an alarm do use it. If it's for work well I guess it's better to be safe than sorry. If you are sleeping through the alarm that means you aren't getting the sleep your body needs. I have yet to have a night when I sleep through out the night without waking up. Your efficiency is great 99 percent. How did you feel after that night of sleep?  The only thing I noticed is that you took quite a while to fall asleep. It takes me about 10 to 15 minutes.I have low cortisol levels which probably affect my waking up early on a daily basis. Regards
Today I saw this from FitBit: Most people went to bed between 10:20 - 11 p.m.Most people fall asleep within 8 - 11 minutes.Median times awakened 8 -11.Median time in bed 7.5 to 8 hours.Median actual sleep time 7 - 8 hours.
What's the most deep sleep you've ever recorded?
I am new at Fitbit. I started out wearing my Fitbit on my left, non-dominate, wrist. I just changed to my right wrist and will be looking forward to seeing any changes in my sleep reports.
It's set and has worked for the past month & then suddenly this week it won't go off yet the settings show it's still set.  Anybody know why this could be happening?  I reset my alarm to change it by 5 minutes to see if this resets it...
I experienced this last night for the first time. I am researching now.  Will update my reply when I find an answer.
I take melatonin (liquid) sometimes, and that usually helps me fall asleep, but I am sensitive to it and often feel groggy the next day. Much more groggy if I take gravol, though (which I don't think should be used for sleeping, anyway). What are your favourite...getting-ready-to-sleep tricks? 🙂  

	“The game is afoot.” ― Sherlock Holmes, Adventure of the Abbey Grange
I’m not sure about fitbit, but I got a Garmin Vivosmart 3  and just about a week into wearing it to track my sleep, I started having very vivid dreams. Normally, I don’t have any dreams I can remember. Now, these dreams are turning into very stressful nightmares. I think strongly that it has something to do with the device. I will try not wearing it for. And see what happens.
I'm having the same issue. It worked fine for the first week, now 3 weeks later it is only displaying vertical lines despite singing up for Fitbit premium. Is it possible that manually beginning a sleep session is interfering with the detailed display?
Thats the third week in a row my sleep averaged 06:05 (06:05, 06:07, 06:10). I've always stressed that i should get 7,5 hours of sleep. Which seems my body is very resistant to. It rather sleep four or 12 or 3 or 7. Weirdly enough, after getting the fitbit i found i sleep calm and the end average is always 6 hours. Maybe i'm trying to hard? Maybe i should reduce my sleep to 6 hours? Maybe the long sleeps is what makes my sleep unstable and my mind tired? What are your experiences for best sleep lengths?
How do I know my baseline is neg better than positive
I have mij fitbit charge 4, 1 week. After 5 days my sleep score and stages also disappeared.
I hope someone can answer this as I have the same problem except mine is stuck on sensitive and I cannot get it to change to normal.  Thanks
I dont remember, i will try it
That looks very nice. Thanks for sharing.

I couldn't sleep for the first two nights when I had my Charge 2 to monitor my sleep. From third night, I took it off, then the sleep back to normal. Didn't try it again.
Years ago I had a Zeo.Big problem was that it required access to their website to show results.They seem to have gone out of business and their website no longer exists.I think I still have the Zeo sitting on a shelf somewhere. I probably should recycleit.
On Monday March 27 to my surprise I woke up and see my app had changed to this ...  I was in love with it! Then today I wake up and find it was back to the old way! Why!?I want the new way back it was way more informative !
Man, i tried to find a forum post that was related by searching but could not find one. Thank you very much for the reply!
Right. That is why I am asking if the app is different for people with trackers that DO log sleep. If you read my question, it's about a post describing sleep logging in the android app, through a menu item I do not see in my up-to-date version of that app.
My efficiency rating is typically 92 - 95.
I'd be really interested to see what your efficiency is when you set the sensitivity to normal. The sensitive setting is for very heavy sleepers which clearly at <50% you are not.  Do you have a set sleep routine?The aim for poor sleepers is to 'train' the brain to associate a pattern of activites and ideally a time with sleep - eg  brushed teeth, dimmed lights, reading etc.Also you should avoid electronics such as TV, tablets, computers for at least 1hour prior to attempting sleep. The bright, artificial light they produce fools the brain into thinking it's day time - ie; time to be awake!  I know in this day and age that can be the hardest thing; it means missing your favorite shows &  last facebook check-in and returning to hard copy books to read before bed and if you have the luxury of 95% efficiency like myself these things dont matter.But from living with a poor sleeper and having to seek medical advice I know for a fact that these changes can make a world of difference.  Oh and remember be patience - you are retraining a lifetime of bad sleeping habits - it takes time 🙂

Or maybe I'm doing something wrong? I suppose it doesn't really matter. I just felt like there should be a way to have both.It seems "minutes to fall asleep" was a casualty to the new sleep stage model. It also no longer specifies "restless".  Some people who'd rather know time restless over sleep stages, have disabled the HR monitoring to force the old sleep categories. For now, we have to choose one over the other.

Mine seems to be working now so I wouldn't give up. Someone suggested (and it seems to help) this: when ready for bed, first tap twice to get normal logging mode dots, then tap rapidly several times until the two dot sleep pattern appears. In the morning, repeat in reverse. First tap to get sleep mode dots flashing, then tap rapidly to get into normal mode. Sometimes this takes a couple of tries. It seems important to have the flex recognize the current mode b4 changing it. Hope this helps you as it did me. I also changed the sensitivity in settings in my online acct and now wear on my dominant wrist.Sent from my iPhone
Same here honestly!!
The fitbit says that I woke up 20 times last night.What is considered waking up? Is that opening your eyes or elevated pulse or just rolling over? I'm not sure how that is measured.
Thank you Colin.  I did as you suggested and it worked great.  Got much more detail.  As you can see the acid reflux event was long and uncomfortable.  What bothers me is that my heart rate was so high for so long and I didn't even realize it.  Thats longer than when I run! Does nothing for sleep of course.  Also I can tune in the time and get even more detail and a better estimated length of event.
To answer your orginal question, no, the FitBit data was not used as a derterminated in having my sleep study done. My complaint that I didn't sleep at all is what triggered it.Which is sad. I had taken multiple surveys with every surgery and hospitalization about my sleep, and every time the doctors said I had sleep apena, yet the PCP never sent me for a sleep study to confirm it. Another doctor had me take home an oxygen sensor, but the stupid thing kept me up all night and so never recorded a drop in oxygen, so my apnea wasn't confirmed with that study. Then I developed severe insomnia, and my PCP finally ordered the full sleep study, with a split night- first half withou the CPAP, 2nd half with. At first, my insurance wouldn't pay for a sleep study. We switched insurances and finally I got my sleep study. IMHO, that should have all happened years earlier! Now that I have a CPAP machine and am seeing a sleep specialist, to answer the 2nd part of your question, YES, he wants to see my sleep logs every time, along with notes on what I did for hygiene each night (what meds I took, other steps I did to try and sleep better, etc) to help me determine what helps and what isn't. They do take them seriously. Finally, if you think you have apnea, make an appointment to talk to your doctor about it. Be proactive and insist on a sleep study. Yes, take your logs with you, but be persistant if you are having trouble sleeping or staying asleep, or if your sleep isn't restorative or effective. The PCP can only prescribe sleep meds and make general recommendations for sleep. And while you can research a ton on sleep on the internet, and it's mostly good advice, it deals with the insomnia portion only. The apnea diagnosis and CPAP machine only comes from a sleep study- for during your sleep, they play with the pressure levels on the machine to see what pressure of air you need to stop your apnea events. The machine, type of mask, and settings are all very specific to your type of apena, face, and sleep pattern (mouth breather, only nose breather, etc) that they observe in the first half.  Hope this helps.
Thanks @PieChi, @dan801, @BrianUK for posting here. The new Ionic is going to have o2 monitoring that should help identify sleep apnea. But it's great to see that the sleep stages charts are giving good information for this also. If you do have sleep apnea, please post a screenshot of one of your sleep charts here, so we can all benefit from the comparisons.

I have Restless Led Syndrome and I just started tracking my sleep patterns with the Flex. It is amazing! Not my sleep pattern, but the fact that this device tracks my "awake" periods and my "sleep" periods to the minute. I can share this with my doctors AND with the other people I know who have this disease. If there are any others out there who would like to start a group, please let me know.I also track everthing else. I am very active and would love a challenge or 2, or 3...... CW
Hello everyone I had the fitbit ZIP and IN DEC 2014 last year.. and then in Sept 2015 this year I lost it at somewhere so I will be back soon... life go on have a great weekend

He/she is comparing against "the benchmark" (3rd option for display of sleep stats).  I am not a sleep expert but as long as you are not 100% more I would not worry. If you are CONSISTENTLY much more awake than what is average (50% - 100% more than benchmark), it is time to wonder. Also note that it doesn't track (if auto-sleep detection is on) how long it takes you to get into sleep. But you can force manual sleep and that should provide more insights, many people have a problem getting into sleep.
Fitbit Charge 2&3 provides a great capability to capture sleep data. The grouping of  sleep data into  fields will help users learn what impacts sleep.
I've been off FitBit for awhile (since late December) and starting to pick it back up. In the past I haven't really had issues with the sleep logging and lately I have been having the same problem that's being discussed here. I've been putting it into sleep mode when I go to sleep and taking it out when I wake up. Sometimes it syncs and sometimes it doesn't. I can't be bothered to remember what time I fall asleep or make note of what time I wake up. It just seems like a hassle to have to go into the app to log it. (Sorry, not trying to sound whiney...it's just disconcerting when something that has always worked fine doesn't work anymore). Anyone have any answers as to why this is or any solutions? If I have to start logging it into the app, I will but I'm just saying...
It's not even the firmness or lack thereof -- the sleep number bed allows your body to float pressure-free all night, so that the sleeper isn't changing positions in order to give the body rest.  I agree that it must be the mattress that's been causing the tossing and turning.  And it did take some getting used to -- having the fitbit watch on my wrist, but I'm getting used to that.
@mikeyyc I'm happy to hear that you're loving Fitbit Flex and you go nowhere with it ! I appreciate the details that you provided me about differences that you noticed.  I would like to explain you how Fitbit Flex tracks your sleep when it's in normal or sensitive mode, normal sleep tracking counts significant movements, such as rolling over, as being awake. The Normal setting is appropriate for most users.Sensitive sleep tracking counts nearly all movements as being awake. It is best for people who have sleep disorders or those who want to closely analyze their movements while sleeping.Whichever setting you choose, if your tracker is worn consistently in the same place with the same setting, the data it provides should be useful in helping you analyze your sleep patterns over time. If you would like to know more about sleep tracking go Here

Hi @maryalice46, I'm no expert, but it sounds like a good thing. It would indicate you don't have problems falling asleep. What does your benchmark show for REM for your age and gender group? That's a good way to check.

Hello everyone! 
 
I'd like to know if you consider that exercising 2 hours before going to bed improves Sleep? If so, which type of exercises do you recommend?

Hello @lucy1080, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for the information! 
 
It is recommended to wear your Fitbit device in a snug wristband while sleeping. I can't confirm if placing your wrist under the pillow interferes but it might be preventing your Fitbit device to get a consistent Heart Rate reading.
 
Additionally; there are some factors that could prevent your sleep stages to not be received or your sleep data to be inaccurate: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
Hope this helps!

Your standing (at rest) heart rate should be 10 to 15 beats higher than your lying down(at rest) heart rate. When you stand up your heart has to work harder (pump faster/spike) because most of your blood immediately goes to your legs. Your heart doesn't have to fight gravity when you are lying down. The average resting heart rate is 60 to 80 beats per minute. According to the American Heart Association, the best time to measure your resting heart rate is in the morning, before you get out of bed.  Questions:1. How old are you?2. Do you have any cardiovascular risk factors or history for heart disease?3. What does your heart rate do when you exercise (bicycle or treadmill)?4. If you are older and your heart rate remains high even when you are barely moving your legs then see a cardiologist.5. When I was on the bicycle starting to working out my heart rate would immediately spike to >110-120bpm and no matter how slow I pedaled I could not get it down. This was my only symptom and I finally had a treadmill test only to discover that I had a >90% narrowing of one of my coronary arteries and needed a stent put in. I am >50 years old.5. If you are still concerned put your fears at rest and see a cardiologist.
Oh man, I'm sorry to hear about your patchy sleep but I'm glad you find the Fitbit helpful. The sleep feature on the Fitbit was one of the main factors in my own decision to buy one.  You can always search or add a suggestion (like a breastfeeding option) to the Feature Suggestions forum at https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/idb-p/features  Take Care!
It is still doing it....
I don’t have and answers for you, but your situation sounds somewhat similar to mine. My BP stays around 90/60 and until this pregnancy, BPM stayed at 55. No health problems or concerns, not an athlete by any means but have always had the low blood pressure/heart rate.  I fall asleep quickly most nights - my husband hates it but as soon as my head hits the pillow I’m out. If I sit still for a few minutes, I fall asleep or start to doze off. The sleeping while moving thing is different, never done that, my hr does go up a bit with movement. I was just looking for anything on here related to deep sleep patterns and if it’s normal for someone to immediately fall into deep sleep, so I guess I’ll keep watching this post to see.
@gypsyrose85  My sleep pattern is restless and it's usually not even in the 60s percentage wise. For me, having a radio playing helps me rest better. Everyone should have a bedtime routine that helps them relax before they even get to the bedroorm. Maybe a nice cup of hot chocolate or hot tea would help relax you and prepare you for rest. Welcome to the forums.

Hello, I have had my fitbit blaze since November 2016 and it was working fine. Since the past 4 days I have not been getting sleep stages. I tried restarting my device, and tried every solution mentioned in the "why dont I see sleep stages today?" section. Can somebody help me with this. Thanks
Hey Newbee, I have sleep apnea (which means i normally dont sleep well) and I score a 90-100% in this area, this make me wonder how accurate this part of the device is. Do you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night?Do you find yourself not feeling refreshed?Do you wake up with Headaches? if you answered yes and have these symtoms normally then I would talk to your doctor, maybe your not sleeping as well as you think. if not then try the fitbit in a different spot (ankle, arm, pocket) see if this gives you a different reading. Let me know if any of this was helpful, Have a great day!

For MrsProck:What you are describing can occur in narcolepsy. Have you ever had a sleep study (including both overnight and daytime napping in one study) to check for it?
I agree, information is maybe available, but it is so spread through swipes and clicks that it's very hard to track it down. I would prefer instead of having a 7day window that I drag left and right to give me an average, to have them in a 2nd bullet style. Daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. Where yearly means that I can select February for example and show average asleep time (already implemented - free in 2nd bullet), average REM, deep, light, awake (you can manually move the 30-day window to February - Premium feature.....otherwise it's 7day window - in 4th bullet), but average fell asleep and wake-up time are not showing anywhere (they are calculated by Fitbit and statistics are being made (see last picture from 1st post), but are not shown). As for the features already requested, it's very complicated to implement this kind of functionality out of 10-15 smaller tickets. It would be great if anyone takes it as a whole. In the meantime i'll try to create another feature request to include fell-asleep and wake-up time in 2nd bullet statistics. Thanks!
Hi.  Did he give an indication as to what causes the high sleeping heart rate?  I too have this and just had an in home sleep study that ruled out apnea.  Thanks!
I couldn't agree more @iamlionheart - stressful days = sleepless nights for me too.

@Hemp wrote:This is about my 6th or 7th Fitbit (they don’t last long, my last one not even 6 months, very poor quality but I like them). Thats weird I used my first fitbit ChargeHR from end of 2014 till I bought Surge in June/July 2017 and both devices worked perfectly. ( ChargeHR battery with heart track on all the time still had battery for 3 days+ ) I switched to Charge 3 in December 2018 since I found Surge a bit to big for my taste.
While I understand some people may prefer to see a 'Sleep score' I much prefer to see my weekly average of hours slept. As a shift worker it was great, if my weekly average was 6 hours then I would try and aim to sleep longer the next few nights to catchup and try and get my average up. Now I just have a score, I could manually calculate my average but I shouldn't have to when Fitbit used to do this for me.  A score might be useful for some but I don't see any benefit.  At least give us the option in Settings to have sleep hours or sleep score, or why not show both?  Rather than just remove something give us the power to remove it if we don't want it.
You're talking about two different things: sleep history, and last night's sleep.For last night's sleep, it isn't necessarily updated as soon as you wake up.  Give it a while to at least be sure you are really getting up, and to sync.If it is sleep history you are talking about, on phone, tap sleep tile and you should be able to see your sleep history by date.  Is that what you are questioning?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

So the first night my sleep pattern was correct. Then the second and third night it's been 1 hour behind? So say I went to bed at 11:12pm and woke up at 06:51 it's registering that i went to bed at 10:12pm and woke up at 05:51. Would there be any reason as to why it is doing this please?
Yes that seems like a coincidence. My BPM is actually working on both the watch and App, which makes me doubt their reasoning.
I'll try to squeeze in a bit more time to rest, I promise @Gandhi!
I did set up an alarm on my Charge HR to let me know I need to go to bed.

I’m experiencing the same problem. I have the Sense. Today my breathing rate is missing. All other sleep data was successfully reported.
Hi @mar383 Exactly yes, provided that you first adapt to changing your sleeping and waking times.For a depressive person, it would be better to sleep 8 hours 🙂Good luck !
I just want to say i enjoy reading my sleep results and proving to my husband that yes i did get up 12 times last night to deal with a; dog that has to pee, infant who is sick, and a toddler who had a bad dream. No husband bashing here, he is deployed so he just gets to listen to me complain about not having sleep. Lets see how bad my sleep cycle gets. I also think, since fitbit has an option for pregancy they should have an option for breast feeding. since i get up at least 4 times a night or more. On another note i enjoy seeing how bad my sleep is and knowing that i can still function at work all day.

It works really well.  I had a jawbone, and that was my favorite feature.  The device died within a year though so I thought I'd give fitbit a try since I have trouble waking up in the morning.  It never occured to me that it's sleep tracking wouldn't have the same feature.
I showed 1 hr and 20 mins of deep sleep but the tracker had me falling asleep 2 hrs later than I did. When I move my start time back, the deep sleep dropped to 17 minutes and was at a different time. Why?
Oh God! That's exactly my problem too! I went to the Dr.  Got sleeping pills and didn't work at all! Went to a sleep specialist and he said "well.. Many people have your problem... There is no solution" 😭😭😭I wanna try to go to the sleep center in Italy: it's said to be one of the best in the world ... I we'll see 😔 I'm feeling hopeless
I was having the hardest time sleeping. I noticed on my FitBit sleep tracking that when I exercised/ did cardio after a certain time in the evening my restless/awake cycle went up drastically. I am still struggling with not wanting to jump out the door and go for a walk in the evening, but now that I don't do the cardio or walking at that time I noticed my restless/awake cycle is going down somewhat. I don't know if it will work for anyone else, but it's worth putting out there. Good sleeping everyone!
Has anyone else experienced an issue with your sleep tracking records disappearing?  My Saturday night sleep record just dissappeared before my eyes.  I have been tracking my sleep everynight and I check it each morning and compare with previous days.  I have seen that night for the past week, but today, it is gone.  At first it was just giving me wrong details...The stats were different than they were previously.  Then the next time my fibit synced, (it may have been a coincidence) the data just disappeared.  Before it disappeared, I had checked it with my daily activity and even though it said I had slept 7hrs straight with no restlessness, it had shown on my step activity that I had taken 54 steps at 4am, when the sleep log showed I was still a sleep.  This doesn't jive and now the entire sleep record is gone for that night.  My fitbit battery is getting low today and needs to be recharged...does the history get stored on the fitbit or on the cloud?  Any ideas, any others experiencing this?
Hi, just wondering if you have seen a change in your sleep patterns since you posted this? I’m a new Fitbit user and am getting roughly 30% REM.
my computer recently had a tune up and now I've lost all my data , My steps are not registering and no sleep  mode also I had to put in a different email address as the site would not accept my old one ..what do I do .Should I try to reset the whole thing and if so please give me some direction .

Seems like September. They announced it today.  Why you would announce a feature that people can’t use is beyond me.
Distance is calculated simply by multiplying steps taken by your stride length. As your step counts seems ok, the issue must be with your stride. Fitbit uses defaults for walking and running strides based on your profile settings (height and gender). If the defaults are in use then it's worth checking that your profile settings are ok: https://www.fitbit.com/user/profile/edit You will also see the stride lengths on this page - if they are zero the defaults are in place. If they are not zero then they sound wrong. This article helps you sort them out: http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/How-do-I-measure-and-adjust-my-stride-length/

I'm looking for the best sleep tracking device. As I have problems sleepping well. No sleep apnea or something like that, just some broken sleeps, lots of tension and it takes long before getting to sleep. And sometimes I wake up really quick. I want it to be monitored so I could experiment and find patterns/solutions. For example I would like to do some analysis whether my sleep is worse after going to bed later, after having a busy day, if it gets better if I dring a cup of tea in the evening, don't drink soda, etc. etc. I don't care about all other features of fitbits, won't gonna use it. Will only use it for sleep tracking. But that one feature is really important to me, it should be the best. Which fitbit is the best choice for me? Second question: what are your experiences with sleep tracking, is it very accurate?

Just make sure you don't overdo it. A few years back  I was taking it to reduce the number of migraines I was getting since it depresses nerve impulses. I accidently bought a higher dose than I had previously been taking without realizing it. It depressed my nerve impulses so much that I felt lethargic all the time and ended up gaining 20 lbs before I realized something was wrong. P.S. For food-based sources of Mg, realize that chlorlphyll is high in magnesium, so green things should be good for you.
I've been struggling to get to sleep earlier! Does anyone have tricks they use to get themselves in bed earlier? I'm in college and i do have homework a lot of nights but i'm never doing homework past midnight. Lately i've been struggling to go to bed before 2 a.m. and sometimes even 3! How do i reset my sleep schedule?
It's completely normal to not remember waking up or moving during the night cause it's usually for a brief period.I'm not sure what is normal in terms of how many times people wake up/move, but I've had my Flex for a week now and I average about 14 red spikes a night using the normal setting and I usually remember waking up two or three times a night. I believe it varies greatly from person to person...I think the more important thing is how you feel upon waking up in the morning. If you feel well rested, that is the most important thing in my opinion.

Sleep monitoring with any similar device is just a guesstimate since its based on how much the wearer is moving..... not brainwave patterns, eye movements, etc.
am in bed 7 hours or more and?it says I have only slept like 4 hours maybe less and waking about 15 times or more and all this?restless stuff. just wondering about all this I have the flex bracelet and now they want 50.00 a year to read all the grafts? didn't know it would be so expensive any ideas? got mine from target and haven't signed for the yearly fee yet. ?Barbara Purtlebaugh

Hi Elfis It's worth giving them a call. I think I was fortunate as it was the first thing they hit on. Mine has been fine since. Good luck. Will
Ironically the app is better on the summary but not on the break down.  I can't look at the detailed sleep of anything but the first sleep period.  However on the summary screen: You can see it's tallied up the details of the two periods:  If you take this into a weekly summary plot it gets the values correct as well.  It may be acting a little buggy still but for the most part it seems to work in the iOS app.  What behavior are you seeing?
Hi @QueenDSayers Under the actual individual alarm (for example,  6:00 AM alarm), you will find the option to turn on/off the Smart Awake feature. Please let me know if this helps!
That is very interesting and good to know about caffeine. Thank you so much for sharing @LiamMac
When you are writing your post, there is a toolbar along the top of the dialog box you're typing in; one of the icons on the toolbar is a Camera; click on that, drag the photo image into that pop-up, and click "Done".  🙂
Thanks for the update @Suzzi1961 .  I agree the Flex requires getting some used to, especially when putting it into sleep mode.  There were times I would have to keep tapping for like 5 seconds to get it to vibrate and flash between 1&3 lights and 2&4 lights.  Some nights it seemed like I was just pounding by finger to my wrist to get it to activate.  Best of luck.

How do I find an online manual to set up my flex sleep mode? I am figuring out pretty much everything else.Betsey
Might be able to use it as a starting point to get a referral for a sleep study, but overall, its probably not necessary. When you go in to for the study, they'll put all these seasons on your body and head, to get a very very accurate read out of your sleep cycle (whether you enter REM and for how long, etc...). They'll also monitor your breathing for sleep apnea.OTW, your pcp should refer you. I got to the point where I could sleep 12+ hours, then fall asleep two hours later, while watching the TV. Absolute fatigue. Went to a sleep study, and learned I had "the worst sleep wake cycle" my doctor had ever seen, and I got prescribed meds. This was all well before Fitbit entered my world, so I'm guessing if you have symptoms, your doc should refer you without issue.
I have a lot of those little red lines as well, but I do not think I have sleep apnea.  I'm often tired but I think just think I don't sleep enough--go to bed too late & up too early.  I also get very little deep sleep according to Fitbit.  7% on average, with many night registering less than 20 minutes of deep sleep.  But my average for "awake" is less than average as well, just 10% compared with a population average of 12-24% awake.
The font in the sleep category recently changed to something pretty difficult to read.  I can no longer easily see the time I spend in each sleep stage.  Why did this change?  Will it be changed back anytime soon?  I'd prefer not to strain my eyes from uncomfortable font.
I have a severe bruxism and use a bite plate at night. However my jaws are sore every morning. I am taking medicines as well with little help. I have tried shiatsu in cape town a few weeks ago and felt a great relief. I have also geard of efective acupuncture but have not found anyone in nairobi yet.
Hi @Alicat2104, What you're seeing as far as efficiency was from the old sleep model. Sleep stages doesn't currently contain that information. Depending on which tracker you have, there may be a way to switch back when you need it.

Hello,
 
The sleep Score doesn't appear anymore on ma fitbit Alta HR.
What shall I do?Thanks for your help.

Hi @Argali and thank you for sharing your problem. My best guess is that the leading hour is not included, as your watch will not be sure if you are just trying to sleep, or actually sleeping.
I feel like I have a good sleep and yet when I check my sleep in the morning there is usually from 15 to 20 restless shown, is this normal?  I put it on my daughter one night and she had just 2!  The quantity of sleep I get is fine but should I be concerned about the amount of time I am apparently restless, does anyone else have this?
For the last two days mine and my wife's fitbits are showing a Sleep Efficiency of 100% when clearly it isn't looking at the barchart. Is there a general problem?
Thanks!! Yes, that is what I am seeing also. I am waiting for a new model to come out before I upgrade from the One, I wanted to Force.

I understand differences in sleep sensitivity but this time is definitively wrong. I woke up at 8:06 AM. I checked to see how long I had been asleep and the end time was 9:20 AM. How can that be??? This is wildly inaccurate.
I am have a distorted sleep pattern and am only allowed to sleep from a specific time at night.Is it possible to set an alarm if you fall asleep before the set sleep schedule or specified time?
Hi all, Is there any way to export the precise start and end times of each stage of sleep? When I export the sleep data in XLS or CSV format, it only gives the general start and end times and then the total times for each stage. I would like to be able to export the beginning and end times of each stage. I like being able to track this in each day's graph, but I was hoping to get the raw data to try to write a script that could find patterns in the data, to try to predict when REM is likely to occur. Is there any way to do this? Any help is much appreciated. Thank you!
I posted a solution to a similar question. Please see this post.

Our thoughts about sleep and our sleep-related behaviours greatly contribute to insomnia. For more information, google the two terms, CBT and insomnia. Also, there is an interesting web site, cbtforinsomnia dot com. Another one is sleepio dot com. (I am not affiliated with either web site) CBT treatment for insomnia generally has better results than meds
Versa 3, with sleep setting on normal.So it's been a bit... temperamental recently, ending with last night saying I was awake for 80 consecutive minutes, which is totally incorrect.I've seen mentioned somewhere that you can edit the awake times, but not been able to find a working link.Anyone got any tips on this, getting it to work properly? (It's had a reset not long ago)+

Hello @hayppyboy Welcome to the community forums. 
 
Usually when you woke up in the middle of the night your Fitbit device will detect that you are awake and will end your main sleep recording. When you go back to bed it should start recording a different entry. This is expected. 
 
For more information about how to track your Sleep, please check: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device? Note that you can also edit your sleep logs in the Fitbit App. You can see for instructions in the link above. 
 
Hope this helps!

Thank you. That seems to reinforce my thought about the sleeptracker not accommodating people who wake in the middle of the night. Sleeptracker seems designed to work best (only?) for people who sleep through the night. I am suggesting the software be updated to allow for mid-night wake ups.
Hi @787Pilot I think this is an interesting topic for those of us that are 'road warriors' too. Traveling late afternoon and thru the night, to get to a very different time zone having zero time for jet lag, means there can be multiple days with little to know sleep. I'd love to hear from flight crews and other travelers.

Hi @Bartfliet - It sounds like it’s time to gather your data and make an appointment with your family doctor to discuss it. S/he would be better able to look at the data then decide if you should go for a sleep study. As lay folk, we are not qualified to look at your reports and diagnose sleep apnea. But from what you’re reporting, I’d say it’s a possibility and deserves a professional assessment.
I no longer have any faith in the sleep cycle information. The other night I put my fitbit on the charger and laid it on the desk.  I forgot to put it back on before going to bed and while it was on the charger it recorded an over 8 hour sleep, complete with the cycles of when I supposedly was awake or in deep sleep. So I wonder about the other things that it supposedly records while on my wrist.
Welcome to the forums! This is a good idea and I would add it to the features forum.Developers look there for ideas. If it gets the votes it could be addedhttps://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/idb-p/features I would then come back and post a link here so others can vote for it as well Hope to see you around!

Hi John,you have done so well to change your life. Who cares if you are not getting the zzz's you were used to when heavier. You must feel so alive! And its hard to sleep when feeling enthused and engaged. This too shall pass. Keep it all up and your sleep will fall into the place you need it to be.
Hi Betty,I dont have the nicest mattress so I am getting a new one delivered this weekend, and a new pillow. Lets see how that goes.
I went back to bed for 3 more hours and when I synched again VOILA! the entire night's stage graphing was there. I don't understand it but I'm relieved that it is showing normal readings again.
So I've had RLS since I was a child. I can remember getting shin cramps from moving my feet so much in bed. Everyone then told me it was growing pains, but the aching and moving continued well past puberty. My mother has it as well and is on medication for it. I however am stubborn and refuse to take the prescriptions. I instead take an asprin or rub on aspercreme. Those always help, but my concern is to not take too much. In one week taking an asprin a night is a lot. I do find that mine occurs in a pattern with barometric pressure changes and female related stuff. My fitbit shows me just how much sleep I lose to RLS and helps my friends and fam understand why sometimes I'm very ditzy throughout a day.
I always assure my patients that having a sleep disorder is not life threatening. Most sleep disorders are treatable with changes in lifestyle routines combined with herbal sleep aids, or prescribed medications.
The first thing is to figure out why you are having trouble sleeping.
It might be related to stress or illness. Sometimes patients drink too many caffeinated drinks or too much alcohol. Modafinil,  diet, or daily living routines may affect the quality of sleep. After medical problems are ruled out I suggest trying a few self-care methods that I have found to be helpful.

It is a bit more complex than that, a flare would usually send up my nightime heart rate but also my resting heart rate goes up. So since they both increase, so sometimes I still stay somewhat under (around 70% for example). But no need to have a big flare, sometimes just a bad day is enough. It also elevates through the day if my disease is active, I see it clearly.
For sure. I have a hard time falling asleep because my head won’t shut off, then I have trouble getting up. When I was really depressed, I was taking naps every afternoon, never in my life have I been a napper.
I finally got them to agree to send me a new replacement.  I am not very hopeful that this will fix it, since it is being mentioned by so many.  Think it is a problem with the platform, and not just a 'lemon'
How does my fitbit know how long it takes me to fall asleep ,when I wake, and if I am restless?
Hello @Dasypod, welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback! Please note that our team is always working to enhance your experience and your feedback is a big part of that process. Your comments are very important to us. 
 
On a side note, I want to let you know that there are some tips that could help to improve your sleep score in the Fitbit App. Here are some of them: 
 
To help improve your sleep score, work on your overall sleep habits, heart health, and activity levels:
 

Exercise earlier in the day or at least 3 to 4 hours before you go to sleep (source).
Maintain a consistent sleep schedule (source). For more information, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
Meet the CDC’s recommended 150 active minutes per week (source).

For additional tips on improving your sleep routine and quality, see How can I use my Fitbit device to sleep better?
 
See you around.

So I've always had problems staying asleep... I can't ever remember sleeping through all night. I got my fitbit at Christmas and have tried it with the normal and sensitive settings, to find the results are COMPLETELY different. I get sleep paralysis alot so thought it would be interesting to see how much sleep I was actually getting. My sleep efficiency on normal mode is 94% (and I'm still shattered), but my sleep efficiency on sensitive is 37%. On the sensitive setting it says I get no more than 3 1/2 hours sleep, and on normal it is around 8 1/2. Could someone please help me as to why these figures are so different? I wake up overtired everyday, it doesn't matter how much sleep I get (or think i'm getting!). Thanks, Ali
Welcome to the Forums, @Brollachan.
 
Thanks for taking a break from stepping and for sharing those comments. I think there isn't other way to edit your sleep time. If you already restarted your Fitbit, please feel free to write to our support team. They might have to take a look of this specific information.
 
See you around.

In general, I think reported fitbit-sleep is a useful approximation of restful sleep. But it's clear that fitbit-sleep confused deep relaxation exercise for actual sleep.
Great info!! Thank you!!
All good advice, @WilsonFitbit . I find the Fitbit Relax app can be very helpful at times like this. That, and meditation. Both help to clear the mind. My Tai Chi instructor told us to let the thought wander in but pay them no attention. It gets easier to do over time. It takes practice.
Without knowing which tracker model you are using, it sounds like you might be using the 'Begin Sleep Now' button.  Generally that is not required, and you are better off just letting Fitbit by itself detect when you are asleep.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Short sleep periods don't show as much data. I do see number of times awake and minutes awake.

My sleep logs often show me as "awake" while I'm in "REM" stage.  Any ideas what this means?
Funny! I just got a new puppy about two weeks ago and for the first 10 days there would be a 15 minute break in my sleep pattern that progressively got closer to my normal wake up time -- she seems to be getting better at holding it 🙂
Hi @skmsI'm not sure any of us know the exact formula. That's part of Fitbit's "secret sauce".  Personally, I take as much deep sleep as I can get, but too much REM isn't the best. I do know light sleep is important, though it's not emphasized as much as the other two stages.

Agree with @Odyssey13 it's always best to see your doctor if you feel things aren't right.

Hey there, @PeterT7! Welcome to the Family!
 
Thanks for sharing all those details in your post. As to your question about resting heart rate, it's difficult to say. I think it's best to check with a doctor to make sure it's okay. Are you having same readings lately? 
 
Looking forward to see you again in the near future.

I'm very fortunate in that I have no difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. There are nights where the entire length of the graph is blue until I wake up. I'm sorry if this makes you envious. 😕
My two cents: Since 26/3, my RHR has gone from 61, going through ups and downs to 65 and back down to 59 today. It's pretty spot on compared to before, but I tend to have slow fluctuations which have previously gone as high as the low 70's and low as the mid 50's. @OldBob3301It's a bit hard to compare the Fitbit to a chest strap since they use different technology for picking up your heart rate, but both of them are still based on algorithms that convert what they read into estimated heart rate.A chest strap will generally be more accurate because a) it's closer to your actual heart and b) it will try to pick up on every heart beat through electrical signals, while a wrist based monitor (like Fitbit) will read blood flow (further from your heart) and does so through optical heart rate sensors that illuminates your skin and picks up on changes in light absorbtion. Both devices can also be less accurate if they're not sitting tight enough.As far as I know, Fitbit doesn't collect data as frequently as chest straps, making it less accurate than a chest strap during workouts with varied intensity like HIIT. While they may have changed the algorithm to calculate RHR (I don't know if they have), who's to say this isn't more correct than the previous?

Try again. Fail again. Fail better.
Hi @astair - Certainly several wakeful periods at night could possibly be caused by sleep apnea, but there are many reasons that this could happen. Many of us are just light sleepers and awaken during the night for no particular reason. If you are regularly not feeling rested after a full nights sleep, you might want to discuss with your doctor.
You're right; it does not make any sense that it should radically change sleep estimates from several hours earlier. I too question the legitimacy of this sometimes.  For instance, last night it says I had a 32 minute block of time with straight deep sleep. Then, immediately following that it says I was awake for 11 minutes, which I don't see any way how that can be right. Awakening from deep sleep produces more sleep inertia than any other sleep stage, as it's the hardest one to awaken from. I know when I've been awakened (or more appropriately startled) out of this stage, as it is known to cause a lot of disorientation. I did not experience that last night (although at some point I did wake up abruptly out of a vivid dream, but that would have been from the REM stage).
I have an Alta HR and a Zip that I wear as a secondary one when I don't want a watch on my wrist.This morning, my sleep log said something like 8 or so hours, showing me falling asleep at 12:04am and waking around 8:30. In the app it showed all my sleep stages as normal.I just got home, having switched to my Zip this morning when I got dressed, and my sleep lot changed. Now, it's showing I woke up at 10:30am! And I absolutely did not. It also no longer shows the sleep stages, instead showing the sleep log like my old Alta did--just restless or awake.It makes no sense why it changed completely the *type* of log and added 2 hours to my sleep that I didn't get. It absolutely showed correctly earlier today. Also, 10:30am isn't even the time I changed from the Alta HR to the Zip (which was earlier in the morning), so I don't see how that's the culprit.Any idea what happened? How do I get my sleep stage log back from last night? Thanks!
Hi.I believe fitbit has been trying to remove the advanced sleep diagnostic service from the charge HR/charge 3 devices. They want consumers to pay a premium price for that service.I understand that they want to charge a premium…but when I bought my device the advanced sleep diagnostics were part of the deal. You don’t get to change the service post consumer purchase in my opinion. I think the “update” was programmed to kill the advance sleep diagnostic program. That’s what happened to me. My third charge HR device has now failed.I am switching to Garmin.Best of luck with your device…Murph
Have you looked into respiratory problems? My partner has severe allergies so whenever there's dust, perfume or the day is too cold, etc; that nose is definitely closing up. Breathing through the mouth or squeezing in an inhalation from a clogged nose may take a toll on you. 
 
Not only allergies, but sleep apnea is something that severely impacts the quatlity of your sleep. Getting a sleep study might be beneficial if this is affecting you everyday.

I had been able to delete my sleep log and then add a new one and it was showing up like the old one, but today, it just keeps flipping back to the new one.  If it wasn't ready, they shouldn't have put it out there.  It is so annoying.  One of the main reasons I kept my Fitbit when I got an Apple Watch was to track my sleep while I was charging the Apple Watch.  If they screw that up, it is goodbye Fitbit.

Sleep deficiency, like hearing loss, is epidemic in the U.S. Often, people feel that time spent sleeping is lost, or unproductive. This is a myth. We need sleep, which, as Shakespeare said, "Knits up the ravelled sleeve of care".Having said that, though, I think that the numbers bandied about are often simplified. One of the most productive, inventive, energetic people I've ever known got only 5 hours of sleep a night. But most of us do need that 7 hours or so.Myself, I have a medical syndrome that's notorious for insomnia. (Another sufferer told me today he only gets 2 hours a night, poor fellow.) I generally get 4 to 6 (better than it used to be.) -- and when I get 6 I feel vigorous and productive. But when I get 7 I feel like I can take on the world with my bare hands and win.In general, though, with my chronic sleep deficiency, getting through the days is an effort, and my health is probably not what it would be with better nightly rest.
Attached is screen shot of my oxygen variation from FitBit Charge 5.  What is it - per FitBit's suggestion - that I tell my cardiologist this is? Am I well? Do I have a problem? I'd rather know nothing than wonder what this may be indicative of. Please advise.
Thank you 🙂
@CAM345 - I’m not sure I understand your question. Do you own a Fitbit device or are you looking for advice on sleeping better? I’d be happy to offer a few suggestions on what helps me get a better night’s sleep:I do not eat or drink anything other than a nice cup of tea before bedtime. It seems to allow my digestive system to relax, as well as the rest of my body.Listen to soothing music before bedtime. I like soothing, gentle piano music. It helps ease anxiety. I won’t watch violent movies or sports games in the evening.Most of the Fitbit devices offer an app called Relax. This leads you thru relaxed breathing exercises. I usually do them to soothing music in the background. While doing this, I do not try to stop the anxious thoughts. I simply let them float over me, then out, as I concentrate on my breathing. I do this every night. The more you do it, the easier it gets.Hopes this helps.
@CaiL33t,😅 Oh my gosh, it got a scratch. Not stolen, not broken. But a scratch!I can personally relate :catlaugh:
Hi @Cas61 I'm sorry to hear you aren't seeing the sleep results you were expecting. If you were sitting for a long time not moving and your heart rate was relaxed, your tracker can misread that as sleep. You can go into the sleep setting and edit the record to get a better reading. I hope that helps.

Yes, frequently or if the REM in on target, my light sleep is higher. The only time I don't feel that I've slept well is when the deep sleepis below the benchmark.  It seems the only time the benchmarks lookperfect is when I haven't gotten enough hours in total.  On the days Ihave to be up very early for work I often don't get to bed earlyenough.  I only work 1 or 2 days a week, and I know the problem isgetting up later on my off days.  I've been trying to get to bed earlierevery night, but sometimes it just doesn't happen!--~(;;;)~ JanHow to handle stress like a dog: If you can't eat it or play with it, then pee on it and walk away.
Hello everyone. 😊
 
Have you experienced sleep issues due to Arthritis? 
 
Painsomnia, this is considered the inability to sleep due to pain and it is a major problem for people with arthritis. 
 
People with arthritis are more likely to have sleep issues and it is likely due to several issues. Your levels of cortisol, a hormone that helps control inflammation, are lower at night. Lying down can cause inflammatory chemicals to pool in the fluid that cushions your joints, which makes them stiffen up. And your perception of pain may be heightened during the nighttime because you’re not distracted by anything else.
 
But just because painsomnia is normal and common doesn’t mean you have to accept it. 
 
Here are some tips to make your bed routine more comfortable: 
 
1. Use a neck roll or towel: note that sleeping without proper support for your neck can place extra stress on your cervical spine's joints, discs, and soft tissues. With the rolled towel in place, your neck is better supported and aligned with the rest of your spine.
 
2. Get creative with your pillows: put a wedge behind your shoulders, a tube pillow under your knees and then prop up each arm on a firm bed pillow. 
 
3. Sleep with a thin pillow: to keep the neck straight, you can sleep with the thinnest pillow possible. 
 
4. Keep your room cold: Heat has proven benefits for helping keep joints limber and in less pain, but hot sleep is often restless sleep. You can focus on cooling your bedroom via an open window or air conditioning set to max.
 
5. Sneak in an afternoon nap: another way to give your body the rest it needs to manage your arthritis is to take daytime naps. 
 
6. Get exercise during the day: Exercise can feel like the absolute last thing you want to do when you’re in the midst of a painful flare but if you can muster the energy to do some type of movement, it may help improve your sleep length and quality. 
 

 
Is there anyone struggling with this situation? Do you have any tips or recommendations? 
 
I'd love 😍 reading your comments!
 
Have a great day!

The walk to my bathroom seems to be enough for Fitbit to know I am no longer asleep. Then I just leave my Fitbit on the bathroom counter while I shower.
I was in bed for 8 hours but only slept 5. How can this fit bit info help me sleep better?
None of the "z class" drugs worked AT ALL for me (Ambien, Lunesta, Sonata).  1.5mg of Xanax XR did, however, make a difference, so he just put me on a pure benzo-type sleep aid called Restoril (temazepam).  He said it's okay to combine with the Xanax XR if needed.  He also recommended a sound machine.  I found a terrific app called the Brainwave Dream Inducer, which I let run on my iPad next to my bed at night for about 5 hours.  The new combo seems to be working. Not everyone responds the same.  The Z-class drugs bind to different receptors than the pure benzo-type drugs.  Even though the latter are technically more addictive and come with withdrawl issues, you have to weight the risk with the benefit.  For me, every OTC medication, including Trazodone, makes me feel drugged as hell.  Ironically, the controlled substances make me feel the least drugged and the most refreshed in the morning.  Just my personal observation.  Everyone is different. P.S.  I usually only get between 5-6 hours of sleep.  I am going for a full 7 hours, that is my goal.  The difference in how I feel between getting 6 hours vs 7 hours of solid sleep is very significant.
I've got similar results to the above. Normal = 98% sleep efficiency Sensitive = 52% sleep efficiency(on Charge HR) Last night I was restless (the log above is last night), but log wise it was not any different other other nights that I'd of said I slept OK on. All I've looked at are 98/50ish% depending on sensitivity.
Great, I will remain optimistic then 😊 thank you
Thank you. I thought that my Fitbit Surge was accurately logging my workouts. If not, what's the use?
Ah, thank you! and my husband thanks you -a few times he was was facing my wrist and was woken!

@icarusgurl  Everyone is different with their sleep. I used to have more restless and awake moments before switching from sensitive mode to normal mode. Welcome to the forums.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
Do we ever see replies from Fitbit staff here? This thread has been open a long time. No official reply? Whats the point in discussing if they dont address any concerns or feature requests? 😞
I just got a memory foam pillow and I am sleeping better.  My husband said I no longer wake him up punching and rearranging my pillow, which I did not know I did.  The fitbit showed I was restless almost all night. Hope this helps.
Never mind I found it.  The little "block" icon from ad block was blocking (hiding) the edit button in the log.
Hi there Jonnyrow, thanks for that lolI had thought of that too but as I've finally just got my tracker working almost properly again, I don't want to "meddle" in case it mucks it up again!!
I have really bad insomnia.  Sometimes I will lie awake till the sun comes up.  Most of my weeks, I have an average sleep of around 3-4 hours during the workweek and 12 on weekends.  Still trying to figure out what is triggering my insomnia.  Part of it is work - I'm often working 15-20 hour work days 6 days a week and have been on edge for a while.  And the rest I assume is lack of activity and diet.  Now that my work/life balance is starting to get a little better, I find that diet is helping me with the sleep.  This is the first week I have had consecutive good nights rest in a really long time.  I find that drinking a green juice first thing in the morning helps me sleep well.  Strangely, doing a hard workout seems to keep me awake longer.  I will try doing a yoga instead and see how that works out.   I think the key here is - figure out what your body is saying.
Hi I can see my sleep results on my Google Pixel but on Fitbit it says sleep not tracked. Is this normal? It seems weird to have an icon area and then not do anything...
I can't usually sleep well untill my aunty told me about breathing methods. Breathing can help with so many things from stress to sleep. I know a website called smiling mind if you want to meditate. I needed a way to sleep and I guess this is how I learnt: My aunt told me that counting your breaths from 1 to 100 really helps and guess what it did  learnt to stay calm and to stop "thinking" in bed. Fitbit also help's with sleep it count's my sleep and I think that is pretty cool. I have the fitbit inspire HR. When you sleep do belly breathing. Put your hands on your stomach and relax (I tell ya busy day's are pretty stressful) breath in and out slowly and count your breath 1 to 100 like I said before. You should be asleep in no time if not all good you need to get used to it before it works super well it can also work quickly on the 1st time you do it. So don't stress keep calm and you'll be fine. "life is like a biycicle to keep your balance you must keep moving"- einstein
Jackie you sound like me - I get a very low amount of deep sleep - even if I take a sleeping pill - tired all the time - wondering if it's the fitbit doing this - I have the alta - going to see if it males a difference if I remove it at night@iJackie wrote:Hello! I've been recently using my fitbit charge to track my sleep and thought I had a normal sleep schedule until I've been reading other threads and started to get a bit worried if I should consult a doctor.  Here's a few pictures to show my sleep: http://imgur.com/a/pHy11 I'm not necessarily waking up through the night but my restless sleep counts (per night) can reach up from 10-25. I've been trying to get 8 hours of sleep but even if I'm sleeping for 8 hours, my actual time of sleep is never more than 5 hours. I wake up very tired and can barely function throughout the day. I've been avoiding naps for the past few weeks but I'm constantly very very tired. Any tips to get more sleep or how to fix my sleep?
Can you pleae explain why the readings are so totally different on the two different settings for the sleep.  With normal I usually have about 6 hrs with the sensitive setting I have about 4 hrs big difference, I'm confusedTIA
I'm between 4-10 times restless and 0-2 times awake and 96-99% efficiency. I do use a cpap machine. My wife says I move very little while sleeping while she flops around like a fish out of water. My sleep is very regimented since I found out I have severe sleep apnea. The cpap machine has made a huge difference in my life and if anyone is having  difficulty with sleep or fatigue during the day go see a sleep specialist.
Hi the sleep monitor and heart rate monitor has stopped working. The green flashing light on the back isn’t working. How do I reset it please?

Hello @Docwints and welcome to the help forums.  I can see that you are a new Fitbit user.  You don't say what model Fitbit you use.  You also say that you are putting your Fitbit into sleep mode manually.  There's a good chance that your Fitbit can set a sleep schedule -- in the device settings on the Fitbit itself.  This sets a regular schedule for your Fitbit to go in and out of sleep mode.  Even if your schedule isn't perfectly regular, you can still set hours that cover most of your sleep time.  Here is a link to all the user manuals.   You can find your manual and see how to make this setting on your Fitbit.  I have family and friends in 19 time zones.  Yes, 19.  I don't know what I would do without this setting.  Fitbit sleep tracking uses a combination of your wrist not moving,  a change in your heart rate and your breathing pattern to sense that you are asleep and to generate your sleep stages.  So it's more complicated than you think it is.

Could you tell me how much deep sleep your Fitbit says you get, and how much the sleep study said you get? It's only of basic use for tracking sleep. I still find it useful. It does show me my basic sleep patterns, and I can get an estimate of whether my sleep was good or bad that night. That's enough to help me see what effects medication is having, for instance. I never slept well after taking pain medication. I can get back to sleep easily if the cat wakesme up by pouncing around in the middle of the night, but I can't get back to sleep if my partner wakes me up when he's getting up for work, presumably as it's during a different sleep stage.
@Choreo It goes by movement. Probably when you are lying in bed and reading, you are moving about. When you turn off the light and lie down, you are much more still. Similarly, if you woke up, but didn't move - just closed your eyes and went back to sleep - the Fitbit will not know you woke up.
My highest is 95. I can't figure out how to share screenshots. I get 95 maybe a couple times a year. I average about 90 though scoring between about 88-93 with a few 94s. I was also wondering if anyone has got 95-100 because I don't know how I can optimise my sleep anymore then I have.
You should be aware that there's really no way of telling if a mattress listed online will be right for you. It's too personal an experience. Reviews could say the mattress is firm for them, but could be too soft for you. I purchased one online that reviews said was a good mix between soft and firm. But when it arrived, it was like sleeping on a rock. Returning a mattress online is no fun either. 😞 I'd recommend going to a bunch of real-life stores (when they're open again), and test out a bunch of mattresses. When you find a model that you feel comfortable with, then locate it online and buy that one.

Tried the herbal teas ... tried warm milk with vanilla (used to work like a charm), tried mild sleeping aids ... all of it.  It's the medication I'm on that causes the insomnia.
I have the charge HR.  I love it. I don't know why it wouldn't use your HR to track sleep... I just assumed it does... I would think it's way more accurate than the flex, but then I've never owned a flex.
Thanks! There's a lot of heart disease in my family. I'm trying to out-run my genes.  🏃‍:female_sign:

I know that my original setting was on "sensitive" and I was getting the same - about 3 - 4 hours "sleep" per night, and i have just changed my sleep sensitivity to normal and it's definitely more accurate looking in respect of restlessness etc.
I agree and wish to add, the typical sleep disrupting "brain activity" that is a result of sleep apnea do not necessarily show as movement activity, and are short lived, usually 3 to 15-ish seconds long. These "arousals" are differentiated from "awakenings" which usually take a greater whole body activation for typically a longer duration. Sleep science is a science, Fitbit is a consumer product based on a redcued aspect to sleep science borne out of a company in Ardsley, NY, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc. (AMI) who devised and patented the original motion detecting watch. The slew of consumer products do NOT use the same technology, but a scaled down, generalized version of it.
My sleep funktion has disepeerd, whst do i do
I have found that I don't see my heartrate on the fitbit app. I close the app by double clicking the home button on my iPhone and swiping up. After I restart the app I get the heart rate to show... this happens all the time , not sure why the Realtime heartrate display stops, but closing and reopening the app fixes this

I will probably start doing so routinely.  If your wrist is bigger, one of those nylon "cause" bands might do the trick. If all else fails, I guess they do sell replacements, but that would get costly$$
I figured it out. I didn't see all the tiny spikes at the top. But I cant delete this post now lol
Hy everyone, I'm 46 y.o. male, neck pain started approximately 7 months ago, a therapist told me that's called osteophyte, and that's the reason I wake up several times during that night. bone spurs are pushing on intervertebral disc that's the cause of the pain. That's the story. I do not have a fitbit yet, but if I purchase one will it save the all night history if I wake up every three hours or so, and sometimes do not even remember that. By the way, I would also appreciate it if someone with kind of the same issue recommend me a firm mattress...
I would never get out of bed then. Could also have competition for most REM and deep sleep also.  

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Yes mine too! Just started doing it. One is really handy with R.E.M, light sleep etc.
I think the standard is supposed to be in the 80s. 90-100 is marked as "excellent," so I think it's supposed to be those extremely good nights of sleep that people don't have near as often. If they made 100 the 'normal' amount of sleep, then they wouldn't be able to show when you had a REALLY good night of sleep. Though it does seem that they should bump it up a little seeing as how 100 is likely impossible without going into a short coma.
I love the ability of the fitbit to help me monitor my sleep habits. I am having one difficulty in that the wrist band for night wear does not "grip" itself in the closed position well enough not to fall off my wrist at night. I wonder if anyone has the same problem and if you have come up with a work around. Thanks, joro

In other words, REM should be displayed on the vertical axis below Deep and not above it.. unless you go back to sleep light before entering REM.... Thoughts?Mine changes from time to time, with no "standard" in going from one mode to the next.  Last night, for example, it went from wake to deep to wake to light to deep to REM to light to wake to light to REM, etc., etc., etc.  The night before it went from wake to deep to light to deep to REM to light to REM to light to REM to light, etc., etc., etc.   I don't find it confusing as much as a constantly changing sleep pattern.   The only thing that confuses me is the Estimated Oxygen Variation chart....
I have had 2 Fitbits..and Inspire and Inspire 2. 
I LOVE my Fitbits but there is a flaw in the Sleep Score aspect of the device.
It hardly ever rates a sleep score. I have called the help line ad nauseem, frustrating
both the techs and myself. It was a waste of both of our time. 
 
I bought the Inspire 2 specifically for the Sleep  quality and Sleep Score..I get the graph
but no score.
 
If it doesn't work on everyone they should tell you or tweek the product. Other than than 
that..really like it ..but honestly, disappointed.

I find exactly the same thing with me. Been monitoring my sleep for 2 weeks and on avg I am awake 15 minute 5x and restless between 60-80 times adding up to 31x a night. No wonder I am always tired even when I go to bed at 8:30 and wake up at my normal 4:50am for work. Kinda scary lol.
Hi @FaithyAnn personally I share your opinion and I will vote as well for the feature request that @SunsetRunner kindly suggested.On the other hand my work around for this as of now is to turn off quick view from my Fitbit app in my cellphone the last time that I check my stats at night and turn it on when I check my stats in the morning :), since the option is available in the app I find it pretty easy to do it. 🙂 
 
Hope you find it easy to do as well and can help you to continue enjoying the Quick View option disturbing your sleep. 😉

the problem is a combination of pillow mattress and the quality of fitbits sleep tracking.
Hello to you too! In my case, the problem was that I used the Begin Sleep Now option. When I stopped it just starts to work.  From this article about sleep stages: Why don't I see sleep stages today?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your device’s battery is critically low. I hope this helps! Regards
Hey everyone, I just got a fitbit from my wife for fathers day and I love it so far.  So I am checking my sleep data and the BPM while the hours I am sleeping and its interesting that the graph is up and down. It goes from 57 to 64-66. So I am wondering if that is happening while I am dreaming? Or is that normal? I would think that REM sleep would be a constant low BPM?  Thanks!
the total time asleep in my fitbit app is shown without the time awake during your bedtime. Why is that?  10-20% (Benchmark) awake is considered to be normal during your nights sleep. If the time awake during your night rest is not taken into account, it seems to be quite difficult to get to the needed 8 hours of sleep! Any input?
Some meditation before sleeping may help, especially if you are one of those person who seems to think about a million things when trying to sleep.  The one where you focus on your breath is a good one - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati. Melatonin helps but I'm fairly sure you build up a tolerance to it (even though the body produces this naturally), so I'd be wary of taking it all of the time. 🙂
@TheDoctorClara wrote: what should I do ? and does anyone else know my pain of being on graveyard shift ?I work a normal 8 hour day M-F and do two overnight shifts (F into Sat ) and (Sat into Sund), so I understand the frustration.  What's worked for me.1.

I've always been a restless sleeper.  In the morning, my husband is in the exact same position as when he fell asleep, whereas on my side of the bed, blankets and pillows are strewn all over the place.  One of the reasons I got the Flex was to track my sleep because, starting in 2011, I contracted pneumonia and have since suffered serious and chronic lung-related illnesses. I tested negative for sleep apnea.  After I got the Flex and tracked my sleep, I showed it to my pulmonologist at National Jewish Health (the undisputed top respiratory care and research center in the country) because there had been a question about whether my oxygen saturation levels were getting too low when I slept and the overnight pulse oximeter tests were inconclusive.  The daily sleep graphs on my FitBit app was but one factor in his decision that I didn't need more testing about O2 saturation levels while sleeping, and my lung doctor is absolutely, positively the best doctor I've ever had or, as I like to call him, the Roger Federer of doctors. I believe it's a useful tool, but even though my graph almost always shows a significant amont of restlessness, when I do sleep through the night, with or without sleep medication (which I sometimes need), I feel rested when I wake up ... well, I've never been a morning person, so I should say after I've had my first cup of coffee!
After a hardware replacement, several reboots and resets and all sorts of wear changes, my Versa STILL struggles to read my HR continuously, particularly during sleep.  Has anyone figured out a way to get the Versa to track as well as the Alta HR for continuous HR and sleep?

I don't think Fitbit has helped me sleep better and I so far the sleep stage data does not necessarily reflect how I feel on a giving day. I have been using a spreadsheet to keep track of my sleep data (time spent in each stage) and how I feel (mentally and physically) using a scale of 1-10, 1 feeling miserable and 10 feeling great. So far after one month I see no consistent pattern of how feel relative to the sleep stage data. I've had great days with good data numbers and bad days with good data numbers and vice versa.
I’m so glad I found this message board. The last two months I was correcting my sleep cycle and was sleeping better than ever. I decided to track it because I just felt that good about how I slept. But every time I sleep with my Fitbit versa, I sleep terribly. I just can’t get comfortable or stay relaxed long enough to sleep. I’m going to skip it tonight and see if that helps.
Have you found any rhyme or reason to your sleep? Mine is similar to yours and it's stressing me out a bit. I know in prior models you can change the sensitiviy mode but that doesn't appear to be the case with the Charge 2. Last night I slept a total of 6hrs 20min and got a total of 24min deep sleep I'm exhausted and I don't know if I'm really tired or if it's a mind thing "knowing" I only had 24min of deep sleep. This has been they type of sleep report I've been seeing since they rolled out the cycles. Is something wrong with mine? Is something wrong with me? I'm getting stressed over this. I wear it where I'm suppose to. Ugh, I guess really venting but hoping others have insight. Thank you! -Piglet612
What data from my charge 2  (1) is used to determine my sleep tracking; and (2) is used to determine the start and stop hours shown?
@Sithmaith1I think the concern with electronics is two-fold. As you point out the blue screens have been proven to have an influence on sleep as we keep producing a certain substance in our brain that keeps us awake. But there are also concerns for the electro-magnetic waves involved with electronics. @cgarcia4039I am not sure if it is also an option for other phones, but my iPhone has  a "night shift" which lowers the amount of blue light and makes the screen look more red. I use it if I want to use my phone shortly before bed.

Welcome to the Forums, @amandajwong. Sorry to hear you're having this issues with your health. This is a difficult question, since most of the people with this condition may sleep longer than normal, sometimes 11 or more hours a night, yet still feel tired during the day. Good thing is that you're taking care of yourself. You can always check with your doctor to seek more options if medication is not working for you. You can reduce the risk of hypersomnia by creating a peaceful sleeping environment.

I just bought mine yesterday, but my restlessness last night was 15x.  Although I was trying to get 8 hrs sleep, I actually was only asleep 3 hrs 43 min.  Restless 242 minutes!
Hi everyone-I also experienced too much REM and too little deep sleep. Since I had read that it can affect anxiety and depression I thought meditation might help, and I was right. I downloaded an app called Headspace, and have been using it approximately 5x a week. It has increased my deep sleep by several percentage points, blood pressure has also gone down, and have had fewer food and alcohol cravings. I thought meditation was a bunch of nonsense but as it turns out, I was wrong. It took at least 30 days to see a change and it can be frustrating at times, but the rewards are worth it.
Hi there, thanks for the input... I dont believe my HR inspire has that function.. which product do you use?
Don't know why it would be doing that, @protempore, since mine tends to be very accurate. Mine usually shows me a going to sleep within a few minutes of when I go to bed, and it usually shows me waking up within a few minutes of when I get up in the morning.   Check your settings to make sure that Sleep Sensitivity is set to Normal and not Sensitive.
@Dominique Yep, the 'times to bed/rise/fall asleep' and efficiency are a part of the Premium features on the Web Dashboard. 
 
You do get an average of your sleep time on the Fitbit App of your Mobile Device.  Here's an example of one of my old sleep logs. (Finals week at Uni! I'm sleeping even less now )
 

 
I am so jealous of your night's sleep! Even If I have time to sleep, I still can't do it more than 4-5 hours

A Fitbit moderator wrote a couple of months ago that "this feature has been rolled out to a small percentage of users". I believe roll outs have more to do with the region/country where you live rather than with the particular device you are using. But it’s possible it hasn’t been rolled out to everyone yet.

I work third shift means that I generally sleep from noon-8pm. I have tried on several occasions to adjust the app to accommodate my sleep schedule but it simply will not do it. I have tried several times. Help?
@YojanaFitbit Reason probably is that everybody is different and what works for some, won't for others. Life would be so easy if everybody worked the same way 😄
Maybe I missed the message yet I never saw anything about the sleep details being moved to premium.....what happened? AND especially at this time when I am tense and on edge with the Covid virus .....my sleep tracking was something that was useful Very disappointed....and jobless so any thoughts of moving to premium are long off...... So sad
I have a Charge 2 and for the past seven days it will only give me a basic sleep record. I to have searched high and low trying to resolve the issue. I have logged out and back in, never changed settings but checked them anyways. Going to call Fitbit and see if they have switch to needing a Premium Account to get the detailed record of sleep verses basic.
@daretrace2 did you ever find an answer to this issue you were having? I haven't seen this in the Community before. Thanks so much @Mrthekla for doing some user testing for our friend's issue!

Hi there, fellow Fitbitters!  Are there others out there who are worried about not getting enough sleep, because their Fitbit says they spend so much time being "awake"? Even though the sensitivity is set on normal, not on sensitive? I used to have the Fitbit Flex 2, which usually said I had been awake for +- 30 minutes every night - I thought this was a lot already. Now, my Charge 3 says I am awake for over 1 hour (sometimes 1,5h even)! That means I should be in bed for almost 9 hours in order to get my 7,5 hours of sleep. Not going to happen! It also says that, on average, I only get +- 8% deep sleep, whilst that should be somewhere between 12-23%. I usually spend above average in "light sleep" and way above average in "awake". REM is about the same, mostly.  I'm kind of worried. I know I don't move that much at night, so I have no idea why my Charge says I'm awake all the time. Does anyone else experience this or does someone know how to solve this?  Thanks so much & have a great day!

Yes, I can't find that sticker, either. When I click on my make--Alta HR--I get this link. So where am I supposed to go from there? https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Alta-HR/bd-p/altaHR
@j30, As a workaround, if you turn Heart Rate to OFF before sleep in the settings, it will force it to use the old sleep model.

Health advice is certainly sound and needed. But I think that you have already checked your health and there is no problem, if you are here. So let's look on the other side. How about physical activity in the daytime? And even better in the evening before going to bed? You put on body lingerie harness and your husband will not mind being awake next to you. And then you will sleep better.

Not at all.  Very disappointed in the tracking.  Not very accurate determining when I go to bed or fall asleep.  Not to mention saying I was "awake" during the night for over an hour.  Even with the disclaimer "you may not realize/remember you were awake", I don't think it is properly tracking my sleep.  Started using the "Sleep Now and I'm Awake" feature just to get some accuracy into it.  May turn it off completely.
I agree.   I don't want to pay an extra £80 per year (£8 per month) in the UK as i am only interested in the sleep analytics and that is 2/3 of the cost of the Charge 4.   I'd pay £1 per month, but don't see why it isn't included in the basic app anyway.
When I wake up in the middle of the night, I try to lie very still and breathe deeply and relax. I do that to fake out my Fitbit and make it think that I'm still asleep, so I'll get a good sleep score in the morning. After a few minutes of doing that, I usually fall asleep again.

I posted this somewhere else in another convo but will post it here as well. I was very freaked out from the "sleep efficiency" stats.  As far as I knew, I sleep really well.  I always get 7.5 to 8 hrs sleep each night and feel that I wake up 0 to 1 times each night.   My first 5 days of having the flex it recorded that although I was in bed 8 + hrs per night I was only getting 3-5 hrs of sleep & efficiency was at 46%-73% waking up 6-13 times.   I honestly thought something was wrong with mine and was going to take it back and exchange it for a new one. Last night I figured out I had it on sensitive mode and have now changed it to "normal" mode.  It said that my sleep was at 96%.   I think that is much more accurate.  Im not sure how there is such a change.  It could be as simple as I sleep with my arm under my pillow/behind my head and maybe it hits my headboard.  Who knows.  But I dont think that "sensitive mode" is very accurate or realistic at all.
There is a journal on the Log part of your Dashboard. You can use that for any notes you wish to make, so you'll remember later on. You can also go back and add something, too. I know it's not the history, but it would help you remember later on.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
I have only had mine 3 days and been looking at the sleep analysis. It shows "Time to fall asleep" = 0 Min.? I lay in bed for usually 1-2 hours and read or watch TV before turning out the lights and trying to go to sleep so how would it know when I have decided to go to sleep and actually fell asleep? It says "You went to be at 12:04 am", but I was actually in bed at 10pm, but did not try to go to sleep until about 12:04am... how does it know this??? I cannot figure out how it knows when that transition occurs? Why does it not think I "went to bed" at 10pm when I was in bed? Also last night I woke up 5 distinct times that I remember and it recorded 2? The night before (as far as I know) it was right on. I am just curious how it "knows" when these things are happening?

Fitbit charge 3 firmware version 28200001.88.11 fails to track sleep accurately after update. We've reset the user data and rebooted to the smiley face. Can we doo anything else?
I think the comment above was a good one. Some of the newer sleep studies, particular for apnea are much less expensive and basically involve you picking up a monitor, hooking it up and sleeping at home, returning it and having a tech look at the read out. Gives a quick-n-dirty apnea eval.  I did the much more involved sleep study and was told "you are a light sleeper, everything wakes you up" No jike, thats what I told them! Thankful for insurance on that one.  You might try something simple like the pain reliever of your choice before bed and see if that changes the pattern. If it does then discomfort may be keeping you awake.  Then perhaps look at a mattress topper (tempur pedic style) far less $$ than the etire mattress. Again (said it before on here) my current sleep aid is 10 mg of melatonin (OTC) WITH an antihistamine (Zyrtec for me) lots of folks like benedryl (keeps me wired!)  along with ibuprophen for the aches and twinges of 'old' age. Worth a try and pretty safe in the drug department. Try it, check your sleep pattern. Ya never know.
How many miligrams do you take for magnesium? I've heard it can work, of course it all depends on how your brain reacts, and I've been wanting to try it. In the past year my migraines have calmed down to really bad headaches, very bad trigger signs but no migraine, and the occassional one that keeps me up. If it helps with sleep then I really don't mind trying it.
Thanks
What is a healthy number of restless sleep episodes. Is 100% sleep really attainable? Should I see a sleep specialist if I consistently have over 10 restless episodes per night when sleeping 6- 7 1/2 hours.
I would recommend that you talk with a doctor at a sleep lab about your Fitbit results.  After not feeling rested for a long time, and waking up a lot, I decided to get a sleep lab done. Dicovered I have sleep apnea which makes me stop breathing as many as 100 times per hour. Pretty scary! I am using a CPAP machine now which helps some.  Interestingly enough, my restlessness happens in the beginning and middle of sleep cycles and it's not until the wee hours of the morning, about 2 hours before I have to wake up for work, that I get the more restorative sleep.  However, I wonder how much of this restlessnes has to do with my 2 cats who enjoy sleeping on and near me? 🙂 Spoiler (Highlight to read)
As the subject states. I work nights yet all my data is scewed due to my sleep habits. Is there anyway to fix or alter that or receive the data of other shift workers to compare?
I've been using a CPAP machine for a few years now and just recently got a FitBit.  I'm wondering if there's a way to sync the sleep data from the CPAP with the Fitbit, it'd be nice to see any correlations.
I think its great fun. I've just had a score of 93.for 8hrs 48m day before scored 92 for 6hrs 45. I constantly beat my wife's score.
Thanks, I've been trying to figure out how to fix it when I accidently bump my fitbit and it goes into sleep mode
The RHR's on my wrist Fitbits are very accurate. I wish it were when you exercise. But importantly we are seeing a measurable advantage at the lower activity levels. When I tracked it through our winter I found extra garments had a measurable effect and this extract from this link  ExtractA reduction in heart rate for a given intensity is usually due to an improvement in fitness but a number of other factors might explain why heart rates can vary for a given intensity: Dehydration can increase the heart rate by up to 7.5%Heat and humidity can increase the heart rate by 10 beats/minuteAltitude can increase the heart rate by 10 to 20%, even when acclimatisedBiological variation can mean the heart rate varies from day to day by 2 to 4 beats/minute

I'm somewhat of a restless sleeper, so if I'm awake I'm usually tossing and turning, and the fitbit picks that up. It's probably best to just account for the misinterpretation. I always go by how I feel over what an app says. The sleep tracking is really good for spotting longer term trends. The only other option is to be more restless. 🙂

Of course, mattresses play a huge role in a good night's sleep. Because you spend about 30% of your life on a mattress. Furthermore, mattresses affect the health of your back, which is why people who sleep on bad mattresses are more likely to have back problems. I used to have a bad mattress, which caused me to have poor sleep and back pain. I decided to see a chiropractor for pain treatment. My friend advised me to go to adriameduae.com, and for a good reason. This clinic employs professionals with high qualifications.

I love fitness and fitbit pushes my cardio, which is just what I need 🙂  How senstive is your sleep feature? I have mine as quite sensitive. I might change about with it to see what happens. Hi @Hats26 thank you for sharing.  Well, I think the biggest misconception about people in fitness and athletic industries is that fitness is not an issue as much as it is for people in not so active industries.  It can be true in some ways, in other ways it's still the same in that we all have busy lives, personal issues and nagging injuries can get in the way etc. Joining a walking, running club can be a great way to establish structure and accountability.  I think that's great 🙂 I do like the sleep feature very much, I am always very big into rest & recovery.  Afterall, if we are tired throughout the day it becomes very difficult to put the energy necessary to train.  I have my sleep sensitivity set on Normal.  If you change your sensitivity, let me know how it responds differently.   Thanks again for sharing your experience.

Hello @Birdman19820423, welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thank you very much for your feedback and suggestion! Sleep score can't be turned off or removed but your input is very appreciated and I'd recommend to post this idea in the Feature Suggestions board so our developers can take it into consideration for new updates. Our team strives to improve the Fitbit experience based on our members feedback. You can learn more about how Fitbit decides what suggestions get released in our FAQs. 
 
On a side note, if you experience any inconvenience, take into consideration that you can post it here. Also, to get more information about Sleep score, please check: What's sleep score in the Fitbit app?

No worries. Sleep stages from Fitbit were often associated with the release of the Alta HR, which I think caused some to mistakenly believe the Alta HR had more updated technology. Basically, whichever tracker you can wear comfortably so that heart rate monitoring is continuous without dropouts, is going to give you the best results.

Well I do take melatonin because I tend to be sleepy during the day but feeling super hyper and productive at night. I currently have a general schedule of waking up at 2pm and sleeping at 4am. I guess it's not a big deal. Just worries me sometimes that maybe I shouldn't be sleeping so much. If I have to get up for something I'll make sure I get at least 5-6 hours. I lead a rather lax life right now though since I'm waiting on visa things and I have no children or animals. Just me and my work at home bf.
I don't know of any "good reading" on resting heart rate. I drink my chailatte with expresso every day. I also drink 2 cups of tea during the day.So my caffeine consumption is consistent. My resting heart rate stillfluctuates between 71-74 with a rare spike up to 76 or down to 69. I thinkthe spikes have more to do with an anomaly in the tracker. My monthlyaverages are consistent. I haven't really monitored my water intake to seeif that changes anything.
Hi Emmy,Sleep apnea is the question for me, and the blood oxygen level associated.  If there is a large variation (and I think you're correct that there is not a specific measurement on the y-axis--only a relative variation) I check heart rate to see if its elevated.  At high variance, there could be less oxygen absorption. Looks like a good tool, but is approximate.
The SP02 watch face is not mandatory to have the SP02 reading.. I don't have the watch face installed and I get the readings (although it take few hours to appear in the app). Instead the BR simply doesn't work.
Last night, I was asleep for 9 hours and 36 minutes and awake for 50 minutes. The goal is set at 8 hours. However, my time asleep score was 47/50. I’m trying to understand how much time asleep is needed to get 50/50. I would imagine that if the goal is 8 hours and I went over the goal, then time asleep would be a perfect score, right? If not, how long should I sleep to get 50/50 for “time asleep” score?
I agree with mechanesthesia, fitbit needs to address the way it calculates sleep.  I have worked in the IT field for over 30 years and this should be an easy fix for their programmers.
Your sleep efficiency is better than mine. I am a light sleeper, set on sensitive, non-dominant hand and get under 75% most of the time. Here is one thread where we were discussing it - click

There's a heart rate alarm option? Where?
For me it seems to have increased as well, but it is hard to pin point as I also struggle with anxiety and had a few attacks that coincided with the data. However, the RHR does not seem to come down to the level it used to and today it even spiked while feeling really good and the graph also showing lower RHR, yet the number given is higher than I expect. I did not receive the new sleep stages yet, but I wonder if it is related to the new firmware update.

@fortislander80 That's a great question! Perhaps you can set a silent alarm. Choose a specific time during the night to remind you that you have to go to sleep and another one in the morning to wake you up. You can program them for a difference between 7 or 8 hours, the recommended time for a good night sleep.  Keep in mind that it's not just the time you sleep, but the sleep quality between those hours. If you don't move all night for 5 hours it is possible to get 100% sleep efficiency. Or you can sleep for 10 hours and you may move around all night and feel tired when you wake up with a 85% sleep efficiency. Have you had a chance to take a look at our Feature Requests board? We welcome and encourage user feedback of all kinds; please feel free to add your support for any existing ideas that fit the additions you described. Thanks so much for stopping by. 

Stephanie | Community AdvocateAll that stepping got you exhausted? Improve Your Zzzs!
I get woken up on average about 20-25 times a night. I am a very light sleeper and it really takes a toll. I am constantly exhausted. I just started using my fitbit earlier this month. There have been several nights where I wake up almost 30 times and as many as 61 once! Its outrageous! But I know its true! I just wish that my puppy and boyfriend were more respectful of my sensitivity. I can't blame the dog though she doesn't understand!

Sometimes I remember many of them, but definitely not all.
My Fitbit starts tracking my sleep pattern when I sit down to watch tv at night as early as 7pm even though I don't actually go to bed until after 11pm.  Previously it worked just fine tracking my sleep the minute I hit the bed.  How do I fix it?
I heard magnesium was a sleep aid recently and I am curious, how much do you take?
I like sensitive , because my sleep is so erratic as i work overnight with a nonagenarian. So i regularly get 1/2 hour here, 10 minutes there, an hour here, etc. And i have found that if seems to be pretty accurate, because i always have to note the time when i get up and check on my charge. I also do not tap it for sleep cycle except on my days off, and just put in the times when i know i lay on the couch and then got up to get ready to go home. Very confusing i know but it validated what i believed was happening anyway.MaWitters
Hi @SleepBandit - I’m not sure others would want to post such personal information. But to track your own apnea, I suggest:Look at your SPo2 reading in the morning. It should be in the high 90s. Also check your oxygen variation chart in the sleep settings. It should stay within the two lines, meaning there are no major variations.As always, share your results and concerns with your doctor. My own doctor appreciates it when I share these Fitbit reports.
When I purchased fitbit one year ago, I was able to see my heart activity during sleep. Now and after months of unwaring fitbit, I was surprised that I need to subscribe with premium fitbit to see my data. Are you serious fitbit?I use your hardware, and the only reason for me is heart rate at night, then I have to pay?????What on earth! I will never ever recommend a friend buying your products

Sleep - on phone app, tap the Sleep tile.Manual - which Fitbit model do you have?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I second this! I've used this app for a while now and it is really good. The developer is active with it and a lot of research has gone into the fine tuning of it. It offers a lot of graphs and charts that draw a much better picture of your sleeping profile the longer you use the app.
Hello,I'm the owner of an older Fitbit and was thinking about upgrading.  I've noticed that some of the newer trackers do not offer the sleep tracking free (only with premium).Can someone let me know which still offer sleep without premium?  I'm willing to buy an older model.I wish the information was better outlined.Thanks so much
I too used to face the problem. What happens is that, when your HR is still approximately near your Resting HR, the device thinks you're still sleeping. Best way is to do a few jumping jacks (to quickly elevate your HR) to confirm that you have woken up.
Last night I wore two Alta HRs, one on my left wrist and one on my right.  If the FitBits were perfectly accurate you'd certainly expect them to have the same results.  After all, it's not really possible for my left wrist to be in Deep Sleep and my right wrist to be in REM, is it? Sadly, the results were pretty disappointing. According to my LW (left wrist) FitBit - I woke up 13 times.  According to my RW (right wrist) - I woke up 19 times.  That's dramatically different - a ~50% increase if you look at the RW data instead of the LW data.   The Sleep Stages data had some pretty key differences too.  LW logged an hour of deep sleep (16.3%) while my RW logged only 25 minutes (6.7%)  Light Sleep was different by nearly 60 minutes!  Looking at specific points in the night, I can find examples of one FitBit saying I'm in Deep Sleep while the other say Light or REM, and essentially every possible combination of sleep stage.  One says REM, the other says Light.  One says Light, the other says Deep.  Looking at the charts side-by-side I can say pretty confidently that it isn't purely random, and there are some similarities, but it feels a lot more like a sleep mood ring than advance sleep tracking technology. It's not all bad news - while the Sleep Stages seem pretty made up to me, and the number of times awake is wildly different, if you look at it from strictly an 'awake' vs. 'sleeping' they are very close to each other.  Time Asleep was 4 hours 58 minutes compared to 5 hours and 7 minutes.  +/- 10 minutes seems pretty alright to me.  I'm not sure that's any better than you'd get by just, ya know, writing down when you think you fell asleep and when you woke up, but I think it's a reasonable margin of error.  And the large blocks of awake time are virtually identical - IE - both have me awake until 2:17am and both show me awake again for 18 minutes at 3:24am.  There are just a few minutes where one says I was Light Sleeping and the other said I was awake. ConclusionTracking awake vs. asleep seems to work quite well for me, but everything else reported was unreliable.
Golden makes a good point.  I have use the data for similar purposes, such as seeing patterns between stress, certain activities, and the menstrual cycle and sleep disturbances.  For instance, looking at the big picture of sleep data, I saw that I was more restless on days I had to spend lots of time driving for work.  Armed with this info, I now take steps to relax, such as meditating and stretching before bed, to sleep better at those times.
While searching for something to cool down our bed, I'm wondering if anybody has experience using things like the BedJet, ChillPad, or something similar. Would be interested to see Fibit sleep data before and after implementation of the sleep temperature aids.

Hey,New to the community part of Fitbit, but used Fitbit for quite a while now... - I was recently (Mar 21) diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia during a sleep study.- I was prescribed Adderall for daytime sleepiness and concentration issues a couple weeks prior to the study.- Within the last two months, it has come to my attention that i have issues with mild hypothyroidism. My main question is:I am on 50mg Adderall for my tiredness and ADHD, and I literally cannot function without a 4:1 sleep-to-wake ratio or Adderall.  However, Adderall takes away all my appetite and my doctor specifically told me to stop vaping to induce appetite and suggested weaning off the adderall. For those of you who have hypersomnia, is there other meds or methods you have used to be able to function daily? Thanks,Amanda

Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Hi, there! New Fitbit (Flex) user here. I have trouble falling asleep due to anxiety and I toss and turn a lot, so I set my tracker to Sensitive. I've only used it for two nights, but so far, I feel that I am getting pretty accurate data. Last night, I woke up to go to the bathroom and so I turned off sleep mode before getting out of bed, then turned it back on. The tracker recorded two sleep events, which I find more accurate for me than if I'd let it record the bathroom trip as a regular awake-but-in-bed event. I'm a snooze-button pusher, so each morning, the tracker records multiple restless events as I'm rolling over to hit snooze, going back to sleep, then hitting snooze again. I think tomorow morning, I will exit sleep mode the first time my alarm goes off. I know the "cheat sleep" won't get counted, but neither will those restless periods. One question: on my log, I see red bars with spikes -- I'm assuming the shorter bars indicate "restless" and the spikes are "awake" -- is this correct?
It's really going to depend on your doctor.  Some of them are looking at the tracking info for medical issues, others say they are not medical devices, and won't look at the data. My doctor looked at my data and help me get on a drug to lower my heart rate.  I've gotten off that drug now.  Amazing what losing 65 lbs does to the body! Good luck!

@cindylike24The Sleep Cycle app won't work if it's on a shelf near you as it won't detect movement. All it would detect is the time tou turned it on/off to indicate length of sleep time.
Hi.  Does anyone know how to manually enter information on the FitBit Dashboard so that it shows how many steps you acheieved doing a particular activity?  For example,  if I lift weights for 15 minutes, that is an equivalant of aobut 1,000 steps. But it doesn't show the actual 1,000 steps for that activity in either MyFitnessPal nor can I find a way to add the actual steps on my FitBit Dashboard.  Anyone know how to do this?  Thank you. beckypharo@yahoo.com
@4myselfWhen you have set the sleep timer and after you turn it off Fitbit applies movement filters for the type of movement it has detected. It cannot detect pulse.

Hi Corry. Interesting that you mentioned melatonin as I've been looking into that. My knowledge and understanding of it was limited to the connection with our detection of circadian rhythms and falling asleep. I hadn't considered the aspect of it helping with deeper sleep and less likelyhood of waking during the night. I shall certainly give that more thought. I do tend to read before going to sleep and find I have no trouble dropping off. It's the patches of restlessness during that night which frustrate me.  I'm LDS (Mormon) so don't drink tea, and tend to have a glass of water by the bed. If I drink too much of that though I'd be getting up in the night for other reasons!

That does make sence.  Just making sure I fully understand.  I had him make his own account when I gave him the tracker.  But since the tracker was initally mine and now his.  He would need a brand new never used fitbit for it to not show up onto my account.
Would like to know what the difference is between the Normal setting and the Sensitive setting for sleep on the fit bit flex
Hi @StephenKim - Your statement -  When I do chest-exercise, I get this strange feeling of tension, the feeling that my body or my head has been alerted -  has me concerned. I believe this is worth mentioning to your doctor. Be safe.
I came to the forums tonight (having only had Fitbit Charge 2 for only a few days) concerned about the accuracy of the sleep tracking.  The first couple nights I thought it odd that my percentages of Light, Deep, REM, and Awake seemed to match the Benchmark percentages right off the bat. So I got online and found that you can change the setting from Normal  to Sensitive, so I did.  Now the periods that stages changed were more erratic, but STILL in the end, they ended up with the same "Benchmark" percentages.  This has got me very suspicious. Also, like you, it would start recording light sleep way before I actually fell into any kind of sleep.  In addition, I walk several times a week. Today I used Runkeeper and the Fitbit. Runkeeper which uses GPS said I walked a little over 3 miles and yet, the Fitbit said something like 2.17 miles. How can that be?  I also don't want STEPS walking around the house to be counted, so the only thing I can do that is to take the watch off. That's a pain. I'd like to be able to say when I want STEPS counted and when I don't.  It's also saying I'm burning tons of calories and I don't see how THAT's accurate either!!!  I'm going to give it a few more days, but I'm starting to wonder if this watch is worth the money.
How do we get  fit bit to address this issue?
I actually clicked on help then followed the link to the online chat support. Long story short they had me remove the device from the app on my phone then re-add it, also did a couple reboots of the fitbit.  Nothing happened at first. I did this a few times and after a couple of days it all came back and has been tracking sleep ever since.
Hi wondering how normal or abnormal this pattern is. This is pretty much a normal night for me. It seems I go for from deep sleep which only lasts a few minutes to instant awake every single time.
I thought the issue might have been my old inspire but now I have a new Luxe and it is still the same problem.
Thanks for the update @Suzzi1961 .  I agree the Flex requires getting some used to, especially when putting it into sleep mode.  There were times I would have to keep tapping for like 5 seconds to get it to vibrate and flash between 1&3 lights and 2&4 lights.  Some nights it seemed like I was just pounding by finger to my wrist to get it to activate.  Best of luck.
Yes Bluetooth is listening 24/7. However if you are referring to the EMF. Every device that has electricity flowing, with or without a radio, through it will give off EMF. This also goes for the wires in the wall.
Not sure why when I do exactly what everyone is saying by opening the app from the app store, that mine just opens as usual and doesn't show an update.  I still can't get that chart to show on my IPhone.  It sounds like maybe Fitbit is still working on this issue but if anyone has any further suggestions, I would appreciate them!  Thanks.
I have the same exact issue!
Paul,I would highly suggest a sleep study. I also found myself waking up at night and was always tired no matter how much sleep I got. I went to my doctor and she said nothing was wrong. I went back almost two years later and demanded a sleep study and found out I have Narcolepsy. Google it and see if some of symptoms match yours. A lot of doctors are not familiar with Narcolepsy so it's often overlooked. Seeing how you are in shape and always tired I would seriously look into this option and find a doctor who specializes in sleep disorders. Good luck,Carolyn (mcwild@earthlink.net)

Hey fitbit community, Just got my alta hr last night, so I can track my sleep since i have a long story with sleep disorders. Last night, my watch recordrd my movements during sleep as steps, so I looked out in the forum and changed the sensitivity, however I have some questions about this option. 1-Activating this option should be only at night or during all the day, so the step tracking can be accurate both at night and during the day? 2- Activating this option can impact the sleep tracking? if yes how? Feel free to share how the sensitivity works, cause I looked in some articles and I didnt quite get it, for better understanding how the watch works. Thank u in advance.Aminos.

I'm not really sure what you mean. All the data you could previously see is still there. See below, the first screenshot is using the standard HR chart which was available before premium (and still is)  Below is what is included with Premium (and was never available previously). As you can see the Premium version is more detailed, but the point is, the version that existed before premium still exists and is accessible by non premium users.

Mine is usually around 5%. I think it probably varies a lot between individuals. It may be more important to compare how your restlessness varies from one night to the next, rather than comparing your restlessness to someone else's. I don't think there one "right" value for everyone.

Last reliable sleep data was the of 9/1.   I have restarted multiple times, logged out and in multiple times.   This feature worked every day from the day it was deployed to the morning of 9/2 Please advise...
Can you please reexplain this more clearly?  I go to sleep Thursday night, I wake Friday morning when sun comes up. I want to check how I slept on my Thursday night sleep period. This is how humans refer to their just completed sleep period. So the Fitbit app should show Thursday night right?it used to be like this.
The software seems to have a glitch somewhere.  An example.  I spend 8 hr, 20 minutes in bed 12:30 to 8:50, so the "time asleep =  8 hr, 20 min. That's fine, but it is not the sleep pattern that was recorded. That pattern shows almost 30 minutes awake, over 90 minutes restless. So the 8 hr, 20 min is in error.  And that's just one instance out of many.  Are there simmilar glitches in other parts of the software? Why isn't the software properly calculating the data recieved?
My device 3.73 it's not logging my sleep I wear it to bed every night.
Not sure which Fitbit model you have, but performing a restart on it 3 times in a row may help.

Fitbit HR @JohnnyRow
while sleeping for probably half a hour or hour my blood oxygen vibration was at the lowest it could be and stayed a solid straight line before coming back up again what does this mean? Iv also had breathing issues lately so could that be why too?
Just a comment on the sleep score algorithm. I can assure the FitBit developers that even though I "slept" for 7 hours last night I do not feel remotely as alert this morning after being woken up every 3 hours by a newborn than I do when I get a straight 7 hours of sleep. While last night was not my worst night of sleep in my life it definitely didn't warrant an 84 sleep score.  I think the algorithm should more heavily weigh times awake during the night against your score.
I have a question which illustrates the underlying issue in my previous post about FitBit Sleep tracking measurement which I am trying to resolve, and I want to use a diagram to try to explain it:  Looking at the picture below, which shows two 6 inch rulers, what is the length of the blue rectangle?
This is what fitbit say: "There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your tracker from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your tracker higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your tracker to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your tracker’s battery is critically low."taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163/
Individual days sleep time is still available, but the weekly average is not

Time to fall asleep is nonsense as well.This pic from last night states zero minutes to fall asleep. Well I know for a fact I listened to a podcast for twenty minutes!
Looks like Sleep Number is a brand of "smart" beds (I’m not based in North America, so wasn’t familiar with them), and SleepIQ is their app. Did you check this help article from their site?

Hi, yes, myself and my husband have Charge 2 and every so often both have trouble with the Sleep data not showing correctly. Sometimes 2wks at a time and have this happening now for the past 10 days or so, very frustrating! Had mine over 2yrs now and husband has had his Fitbit 11/2 yrs. Also same problems every so often with the heart rate not beating and not showing details. Log out and then later log back in, sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t! 😕
I called the Fitbit customer support(1800 875 234)They suggested the whole 'turn on/ off' thing, followed by changing the setting from 'normal' to 'sensitive'.. and it has subsequently worked fine.My ability to sleep, not so much lol, but that's why I bought the thing.If all else fails, try the 180 number, it's an OS call centre, but it worked for me and they were pretty easy to deal with.
@G2EWS I also believe you have a really good suggestion, I'm glad you submitted it through our Ideas bord, why don't you share the link to your suggestion here so all of us can vote! 🙂

I was freaked out by the sleep efficiency stats.  I thought I slept well and 7.5 to 8 hrs per night.  I was getting stats of 46% to 73% for my first 5 days.  I realized that I had it set on sensitive.  I changed it last night to "Normal" and I got 96% efficiency.   I will leave it on that setting instead.
Thank you Anten33. It is comforting to know that other people are having the same problem and that it seems to be a Fitbit issue rather than anything we are doing.Sent from my iPhone
I have noticed lately that my Inspire has been missing parts or all of my sleep at night. The battery is fully or nearly fully charged during these periods. Any idea what might be going wrong?
High fiber diet is supposed to help with sleep.i started about a month ago, lots of fruits & vegies, also i have concentrated on reducing sodium intake.I am sleeping much better....so i think diet helps.
Thanx for your reply, Matilija! I swear posting the question and of my frustration made my fitbit correct its reporting of my sleep cycles. (That, plus my changing the settings to sensitive)..... All is well, with the issues you spoke of. Nice to hear of someone doing the same things I do.For exercise, I am SOOOOOO lucky our community has two pools and offers WONDERFUL Deep Water Aerobics classes. I go 4 days a week for an hour and it makes a huge difference in my attitude, posture and over all well being. Without hurting my legs and hip more than they are already!!! I strongly suggest it whenever I have an opportunity!Thanx again! and best always,Sara
Hi @DogwoodNC, and welcome.I think your question is going to be very, very difficult to answer. For one, almost all the HRV data I've seen is for age range 18 and up. Second, that there are chronic conditions involved make the question more complex. A doctor would likely be the best resource on taking the data and conditions into account.I did fine one study Umetani et. al, 1998 for normal ranges for ages 10-99, that you might want to show her doctor and see what they think.  Hope this helps.

I had the same problem with my Flex.  I'm hoping it isn't time to get a new Fitbit.  Sounds like its an app problem rather than my gadget.😁
Yoga can help 🙂 I highly recommend searching for Ekhart Yoga on YouTube. I also journal or get out my coloured pencils and colouring book (not kidding haha) before bed. Playing some relaxing music can be a good addition. These activities help quite your mind and focus on letting the creativity flow, getting thoughts out of your head and onto paper so your mind has some room to move and rest. Hope these ideas help.
I think the first questions you should ask yourself should inclue things like the following.  Is it telling me I have good sleep efficiency or not?  Is it telling me I am a really restless sleeper when I thought I was sleeping well through the night?  Does it take a long time to fall asleep or do I fall asleep within minutes of going to bed.  Are you satisfied with the numbers you see or are you saying to yourself, "holy cow, I thought I was sleeping through the night." If you don't like what you see, maybe this site can help Sleeping Tips & Tricks - National Sleep FoundationThere are also good tips from WebMD and the Mayo Clinic. I stopped tracking my sleep after several months because I was satisfied with my sleep and it wasn't giving me information that I didn't already know.

@RoseOI recommend checking the clock to see the time you get into bed and subtracting it from the time you woke up to get an estimate of the time asleep. Once you have that estimate, I suggest comparing it to the time your Flex gives you, they shouldn't be too far apart. As @Rich_Lauementioned, "normal" is the recommended sleep sensitivity setting.
 
@kate88booksHow do you like using the white noise app? Do you find that it helps to fall asleep? I wanna try one but I have issues falling asleep with noise and lights on during the night.

I actually had a fitbit dream last night lol, but it was more of a nightmare.  I was lifegaurding, and wearing my Blaze.  I had to jump in the water to save someone (No problem, I work in the 2 ft and under section, mainly kids), and when I got out of the water, my blaze screen had gotten a scratch.  I woke up crying.

Fun topic! Yes, I frequently remember my dreams. I also sometimes lucid dream where I can control what happens. I love those, because I always make myself fly in them. I have a sort of dreamscape that has been with me since I was a kid. It has changed and altered over time, but there are always some similarities and familiar landmarks, plus several recurring people and animals I know fairly well now. There are times that I dream these places and people so vividly that when I first wake up I have a hard time realizing they aren't real. I attribute that to sleep fog, because once I'm up and about, I don't have those doubts. I think my favorite two places in the 'scape are this sort of outdoor corridor mall where some old men like to play checkers and one-up each other with playful insults and jokes. The shops always have new and different things, and there's a vending machine there I really like. Then the other place is the pig farm. The farmer who works there has a border collie who always runs up to greet me, and the farmer has interesting gossip. Usually in these dreams, I'm driving a carriage. That didn't start until I actually did that as a job for a while. Before that, I was either riding a horse or driving an antique car. I love dreams! Your planet dream sounds so cool. It's so much fun when they're surreal like that.
Read it got it thanks!
Hi,Perhaps try to read a good book at the end of the day.Along with a glass or almond milk or tea. Add some honey if you like.This works for me. A few suggestions and hope they work.
I woke this morning..computer synced fitbit...I can't manually enter for last night sleep?
I used to wear mine on my non-dominant wrist always, and always got sleep efficiency ratings in the 50's or 60's. Never higher than 73.  I got a new purple Charge HR a few months ago and it gives me big red marks all of the time (the last one, a black Charge, didn't do that). I decided to switch it to the other wrist occasionally to help my skin. I was surprised to find that I get much higher efficiency ratings when I wear it on my dominant wrist.  This leads me to believe that I move one arm a lot more than the other.  I do know that I often wake up to find my left arm is up, for whatever reason (just from the elbow, not the whole arm).  Has anyone else noticed a difference in stats when you switch wrists?

@Mardi50   Fitbit's sleep tracking has a very good reputation.  Premium users get more detailed sleep analysis.  This detailed information can explain a lot, compared to non-Premium sleep stages and score.  There are three section in the breakdown, with a possible 100:Time Asleep:  This is 50% of the score - highest possible 50/50 points.  Your time asleep is your total time in bed, minus the time you're awake.Deep and REM sleep:  This is 25% of the score - possible 25/25.  This is what you see in your sleep stages graph, but this is only 25% of the score.  Sometimes I'll get a lower score than I expect, then I look at the graph and benchmark data and see that I had very little deep and REM sleep.  You get benchmark data that compares you to others in your age group.Restoration:  This is 25%of the score - possible 25/25.  It includes how restless you were and looks at your sleeping heart rate.  Your heart rate usually slows in your sleep.I found out things about myself by using this sleep data and making changes.  I feel like I'm the textbook example of a human circadian rhythm.  I really need to be in bed by a certain time or I get a crappy score.  I can eat chocolate in the daytime, but evening chocolate is bad for sleep for me.  Alcohol makes you feel sleepy, but it really messes with your deep and REM sleep.  Sometimes my score is lower than I expect to see because my heart rate didn't go as low as usual, most commonly because of food or certain wines too close to bedtime. I hope this gives you some insight.  I have Premium and my husband doesn't.  I keep trying to explain to him why he gets the scores that he gets.  Fitbit has a two week Guided Program called Habits for Restful Sleep.  Please take a look at it.  I personally don't recommend buying Premium just for this feature.

How do I add screenshot? Sorry
So sleep experts would confirm that “awake time” for fitbit counts towards the 7-8 hour goal? All these months since i had my Fitbit  my average hours asleep has been 6 hours and 20 minutes (not counting the awake time)? I wasn’t, no matter how hard I tried, able to average more than 6.5 hours for a week even during my weeklong vacation in December. whenever i finally get more than 7 hours (not counting awake time) in a night, then i am not tired on time the next night and can’t fall asleep end up sleeping only 4-5 hours the next night. I thought something was wrong with me. But maybe I could be meeting guidelines?

I think I have it logged so thanks for the help...
This has happened to mine too! It has left me quite confused as to what is the real time spent asleep, as it seems to have added almost an extra hour onto each night! Quite a big difference.
As a fitbit user, I would like to see a feature added that allows you to set an alarm based on your sleep target, that would only go off once your fitbit records that you have slept for a certain timeframe, say 30 minutes to three hours instead of setting an alarm and hoping for the best, when you arent necessarily sleeping for the right amount of time. So once you fulfill your predetermined nap or sleep time, the fitbit alarm will go off. This woud be especially useful if you are like me, and would like to follow a polyphasic sleep pattern/ use the uberman method, to increase daily productivity. It would also be useful for people who have problems with oversleeping and under-sleeping, and this would help with actually reaching your sleep goals.
@SunsetRunner Nice to see you around and thanks for sharing! 😅
 
Wow, I can't believe caffeine doesn't cause any side effects on you. 😊 I wish I could have the same results. 😊

Hi, same issue for me, except I spend 95-97% of the night above resting heart rate. I can’t find anything online either, just references to spikes. My heart rate goes up when I fall asleep and stays there until I wake up. ive tried altering things like bed time, no alcohol, I don’t drink caffeine after lunch time anyway, and even water fasting but nothing seems to make a difference. I’m wondering if it’s time to call my GP.
I have an Ionic and for some reason it won't record my sleeping habits. I've tried several things to fix it with no luck! This was a pretty important feature and one reason I decieded to purchase it.  Any suggestions I'd really appreciate.Thanks!
Two questions:(1) Am I doing something wrong with my Fitbit Charge 4 such that it is not tracking sleep?(2) If I am not doing something wrong, when are you going to fix that application so it works?  One of my main reasons for this purchase was for the sleep function.  I am very disappointed.  It didn't work properly in my prior Fitbit either.  I've seen a lot of traffic in this discussion.  What is your plan to fix the software or the sensors?  Thank you,Mary

I wake up because of an age-related neurological disorder.This has been the bane of my life for more than 10 years,but I think I've finally solved it.When I wake up, I reach for the night stand, open my bottle,and take a half-dropper of CBD under my tongue.I've only been doing this for a few days, but it's helped so far.
Thanks for you reply, that 3 hour is the best without interrupted, but when i wake up and pee, then it is hard to fall asleep back. The best approach might be full 7 hours during the night, but i just cannot do that, the result is, i might take a lot of nap during the day.
Hi @Rcastle Welcome to the forum. May I ask what type of Fitbit you have? I find sleep tracking to more accurate if you are using a tracking with HR monitor. A trick I have found too, if I don't think my sleep data is accurate, for example I got up during the night and it didn't register that I went back to sleep, I delete the data and manually log the start and end time and then the rest of the data will fill in, showing me a more accurate representation of my sleep. I hope that helps.

The sleep data is interesting, but now that I know I have periods that are not restful, what do I do about it?  Is there a resource for putting it to use?  Is there information that will help me make improvements to my sleep?  I'm wondering how to turn it from an interesting novelty to a useful and actionable tool.
Nice to see you around @SunsetRunner! Those tips are really good, specially the one that mentions to leave your pet out or your bed. I used to sleep with my dog and when she stopped sleeping with me, my sleep got way much better.

I have a bad habit of messing up my sleeping routine astronomically. 
For a few nights, I'll do the good 10 or 11 pm-6 or 7 am sleeping. Then it will get all messed up. It gets so bad to the point that I'll be waking up at 7 pm and going to sleep at 7 am. I am in college but we are currently on a break until my next course starts, and I do not have a job (plus I live remotely and far away from any of my friends). As a result of this, I don't have anything to keep me busy during the day and so my sleep schedule goes around the clock until it is very bad without me even noticing. 
 
When I am doing college or am spending a lot of time out of the house during the day regularly, I still do not go to sleep until about 2-3 am, resulting in me doing these activities on 3-5 hours of sleep most times and sometimes none as I don't trust myself to wake up and so stay awake the whole day, causing me to crash when I get home at only about 5 or 7 pm again. This just feeds the loop and increases the problem.
 
I am only 16 years old, so I know that my circadian rhythm is at a stage where going to sleep later is common, but that doesn't make it any less inconvenient. Also since I don't go outside often due to there not being much to do around here, the light/dark psychological factor doesn't help tell my brain that it's time for sleep since the majority of my time being spent looking at artificial light from my phone/television/computer screen.
 
Any tips on how to tame my sleep schedule would be greatly appreciated!

The first time I tried it it worked but not this morning 😞
Your FitBit isn't taking your pulse or heart rate. Here is an article to read about it.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
this is a nightly occurrence for me, my doc says it's 'anxiety' related.  anyway i can usually fall asleep ok after reading, but always then manage to wake myself up (my fitbit used to show me awake multiple times during the night but less lately).  i've been reading a book about Mindfulness (sounds very gobbly **ahem** i know) but it does seem to help.  Also i find deep breathing, and when breathing out i say 'hush' (in my head), and this seems to quiet the chatterbrain too.  I've almost forgotten what it's like to have a 7 hour sleep :((
I tried replying via email but don't know it that works.  I'll try again. Sleep was recording just fine since Apr. 23.  Then the past few days, I put it in sleep mode via tapping my band.  When I wake up it either didn't record and or today it was out of sleep mode when I woke up.  I'm not doing anything differnt and I don't thrash around in my sleep or anything.  In fact sometimes I wake up and it looks like no covers moved or anything.  Makes it easy to make the bed.  So I don't know what is happening but I don't want to keep logging it myself.

Oh right!  OK, thank you @WavyDavey!  I'll try going to bed later tonight and waking up earlier then... not sure my hubby will want me to come downstairs at 5am though 🤣

any one with bruxism?
Thanks for the tip. I'm actually pretty good with it picking up when I go to sleep (pre bedtime walkaround generally helps).
its 4/5/17, and my sleep chart changed back to the old form overnite too. After 9 days. I liked that format, Where did it go? Why did it change back? and how do I get it back?
Cheers Michael! Yeah.. I'm thrilled with how I have done so far. 8k before work might not happen again, but it was a brilliant feeling! 4 hour run/walk in the countryside, brilliant exploring different routes. A friend of mine has said that I should do a half marathon with her considering I did over 13 miles today, I guess I would do it once to tick it off the list but I'm not the type that will keep doing certain events. I love the thrill of obstacles and entertaining events. Yeah... When I was a teenager I never seemed to have any issues post skiing. Now I make sure I have deep heat in case and stretch. I have been a skier since 5 years old or something and have always loved ski holidays. I'd probably say it is my favourite sport to do.  How long should you let your body recover? How does the motivation come back? I always struggle after the holidays. Receiving this after Christmas was amazing. I'd have loved to taken it to France but my boyfriend wisely said I might lose it and I barely knew/had time to work out how to work it at that point so I agreed not to take it with me. If my breathing & arches strengthen up better I can see myself running more consistently. It would be good to enjoy swimming more too. Just anything that will make me fit... Whereas at the moment my appearance is deceiving & people assume I'm fit. I was amused by a remark by someone from fitbit community struggling to work out why my breathing was so bad when I'd done exercise before December. I'd like to say I have sports induced asthma but I'd probably be lying 😛 and to get fit is like a piece of string isn't it... I feel good though, almost reached my 30k today & 500 Miles in lifetime badge. So as long as I keep going and don't stop then the motivation issue will be fine 🙂  Yes. Motivation will hopefully stick. Otherwise I'll need a massive kick. I enjoy sharing my updates with you Michael 🙂 thank you for your support. Term is now over.. I'll set some time to let my body recover.

Exactly! I couldn't care less about the sleep score. I just want to see average amount of time I slept.
Hi, Hanna. The tracker will continue to track your activity even in sleep mode. you can make adjustments  to your log, if you like, by looking at the graph. It will show increased activity when you awoke and began to move about. hover over the graph and it shows the time of each active moment.
hi, ive been using the Alta HR for some time to track sleep and it was dead on spot on which made me absolutely love that device as my primary usage is sleep tracking. Yesterday i bought the Charge 3 and while being pretty impressed by it ( screen, etc ) - i then realize here this morning that my first sleep with it - wasnt recorded - that has never ever happened on my Alta HR. I kinda wish that the firmware/software handling the sleep part was the same on those 2 - isnt that the case ? or should i really go back using my Alta HR ?
So I have just got my new Alta HR and while I love it I can't get the sleep recordings to show REM etc. I am only getting the awake, asleep, restless.Does anyone know how to change this? I have the sleep set to sensitive and I make sure to let it know when I'm going to bed and when I'm awake.Do you have to have a set amount of time actually fully asleep for this function to work? I have Narcolepsy so my sleep pattern is very erratic and the first couple of nights have shown that I don't stay asleep for longer than 40 mins at a time, the records seem to be full of me being restless or awake.I really would like this function to work though.
I got an Ionic on Father's Day.  That night I went in for a sleep study.  That night, and every night since, it has tracked very little of my sleep.  Maybe an hour or hour and a half with no details.Today I got the results of the sleep study.   Severe sleep apnea.   Would having apnea cause enough movement to make the Ionic think I was still awake?    I go in Friday night for a test with a CPAP.  I am curious if that will changes how it tracks sleep.
I love oriental music, the flute in particular is very relaxing, but the thing that relaxes me the most and helps me fall asleep is definitely nature sounds. Just a cabin in the woods with some rain sounds is perfect for me! 😀

@Pensive I completely agree with @SunsetRunner! Those foam earplugs are the best. My favorite brand is Mack's - find them here! 
 
A couple other things I like to bring when attempting to sleep on a plane:
-Try to get your significant other in a seat next to you so you can sleep on his or her shoulder (haha- just kidding)
-A comfy sweatshirt with a hood that can be pulled down over your eyes to shut out brightness
-Relaxing herbal chamomile tea (when the steward comes around asking for your drink order, just order hot water)
-Don't wear jeans or constricting clothing. I always try to wear my comfiest pair of leggings - lululemon has the best ones that also are acceptable in public 
 
Hope this helps! This is a great discussion topic, @Pensive thanks for posting it here!

I have had Fitbits for awhile now, so I am no stranger to how they work and I have my setting on normal. My watch is operating the way it should. I am just not happy with the way the software calculates sleep. And I’m fed up with all the suggestions about how we need to get more sleep and the negative effects of not getting enough. Oh, yes I am! I’m getting good sleep that is considered good for me! I am the type of person who cooks dinner by five PM and calls it a day by six! So, I often fall sleep by 8pm. I will sleep around two hours then wake up and watch some TV until I go back to sleep for the whole night.  Well, Fitbit is NOT calculating the two or more hours with the same night, so it looks like I am not getting enough. God forbid we fall asleep before nine! And I don’t need to sleep more than five hours straight. My average sleep score is around 70 and when I wake up with that score I feel good and refreshed, but when it gives me a score of 80 or higher, I wake up feeling groggy and can’t function!  I’m done feeling pressured that my sleeping is not good enough and that I’m not sleeping correctly! I do not want anymore advice from fitbit and when my premium expires, I’m done.
I have found I sleep much better with a fan or space heater running. It's prompted me to try some white noise apps (think I've settled on one called Relax Melodies). Headphones are uncomfortable while I sleep though so I just got a speaker for my room and will be trying it tonight.
When in sleep mode, does the FitBit flex recognize the difference between when you are truly asleep rather than lying still and relaxed, but mentally awake?  Or would it log all time lying still in bed as part as sleep as long as you are not moving?

Hi @Lizster I think the easiest way to test is for you to sleep tonight without your Fitbit on to see if you wake up at 3. There could be some other environmental thing happening that you aren't aware and you are now more aware of your waking because of your Fitbit. Give it a try tonight and report back.

My sleep looks very similar. Meditation is aways a good idea, but in my experience, exersise is the problem. I know I don't get nearly enough physical activity, but my job as a software engineer requires daily learning. I think that's why I get less deep and more REM. Back when I was exercising, I think I remember Fitbit telling me my cycles were more balanced. I'm going to try and start exercising again when our elliptical gets here to see if that helps, but it's hard to find time with a needy baby around.

@Roselefit I'd recommend making sure that you are using the most current version of the Android App. Click here to be redirected to the Google Play Store. After you've updated, you should be able to find the sleep schedule using the instructions that @CallieM mentioned in her post.
 
@JohnnyRow I'd also recommend making sure that your Windows 10 app is the most up-to-date version. Click here to be redirected to the Windows App Store. Afterwards, you should be able to access your sleep schedule by:
1. Clicking the tile that says "How did you sleep?"
2. Tap the moon icon at the bottom.
3. Set or edit your targets. To remove a target, tap the three dots in the bottom.
4. Click save.

Mine also rises a similar amount when sick. It is quite interesting that it starts to rise before the onset of symptoms- then turn down precisely when I feel better.
i have insomnia and go one or two nights a week without sleeping at all. is there a way to enter that or do i just have to wait until i sleep the next night and it'll skip the night i missed? you can only log sleep by start and stop time, not how many hours you got, which is a little frustrating, there should be an option for both. help!
@macurth Many of us get the broken sleep records with the Charge HR, I get 3 to 4 a night and only 1-2 minutes gap. Buit "Essential Tremor" would cause your activity in the Charge HR sleep recxords because all Fitbits with sleep detection are a movement detector. With your tremor type presumably in the hands, would cause that. I have successfuly used the wrist type Fitbits on the ankle with better results but I was checking pulse on the extremities of the body, not sleep. @macurth wrote:I've only been using Fitbit for a short time, but this morning when I looked at my sleep record I can't figure out why it looks this way.I went to bed around 11pm.Woke up at 5:30am and had to come down stair for medicineWent right back to bed, then got up at 7:35am to go to the bathroomFinally got up after 11am, never touched my phone and say I was awake or going to sleep other than the first time I went to bed or got up the next day.The Fitbit broken this timing into 3 groups and on the 2nd and 3rd the pink is not solid but striped.Out of almost 1 week I have many nights where I have solid pink, but there was 1 night that all the pink was a striped pink.I have essential tremor and was wondering if this could possibly be the cause of the striped pink sectionsI was wondering if others have had this same type of sleep records or have any idea why it would appear this way

Hi @Squeak14 If the issue continues, a trick I have learned is to delete the sleep data, then add it back in manually (estimated start and stop time) and the rest of the data will fill in and you should be able to see when you got up during the night, but then also went back to sleep. I hope that helps.

I have a Fitbit Flex 2 - how do I get calls during sleep time? My screen says that all calls are silenced during my sleep times. I need to be able to hear my calls - Thanks!
Hey thanks for that I'm not very tech saavy.  I have a fit bit alta HR.
I've always been a terrible sleeper.  I've noticed that the sleep detector on my Charge 2 simultaneously puts me into a the largest portion of Deep Sleep while pumping in memories of some of my favorite TV shows.  Lying in bed and watching Amazon Prime is not the BEST thing to do before bedtime, but the FitBit has me out cold. Maybe while watching TV on my laptop puts me into a deep trance.  Wow, now that is high tech!   (Please note Sarcasm 😴 )

How do you create graphs via phone browser?
The 3 hours is to get sleep stages.One hour should be cutoff to get sleep recognized without stages.  It should have been recognized.  I have seen naps between 1 and 3 hours recognized but I guess sometimes it misses it, maybe if you were particularly restless and wrist moving.

Thanks for this. Worked exactly the same for me! Went to App Store, and only saw 'update' option AFTER I clicked through to application details. Installed the update, and now all my sleeping heart-rate graphs are back 🙂 !
My versa 2 does not track sleep for a few months not. Every now and then tracks one night and then goes on for a few weeks without any entry. Tried to turn off heart rate and sync it to the app and turn it on again. Tried to uninstall the app and reinstall. Tried to change the sleep sensitivity. Let the wrist band looser and sometimes tighter and nothing seems to change it. The heart rate track seems to be working fine since it tracks all my exercises without problem. What else can be done.
Happened overnight for me too. I have obstructive sleep apnoea and found the new graph really helpful. Now it's gone back I'm quite annoyed. There's no point in it for me now.

you guys (fit bit) really need some detailed instructions on these things. I still haven't figured out how to log my sleep correctly on this charge hr and a couple other issues. Are there any detailed instructions floating around the internet worls that we can find? If not, it's really almost a waste of money when I can't properly use all the functions. thanks.
Hello @jonathankahan, welcome to the community forums! 
 
It is possible that if you wear more than one Fitbit device when you go to bed, there might be slightly differences between the sleep data, but this could be caused due to the position the devices are worn. But overall, your sleep data should be tracked in the same way since all wrist-based Fitbit devices automatically detect your sleep. We recommend wearing the Fitbit device you have, in a snug wristband while sleeping; don’t wear your device in a clip or pendant accessory.
 
For more information, I recommend checking the following link: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps!

Thanks, glad my memory wasn't deceiving me!  Sadly my times awakened doesn't go down much when switching to normal, though my restless sleep dissapears in theory.
And I believe that my low HR at night is causing my RHR to be lower. It's 48 as you can see.... but I thoughts RHR is different than your sleeping HR... so is my RHR actually that low or is my fitbit not calculating it correctly because of my sleeping Hr???
Hi Which Fitbit Tracker do you have?
Seems fitbit not tracking afternoon sleep or Nap.Is there any setting need to ON.. i'm new user for FitBit.Kindly suggest because other watch/band do.

Good call @trishe, sleep apnea is no joke, I know, I suffered with it for years before I checked myself into a sleep clinic.  My CPAP machine gave me my life back.
I am an octogenarian.  I use my fitbit to keep track of my sleep and to have a speedy way to check my oxygen and heart rate. 
 
I also need one with a band that will convert to a simple magnetic band because with arthritis it's impossible to get the hooks through the notches of a traditional watch like device.
 
What is my best bet?  I don't care about steps or intervals or anything else:  just sleep and heart rate.

I’d like to share another pain relief idea. This is not for everyone.  My doctor authorized my medical marijuana license, since I have a clotting disorder on top of degenerative arthritis and cannot take anything for the pain. I’ve never smoked marijuana  or used it for a recreational high, But talking to various people/users/doctors ... I developed a plan that works to take the edge off my pain.My anesthesiologist told me that CBD is naturally anti inflammatory . She takes 10 mg every morning and suggested I do the same, taking an extra one at night if needed.  It helps. I also concocted my own “cocktail” of a CBD cream and 5 drops of a THC oil and rub that into my problem joints twice a day - morning and just before bedtime. Finally, if the pain is really bad at bedtime, I consume a small 5 mg piece of THC infused chocolate. It’s not enough to get me high but enough to relax me and let me sleep. My Fitbit sleep charts how my sleep is much more restful those first 4 hours until the THC wears off. Again, I would never suggest smoking it or getting high. I do NOT use THC recreationally. But this works for me. On a side note, I’ve also participated in a study (at the University of Michigan) on THC/CBD for pain relief, detailing my process.
Hi @claire1390 Welcome to the forums. I've seen that happen a time or two. Easy way to fix it after the fact is to delete the auto entry and manually add the start and stop times for your sleep and Fitbit will populate the data for the entire time. I'm not sure why this happens, but I hope this tip helps.

For the past 3 months I've only gotten sleep scores 1 week out of each month. Would just give me the basic information.. time awake, time asleep, time restless. The last 2 days, not even getting anything at all, the day doesn't even show up in sleep as if I haven't slept or didn't wear it, unless I do a manual add even though everything else syncs perfectly (Charge 2) Fitbit support was zero help in my problem before since mine is out of warranty, when the issue clearly isn't the device, and they refuse to acknowledge they have a problem to fix. I've tried everything. Have you tried the usual restart device? Thats usually the first and most helpful in some cases.
thank you so much

I am infuriated by this because I know for sure that I did it properly because I am doing it exactly the same way as I did 3 weeks ago and it ran perfectly then.I take the sleep pattern info here very seriously as well.  I can't wear a CPAP machine, and I have sleep apnea.  The fitbit readings definitely confirm that.  I will experiment with relaxation exercises before going to sleep, as well as monitoring night-time eating, which I suspect may be a big culprit in my lack of sleep.  The funny part is, later in the evening when I stretch out on the sofa to watch TV (legs up but still in a sitting position) the FitBit records it as sleep!  In fact, it sometimes record my daytime total lack of movement (at a desk) as sleep!!  At first I though their was a problem with their program, but I have a feeling it is accurately telling me that I allow myself to be too rested during the day.
hey there and congrats on your new buddy! Sleep recording is a function of your tracker and nothing special is required. The data comes up in your phone app when you look at the today screen. to get more information, you have to click into the tile. There it will show you your time asleep and the stages you cycled through. Here is a link to a help page that can answer your questions.

It is now available on my wife's Fitbit, but not mine. Support said it is a premium service and I need to buy a plan. However, my wife has not, and they confirmed that. I do not think support knows what is going on or is aware of the feature.
The same here. I had forced-quit Fitbit and reset the breathing rate on the dashboard last Friday.  It is working since then, 3 out of 3. But at this point maybe it works cause they fixed something in the background. The Spo2 rate also works without having the watch face, it just appears in the late morning. Updated 10th/Feb: Yesterday's morning showed no data but today's back on track.
You’re right, @SimonCat - it is an approximate tool, not a medical tool. But it’s a good tool. I saw my pulmonologist last week and showed it to him. He told me to keep an eye on the graph. If I start seeing bigger gaps or high gaps, to call for an appointment.  I sleep with a CPAP and apparently it is doing the job. My graphs have been low and consistent.
So sorry to hear about these long term covid issues, @Natastrophe. You can find “normal” sleeping heart rates if you google it. But I would strongly suggest you ask your doctor for their opinion.  Wishing you success on your road to recovery!
@AshMinx  @SunsetRunner  The information is still in the app.  I am an iOS user, so my icon to expand or contract a display is an icon of arrows pointing apart.   When I expand the Hours Slept, I can choose among 1 wk, 1 mo, 3 mo, and 1 yr. The app change that puts Sleep Score first has frustrated many users.  If you want to have Hours Slept displayed first, then I recommend you browse the Feature Suggestion forum for and existing request or start one yourselves.  Activity on the Feature Suggestion forum lets Fitbit know what is on user's minds.

My sleep stages stopped recording 2 days ago. It records all sleep but no longer shows staged
Nice to see that you're digging into the Fitbit Forums @Fred99, let me give you a warm welcome to our community.
 
It's very interesting you've noticed this in your sleep. Some doctors say that consuming alcohol prior to sleep is associated with a 10% increase in average sleeping heart rate. Take in count that alcohol may aid with sleep onset due to its sedative properties, allowing you to fall asleep more quickly. However, people who drink before bed often experience disruptions later in their sleep cycle as liver enzymes metabolize alcohol. This is no your case but for most people, their sleeping heart rate will fall to the lower end of the normal resting heart rate range of 60–100 bpm. In deep sleep, the heart rate may fall below 60 bpm , especially in people who have very low heart rates while awake.

I deleted the "sleep" card from my dashboard. Seems like since Alpha bought out the company, the sleep tracker is pretty worthless; and it wasn't all that useful before. I've never liked that it was a total black box and that you could have quite similar sleep "patterns" from day to day but get wildly different results. Frankly, I prefer to base my evaluation of "sleep score" based on how refreshed I feel when I rise.
This is happening to me too. (it is on sensitive, and shows stages, and a pretty good 'end of sleep' time.)
Yes, this happened to me last night. I forgot to wear my Fitbit to bed but in the morning I had data very similar to my usual pattern. At first I thought the data was just a duplicate of the night before but it was not exactly the same. I'm considering deleting it but then I noticed the going to bed and waking up time were exact. How did my Fitbit know this if I wasn't wearing it?
Hello @jrevans, @BBMCollins, welcome to the community forums! 
 
I'm very sorry for the experience. Please note that in order for you to receive a sleep score, you must receive sleep stages. There are some scenarios that prevent your Fitbit devices to register sleep stages. 
 
Please consider the following: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
Hope this helps!

In summary, although my amount of fitbit-sleep is highly variable from night to night, my 19 day moving average fitbit-sleep has improved about 2 hours over the year. The keys to that progress seem to be, in order of importance:1. sleep in a comfortable recliner rather than a bed,2. sleep in a lightweight, close-fitting, sleeping bag to constrain active arms and legs, and to get a swaddling effect,3. use foam earplugs or earbuds with comforting music to block alerting but harmless noises,4. use hood of sleeping bag to help block light and keep head warm,5. to compensate for highly inefficient sleep stay in bed a long time, using deep relaxation techniques to return to sleep even when early morning alertness appears,6. stop eating by 6p in evening,7. start thinking about and preparing for sleep before 9p.

I have been monitoring the Fitbit (night) vs Oximeter during the day.  Big disconnect, although night time is supposed to be lower than daytime.  I think the delta is too high at 2-3%.  Anyway there is a BIG spread in daily Fitbit O2 levels whereas the oximeter is much more steady and stable.  I personally think that the Fitbit is not all that accurate as I have had medical grade oximeter readings a few time this month and they are a much better match to the oximeter than the Fitbit.
I recall reading two threads on this. You can hand wash it in mild detergent and it will be fine. You should be able to dry it with a hair dryer and not lose time wearing it. It won't hurt the sleep band. Meanwhile, you could to rig something up while waiting for it to dry. I don't have a One, but it seems as though you could put it on your wrsit in a plastic bag and hold it there with a bandana or scarf tied around it.

Hi everyone Since the free premium membership came to an end I have noticed a change in my sleep patterns. It’s reporting a lot less time in deep sleep and not always showing times awake (when I know I have been awake). Now it could be that my sleep is a bit more out of whack than I realize but previously I have found that my experience of my sleep measured up to what my Sense was reporting. Could it be that without premium it’s not reporting as accurately or is it perhaps something else? Many thanks!
Hi, I don't know if this is too late to make a comment on this thread. However, I have just changed from Flex2 (after about 1 year having it on my wrist 24/7) to Charge 2 last Saturday to help tracking my heart beat during cardio and measuring quality of my sleep. I actually recently got some problems (minor: waking up at night, difficult to fall asleep but very seldom) with my sleep and I was very curious about the concept of deep sleep.From ever since I changed to Charge 2 my sleep was way worse than before. Even I tried to take nap in the daytime, it was also very struggling. It was just about 5 days I got Charge2 with me while sleeping. However, I can feel that it has impact on me somehow. Is there anyone got the same problem with Charge 2 or similar models which include heartbeat tracking functions? I think the green light of the Charge 2 is the problem.I will get rid of it when I sleep to see if any different or not.
From my phone, it says I can do it from my phone. It says I can press the home screen when I'm done and it'll still track my sleep
I got confused when my graph showed I was very active at a time I was supposed to be asleep.  (How can I attach the screenshot here?)  This made me think the sleep function's accuracy.
Good to hear ! I panic once myself for the samething.. I hate it when things don't work 😉
One thing that works for me is listening to podcasts at a fairly low volume. Something that does not have occasional loud (shouting, etc) volume changes. They have some meditative ones, or just some mellow talks. My iPad has a sleep function at a certain time or when the episode ends. If you have a significant other that doesn't want to hear it, figure how headphones work best for you. For me I lay on my side and prop headphones on so I can hear as I can't wear comfortably and go to sleep.It distracts my mind from thinking on its own. It's my routine now, never make it more than 20-30 minutes if not sooner.
I have the full face option (F20 resmed) and the machine is use is from Resmed.
If I'm understanding the question correctly - you're looking at http://www.fitbit.com/sleep and comparing the charts on the right.
 
There are four graphs - the top two of which display "Time asleep" and "Time awoken", while the bottom two display "Total time asleep" and "Total time awoken".
 
The top two are meant to display the information for the single largest sleep session of the day, which is going to be the night's sleep time for most users. The bottom two will display this same data, and will also include any additional sleep logs from that day (naps or short sleep sessions that supplemented your night's rest).
 
If you only log one sleep session each day, these graphs will always look the same. Hopefully that clears things up - let me know if I can answer anything else.
Fitbit trackers with heart rate monitoring keep taking readings throughout the night, if that is what you mean.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I have the surge. I am a healthy weight, 34 years old, moderate stress level, go to bed about 8:30 and wake around 4:30, exercise daily, heart and labs were monitored in December and were good. I do have orthostatic hypotension and have had it since I was a kid. Beyond that, no issues and I am a sound sleeper. I haven't had nightmares that I can remember. Is this a glitch in my watch? The morning heart rate spikes are accurate because that is when I exercise. I wear the watch fairly snug on my wrist. These two nights are the only nights I see that this has happened but from January 1 to now my resting heart rate went from 61 bpm to about 75 bpm.
The sleep tracking feature of my FitBit Charge is one of the reasons I finally decided to get one.But as I learn more about how it works (and how it doesn't) I'm not convinced this feature is useful. Or perhaps I just can't figure out how to use this data. First off, the FitBit does not actually measure sleep, it measures movement (or lack of).  I realize there is a relationship between sleep quality and movement, but by itself it does not tell the whole story. I've been looking for some guidance on how to intrepret this data.  I would love to find a study in which participants wore an accelerometer and some more reliable sleep study device to compare results, but I haven't found any such study. Second, I can't figure out if I should be using Normal or Sensitive mode for tracking sleep. When I first got it, I used normal and my sleep efficiency was measured in the high 90's. But I was still tired all the time, so I changed it to sensitive.  Now my efficiency is measuring in the low 70's (sometimes lower).  Here's the kicker: About the time that I changed it, something happened in my life that has most definitely effected my sleep.  So I can't tell if my low score is because of that life event, or because of sensitive setting, or both (probably both).  It's also possible that my exhaustion can be caused by something other than poor sleep quality, so my decision to change to Sensitive on that basis alone might have not been correct.  I can't find any guidance on how to choose between Normal or Sensitive.   And lastly, what do these results mean?  Sleep duration is controlled by two factors: the times I go to bed and wake up; and how restlessly I sleep.  The first are factors I can control.  But I'm more interested in my restlessness while I'm sleeping, which is probably best described with that sleep efficiency score. But what kind of sleep efficiency is normal? Right now, the only value I can see in this data is to watch trends as I change the habits that affect sleep. Something I could have done without the FitBit (by scoring how tired I am everyday). I've heard people say that it could clue you in to whether or not you need to see a doctor about sleep apnea. But I can't find any information on what to look for in your FitBit data that would support that conclusion.
Hi @allstealdeals  life gets to all of us at one time or another. For me, listening to old time radio shows have helped.  Many shows are available on the internet via a web browser. There are so many shows available at archive.org, which is where I found tons of The Lone Ranger shows from the 1940s and 1950s. If you ever heard of CBS Radio Mystery Theater, you can listen to their shows at cbsrmt.com. There are radio stations where people stream the old shows every hour of the day and night, so If you have Tune In radio app or any of them, check for programs you can listen to. Explore the old shows in a genre you like and you'll find yourself falling asleep and waking up in a better mood. If listening isn't something you enjoy, have you tried reading or even writing in a journal to make your evenings calmer?

Hello everyone! 😊
 
Getting a good night's 😴 💤 has been proven to have numerous benefits to your health and cognitive performance. 
 

Concentration: a good night's sleep improves attention and alertness. It has been shown that night-shift workers have poorer sleep, reduced performance and alertness, and higher accident rates compared with those who work during the day 
Memory: sleep affects our ability to recall and link information.

Avoid too much eating and or physical activity at least 3 hrs before sleep I find it helpful. I will have difficulties to sleep when I am exhausted (passed my tired point)
I just want to know if the time asleep includes or does not include the time awake? Today it said 9 hrs 23 min asleep, 1 hour 49 min awake. Do I subtract the 1 hour 49 min or is that already included??
Thanks so much for your response and for posting @FitbitSupport's response, Georgia!!
Thanks so much !!
I am the same way. I get very little deep sleep. Most nights average 30-45min which is much below the benchmark.However my rem sleep is really high. Sometimes higher than the benchmark. I feel ok waking up but worried about the lack of deep sleep.
Hi thanks for taking the time to answer, iv spoken to fitbit about this issue and they told me its a known problem and they are working on fixing it xx
Please i am new here can someone explain to me on how i can use my fit in tracking my sleep range!And i hope the family could help with that?

People who lose 5% of their body weight in six months sleep about 22 minutes longer than before.Recently, researchers have found that losing weight improves the symptoms of good sleep.Losing weight makes breathing easier in sleep and less soft tissues block the way to breathe. Better sleep can help burn fat.Weight loss means there is less physical restriction to breathe and less soft tissue to block the upper respiratory tract.Sleeping more helps burn fat more efficiently in the body, and so having a good night’s sleep means you’re more likely to maintain a reduced weight.
lorleo... if you have similar marking on your charts and you sleep with your mouth open, those are signs of possible sleep apnea. If your chart usually goes into the high variation two or more times a night, even by a small amount, it could be a sign of sleep apnea. Even a jagged chart that stays in the low variation area could be a sign. The sample rate on Fitbit watches are low. If you're afraid to ask your doc for a test, buy a ring O2 monitor (e.g. Wellue) and see the actual oxygen levels while you sleep.
@G2EWS That is really interesting. I know about REM and sleep cycles, except I was convinced every person had different cycle length. if as you say REM is attainable in 90 min it should be less hard to integrate into sleep log. 
I would recommend doing as @SunsetRunner is suggesting and post in Feature Requests if you have not done it already.
 
Happy sleeping!
downloaded Cardiogram which you can use with Fitbit. it showed my Hr got up to 175/182 in my sleep wtf??? Why didn’t fit bit show this? Should I be rushing to the doctor 😩
Seems to be normal. I have the same thing and others i know as well.I have almost between 40 to over an hr of awake time.Apparently what it means is that you were not really sleeping in that time but you won't remember it.
Hi, Is there any possibility to get the timestamp details also for the sleep data exported. @what time went to bed? awaken time,restless time which are shown in mobile app need to be included in data exported..Any possibility?Regards,Pradeep

Hello all!
 
@Glenda, what a coincidence, I have my own recordings as well. I have a river, rain and the sea. The rain is the one I use the most out of these. However, I find "white noise" even better. The sound of a blow dryer or a fan helps me sleep way faster, even during the day. That would be my recommendation "white noise".

No. Sorry I should have given more details.  My Charge is connected through the Bluetooth on my iPhone and I use alarms on my iPhone to get up in the morning but when I track my sleep with the charge the alarms on my iPhone are silenced. Sent from Outlook Mobile
Do you snore, have sleep apnea?

Hi @DavideFitbit - I agree that a bedtime routine helps. When I get settled in for sleep, I normally activate the Relax app on my Fitbit device. That deep breathing really helps me. If I’m still awake after that, I use a meditation technique where you start with your head/neck ... relaxing one muscle at a time ... all the way down to your toes. My instructor told me - “Don’t try to stop any thoughts. Let them pass thru without responding to them.”
I am worried about my sleeping heart rate being 100% above my RHR for the last several nights. Can anyone give me a clue as to why?

Thank you Emili.  I think I need to do some more research - your article was helpful.
It would be awesome to wake up after once our sleep goal is completed ...so that we make sure we sleep the required amount daily
Looking at posts, most people are complaining that the sleep tracking is too sensitive and says they are awake/restless during their sleep. I seem to see the opposite. I like to lie in for several hours and the Fitbit (Charge HR) thought I was still asleep, even though I was gaming on a tablet for several hours. One time I was lying on the couch watching TV and it thought I was asleep.All this is well and good, I can get pretty sedentary at times. But I think the ability to edit an automatically created sleep pattern to cut out erraneous info would be handy. The couch one, I could just delete. The lying in bed, well that isn't so simple. Any suggestions, or should I just relay this to tech support/app dev team?

Thank you, and yes, it is up to date. I finally got sleep stages for the first time on Wednesday night, and they went away last night. So disappointing - ready for Fitbit to fix whatever glitch this is! My friends who have the Charge 2 haven't had any issues, but I certainly have!
Well, I have been fairly impressed with the new sleep settings and felt until last night that it was accurate but now I am not sure. Yesterday, I logged hours of deep sleep while I watched a movie, put my son to bed, walked to the basement, came back upstairs, read in bed then Brushed my teeth. I then got up again, went to the basement and came back upstairs all while logging deep sleep. I tried to edit my sleep log to when I really went to bed was not able to and just had to delete the whole night. I understand the sleep tracking is based on movement but obviously I was moving a lot, even changing altitude through going up and down steps. I will try the sensitive setting tonight as an experiment but overall this is a disappointment.

As we/I keep our/my hands closer to head during the sleeping hour, does that impact me in any way as the fitbit device bluetooth is always on ?
Totally agree that a smart alarm is needed. I use the "Sleep Better" app just for this feature, but it means keeping my smartphone by my pillow.
I slept 7 hours but it says I woke up 21 times.  Can that be accurate
That's nice advice. Trust. That's what would give you peace.
Twice in the past week, I have full sleep data, but then after I take off the tracker for a stretch in the morning, then put it back on, it assumes I was sleeping all those extra hours, adds them to my total, and deletes all the sleep stages information. Editing the sleep entry back to the original night's sleep doesn't fix the problem, the sleep stages info is all gone.This has happened twice in the past week (and I seem to recall it happening once before that).Is it possible to stop this from happening? Why does Fitbit assume I was sleeping when I wasn't wearing the device?
My Sense records naps as little as 23 minutes many 40+ minutes naps If nap is over 60 minutes can/has effect night sleep
that is so funny poor you though. I have worked mine out now , I just hadn'tgot it organised properly on the pc so now it is fine.!thanks though x---This email is free from viruses and malware because avast! Antivirus protection is active.http://www.avast.com
I have given up on the accuracy of the sleep score, I ignore it. Indeed, I have asked time and again for proof, in the form of a published and juried paper correlating the Fitbit classification of the sleep stages through the heartrates with the brain wave studies which we assume to be the reference. No response. And the moderator's attempt to obfuscate the issues that is plaguing this function is frustrating. They know they have an issue with the population that gets up in the middle of the night and who are not getting accurate readings and all we get is: you should sleep better, like normal people. How condescending.I also just got a firmware update from Firbit, so I know they do updates on the devices, why not correct the problem through the firmware? Ob viously they don't care about the minority of the users who have this problem.
@canadiansamurai i had the same problem on my Blaze last night. Maybe the Blaze sleep insight went into deep sleep itself?  I can only assume, for now unless someone has a more justified reason, that my low battery level must have affected it. Was your battery level low at the time?
Hello Community members, For my senior year research project, I am conducting a study on sleep quality.  Mine is a family of fitbit users, but I do need a large number of participants. So, I am reaching out to the Fitbit community to kindly participate in my study.A participant in my study would need to fill up a questionnaire which may take 5 -10 minutes and provide their anonymized data for a corresponding period which can be downloaded from the fitbit dashboard. Interested community members may please respond to swati2mpwr@gmail.com.  I will provide further details and information on accessing the data through email.  Once I complete my project, I will be happy to submit my research findings to the community. I shall greatly appreciate your participation.
One new component of sleep score I’m just starting to discover is sleep restoration (which accounts for 25% of the total score). I didn’t realize how much my HR can fluctuate from one night to another, in relation to resting HR. Here are two examples from last week. Here is the Friday night (time asleep 7h35m, score 77):  I spent more than half of the time above resting HR. Here is Sunday night (time asleep 7h6m, score 83):  I spent almost the entire night below my resting HR, hence the much higher restoration score (23/25 vs. 17/25). Overall, I ended with a significantly higher score (83 vs. 77), in spite of slightly less time asleep. Although HR at night can be found within the 24-hour HR graph, there’s not nearly the same level of granulation. Here is what the HR graph looks like for the "poorer" night:  No way to see HR during the early hours of the day was elevated. And for people who go to bed early, their sleep is spread over two different days, which makes it harder to see their HR during the night. All in all, I find sleep restoration a great addition to the existing metrics provided by Fitbit.

Hi my sleep pattern is more like yours all these others look really disturbing...I thought mine was bad until I saw everyone elses...which still isnt good...I still wake up feeling not well rested and I am always exhausted not really sure what my problem is....plus i saw on a blog that you are suppose to drink half your weight in ounces of water daily...omg i cant even drink half of that....any suggestion from anyone???  I have blood pressure problems so I really need to figure something out thanks
See Why don't I see sleep stages today? That happens occasionally to many people due to any of the reasons in obove-linked article.  It doesn't mean that anything has permanently changed.  Check above article, particular for anything preventing good heart rate reading through the night.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
This has been a useful thread - i've had my tracking on for about 10 days and rarely sleep for longer than an hour at a time before becoming restless (maybe twice in total in 10 days). I had a feeling I've had a sleep disorder for sometime before getting the fitbit, I think this confirms it. Like someone else said I'm typically tired. Although I've had my device on sensitive, on my non-dom side as settings say. I'm going to have to see what it says on normal, but I'm not expecting (and kind of hoping) not to see a dramatic difference.
This was suggested in 2013 ... never mind, obviously Fitbit doesn't care about getting this feature implemented.
I find that the solid melatonin pills that are fast acting really help me. They knock me out right away and I have no trouble staying asleep. If you are still feeling groggy the next day try lowering the dosage and see if that helps.
I have the same problem - though I knew I slept badly. I have sleep apnea - supposed to wear a CPAC but end up taking it off and throwing it on the floor and turning the machine off in the little sleep I do get.  I have been averaging about 3 to 4 hours sleep a night.  Just got my second night sleep with 5 hours---am thrilled beyond words.   Would just love to get more.  I work part-time and am 72 years old and not in the best of health so a little more sleep would be wonderful.  But keep as active as you can.  That's what I do.  Keep moving as much as possible  I have had 8 surgeries on my back supposed to be in a wheelchair according to Drs. 40 years ago--didn't happen yet.  4th great-grandchild on it's way and Nana still plugging away!!!!!!
How are you going to access people's data? Wouldn't you need their passwords?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
@BrianHagmeier:  I would guess that you're not a leftie and I think your reasoning in any case is flawed. There is no right or wrong way to wear a watch or a fitbit.  For lefties and ambi's, it's a matter of trial and error to find out which wrist will work best.  It took me several tries, but I discovered that, for me, the right wrist worked best; all I had to do was programme my fitbit to meet my needs.  However, I was never able to wear a watch on my right wrist --- they would run in reverse. Even for some dominantly righties, using the left wrist might work in terms of sensitivity for their fitbit.  As for my refrigerator, it has two doors and they open either with my right or left hand; no adjustments were necessary.  My QWERTY keyboard works with either hand as well --- I use both hands on the keyboard and have no issues with where the punctuation and other keys are place; it's a matter of adapting just as with the fitbit choice of which wrist works best.
I am very excited to finally have my own Fitbit Ionic. I have been running it for a full month. The biggest insight I have gotten is that I simply am not getting quality, consistent, or long enough (in one block) sleep. I'm not sure where to go from here but I would like help with my sleep. I think it might help my other health issues related to autoimmune & constantly feeling like absolute crap.Can we discuss what steps to take to get the most  from what we are discovering from the data?
I'm looking at getting either a Charge 3 or a Versa 2, with my primary focus being on sleep tracking, though I'm not sure how interested I am in the alarm features. Do they track sleep automatically? Is the smart alarm feature the only real difference? Will I get the same data with either watch? I previously had a Zip, a One (fell somewhere between couch cushions and could never be found again), and a Garmin Vivosmart HR (fell off my wrist when the band broke, also never to be found again).
I'm using the new pulse oximeter and would love to know how to deactivate it. Its a waste of battery. The only thing it consistently provides is a population of fitbit users who now feel empowered to play Dr. WebMd on the forums and make telemed evaluations like "ya might have the sleep apnea" in the response sections. Curious what the average MCAT score is for the new graduates of FitBit University of Medicine, its gotta be on the same level as a Caribbean pay-for-admissions D.O factory.
I also got a fitbit, inspire 2 for Christmas and the sleep tracker only worked for one night. Are you required to purchase premium to get the sleep tracking?

@eezeepee  - a sleep score will undoubtedly be calculated based on your sleep goal, so is dependent on how this is set, which will vary by individual as each person has different needs, which may also vary depending on the day's activities and their stress levels.

I would like to see my sleep tracker to be more informitory maybe set up more like how it looks when i veiw a gps jog i just did, it should show the whole sleep broken down on a graph id also like to see my heart rate over the course of sleep to see if the elivations corispond with anything over the night maybe this could tell me more
I will try to send it again as it didn't go through
I have a Charge 2 and I still don't have it.
My sleep tracker used to seemingly be pretty accurate.  Starting in mid-July, it started displaying that I mostly got anywhere from1 to 4 hours of sleep, except for a few times here and there when it was more like 6-8 hours.  Sometimes it doesn't register any sleep at all.  Coincidentally, mid-July is also when I found out I was pregnant.  Has anyone else experienced something like this?  I don't know if that is the reason it stopped working, but it seemed like quite a coincidence.  I do feel like my sleep has gotten worse since being pregnant, but I can't imagine I am only getting a few hours of sleep every night and am still able to function.  But if it really is accurate, I'd like to know that too, because getting too little sleep can be especially bad while pregnant!
Here's yesterday. A quite weird week where I seem be not moving around much, tired when I wake up none the less. (normal mode)A normal monday. 10-15 awakes is normal for me.Bought my fitbit mainly to track how much I slept. I had the problem that slept too much, like 9-10h each night. Most days I felt tired and dazy. Bought a book about sleep and in the middle of it on 1-2 pages there was an example of a guy who slept to much... Doesnt seem to be a very common problem. Anyway, with some sleep restriction to about 7h per night, it really made a difference for the better.
I think that it stresses me out more when I see how little sleep I get,  and that effects how I sleep the next day or night.  I do shift work, but pretty much stay on a awake at night and sleep during the day schedule most of the time.  I also didn't sleep any better when I was on day shift because I had a hard time going to bed before 11pm and had to wake up at 430 am.. Last year I had a sleep study which was normal, slept better than I had in months ironically.
Either or both.  Try switch arms (and correcting the web-settings) when you sleep.  In another post, someone mentioned they use a trail camera to validate their Fitbit findings.  If your sleep habits and modesty allow that, a camera might confirm restlessness, snoring, or other movement interaction.  I've found I can't sleep when my spouse puts an arm over my rib-cage.  It affects my breathing.
There is a difference between insomnia and apnea.  First sympton of being tired during day is apnea, and you do not get a deep sleep if you have apnea, so you are showing waking 20+ times during night  Almost all health insurance plans cover a sleep study for apnea. Insomnia is when you have trouble falling asleep every time you wake, and you are not tired during the day from it.  Not uncommon to take 1 to 1.5 hours to fall asleep, you just do not need the usual sleep requirements.
Hello Joro- yes, I too have had some probs keeping my fitbit on my wrist. In fact after it came off for the 3rd time- I acutally lost it. But I got in touch with fitbit and they sent me a replacement one. I do like this machine but I think they have some engineering probs with their wrist straps.  Mike BriggsWashougal, WA

I usually listen to podcasts, mostly science or history ones and I leave them playing all night. That way when I wake up I can listen until I fall back to sleep. As a result I will generally listen to the same ones over and over because of course I usually miss the endings :). I haven't found that using devices before bed actually impacts on my sleep to a noticable degree, so I still play cards on my ipad or read a book on there as I am settling into bed.
I've been to sleep clinic twice (first for diagnosis and then to calibrate machine).  I gave copies of my sleep data to the sleep specialist and he kept them in my file.  The sleep data from my FitBit Flex corroborate his results and show a pattern that his results did not/were not able to show.  I would hope that all sleep specialists/doctors take the data seriously.  You can always give them the data and let them decide whether to keep it or not --- hopefully they will keep it in your file.  Best of luck.

I have the same problem. I'm not a real good sleeper -- never have been -- and I know the 90-plus efficiencies with the normal setting can't be right. But neither are the 40-50 efficiencies when my Flex is set to sensitive. This could be very interesting data. I have tried tapping into and out of sleep mode, as well as setting it from the software, as well as simply recording it manually the next day. Tapping seems to be the least accurate and manually recording seems to be the most accurate, as long as I remember what time it was I went to bed and got up. I want to keep up with everyone's experiences with this and maybe we can find the right setting protocol or provide Fitbit with enough information to make it more accurate.
@Paradise555 wrote:I tink you might have sleep apnea. I had the same problem before I got dianosed with it. It is worth a shot but do you ever stop breathing while you sleep? Or have someone told you that? Or snore pretty bad?Tiredness in spite of falling asleep easily and sleeping long (when OP was heavier) vs. no tiredness in spite of not falling asleep easily (now he’s lost quite some weight) would rather suggest sleep apnea would be less of a problem. Still, it’s worth checking, as sleep apnea is common when overweight. I noticed a clear improvement in my sleep quality after losing about 10 kg down to my current weight: no more sore throat in the morning (from snoring), no more tiredness in the late afternoon (from poor sleep quality). It’s often recommended to start slowing down a couple of hours before bedtime. That includes avoiding "blue light" (computers, tablets, smartphones, TV) during late evening. Melatonin supplementation could help too.

Agree, Charge sleep calculations should be more transparent. I have had a flex and a charge, both had reported similar sleep patterns so I'm not sure it's more than the accelerometer at work.
Hi @ruthkam, Fitbit uses heart rate and heart rate variability in determining sleep stages. If there's no a consistent signal, it may fall back to the simplified sleep. Hope that helps.

Hmm, same issue here. I only noticed the spike a few days ago, and wondered if there’s a bug in Fitbit’s display of time/timezones…There’s one spike almost every night at the beginning around deep or light sleep, according to Fitbit app, before heart rate mellows out until I wake up. Would be great to know if anyone gets more information from their PCP.
The device uses motion and heartrate to infer sleep. If you are still and your HR goes down, it might gauge that you are asleep. Some models have sensitivity settings you can modify. Since it’s getting tricked when you’re just resting, your sleep metrics might be more accurate if you lower the sensitivity. Hope that helps.
Hi, @Provis. I hope you're doing well!
 
Based on what you're looking for, I believe that the best option could be the Charge 5 (you can click here to find out more about it). With this device you can track sleep, heart rate and your blood oxygen level. Even though Charge 5's band is a watch-type wristband, you can buy a Hook & Loop band:
 

This band is easier to hook on your wrist since at this moment we don't have a magnetic-type band. This band can also be bought on our web store.
 
Hope this information helps on your decision.

You ever recover lost sleep REM OR OTHERWISE. Why rely so heavily on a wrist watch...even though I have one. And got it to monitor my awake vs calm periods, Fit bit is not giving you a sleep study it is more of a movement study . If is on your arm!,, The way to find out your Rem sleep is not possible from a Fitbit peridotA Fitb . EEGS MONITOR SLEEP and the leads are are on your head and your respirations are monitored by. person. They monitor your bite to see if a protrusion cause apnea If any one has a Fitbit that does that accurately well they may have to make a band big enough for your head. What I am saying is some people wake up in the night because of sleep apnea .where you stop breathing and the kick start yourself back, restless legs, to much sleep in the day...exercise in the night.n They do nap studies in some places..to see if that is the cause..or narcoleptic...but I think u would know that. Plain and simple a Fitbit is around the wrong area to monitor waves. It is in a place to monitor movement.period. A study is not a million bucks ...tell your docs your concern if you feel off . If it is just for your own info, do it if you want to know.
Same here!  Seemed to work fine Sun, Mon, & Tue (Apr 2-4), but went back to "No Stages" last night.  What gives?
Is anyone having this issue? When I do not set my sleep mode on my surge manually the sleep hours aren't accurate. When I try to manually edit my log the hours slept are not accurate.
After a long useless chat with Fitbit support and then a phone call with Fitbit support, I confirmed and learned two things that may help you. 1) What I first did, plug the tracker into the charger, hold the side button until logo and vibration occur, was the right first step.  It’s the equivalent of restarting a phone or computer.  And it may have to be done several times before it works.  However, I knew this and had done it over and over and this didn’t work for me. 2) Simplified sleep is based on movement while sleep stages is based on heart beat.  And in fact, my Fitbit is no longer showing my heartbeat.  The green light on the underside is flashing but on the face of the Fitbit nor in the phone app is the BPM working.  Therefore, the Fitbit rep concluded the issue was not the app update.  It’s that my Fitbit has gone bad for heartbeat and therefore it cannot do sleep stages.   It seems like a HUGE coincidence that the heartbeat stopped tracking at the same time as the update but I do understand that without the tracker monitoring heartbeat it cannot do sleep stages.
The sleep tracker is one of my fav parts about the Fitbit. It is bang on with me and when I look at the patterns, I know exactly if I was up or if one of the dogs was bothering me at that time. I am restless quite a bit but I still usually have over a 90% sleep rate.

Here is the link to the Sleep FAQ.  I have also changed all of the settings in the week reported to sensitive so that you can see the difference. I feel the $50 may give you the Journalling you require from the reports but you need to analyse the Sleep FAQ's to unravel Fitbit's definitions.  I used a Charge HR for these tests.and I have added a sleep cycle HR graph as well because I have a very slow HR and it can get down to 42bpm while asleep.

I recommend trying acupuncture and jade rolling to loosen the muscles. Meditation helps too! Try the relaxed breathing app with Fitbit.
In order to see the sleep analysis at the App, the data must be transferred from Inspire 3 to the Fibit cloud server and then received back to the App. Sometimes it is a long way to do for some reasons. Perhaps you do see incompletely processed data that was synchronized some time before waking up. Try to turn off the Internet on your mobile while sleeping and turn it on after waking up, so that all sleep data is transferred at once, and not partially.
Next time make sure to be annoying to the rest by waving your arms around  . Luckily it is easy to delete those false logs.

Odd, the only thing I can think of is time zone settings either on your phone or PC, depending on what you sync with. Probably PC given phones are pretty much automatic with locations now.  Another thing that will cause it to vibrate with no display is meeting a goal, check your goals and see where they are set, example is 10000 for steps, when you hit that number your fitbit will vibrate with no display.  Wonder if you have something set to low.  That's about all I can think of to check.
Seems pretty normal to me: http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-considered-a-normal-sleeping-heart-rate.htm It's supposed to be 8-10% lower than your normal (awake) heart rate due to the slower metabolism rate, so anywhere around the 60s sounds okay.
I slept from 8pm to 5am, 9 hours. My fitbit sleep says I slept from 8pm to 5am and says it was 8 hours. My sleep wasnt broken at all that night. What is going on here?

What is a good sleep efficiency percentage?

Can anybody share some insight into narcolepsy type 1?I'm epileptic and just recently my consultant wants me to go for sleep test to register my sleeping patterns as he's concerned there's more to my generalised epilepsy.If I share my sleep.log from fitbit can anyone tell me what their opinions are? Thanks
I, too, was frustrated with getting it into and out of sleep mode.  Sometimes it didn't matter how much I pounded on it, it wouldn't change modes.  Recently, I was reading one of the Flex101 articles about the different ways to communicate with the Flex; problems solved.  Tap [vs. "pound"] twice to wake it up.  Immediately after the lights stop moving, tap it again several times until the mode changes; usually about the 5th tap is where it will switch into or out of sleep mode, but don't stop until you see the lights change. Also, as FYI, when you go to sync the fitbit, tap twice to wake it up [see lights], then click sync on the PC or phone.
My husband and I have had the same problems over the last two nights. He has the Sense and I have the Versa 2. Our sleep was not recorded the first night and only partially last night. The other functions seem to still be working. I don't understand two different devices at the same time.
My average time asleep is 6.5 hours, and my average sleep score is 70.  If everything stays the same but I add an hour-long nap during each day, will my sleep score actually be better than 70?  I ask this knowing that naps are not always recorded or added in and rarely (if ever) change a sleep score on the screen.  But my question is this: can I be confident that a nap never hurts, never would lower the sleep score if it was or could be integrated into the original night-time score?
Have you thought of changing between and sensitve and normal?  There is a place on the dashboard in the settings under devices that will allow you to change from one to the other.  Might feel more accurate to you.  It really only does things based on movement so if you lay down and done move it thinks you are asleep.
Hello @Heather-M. It's very nice to see you around. 
 
I'm sorry to hear about your experience and thank you so much for taking the time to write it down here. I think I'll share a new topic about this in the next days, but for now, I think it is great to get comfortable and relax.
 
Also, try progressive muscle relaxation, work your way through the different muscle groups in your body (e.g. arms, legs, torso, face) tensing the muscles in each group at about three-quarters strength for approximately five seconds before releasing the tension all at once. Skip any muscles that hurt and try to isolate the muscles as you contract them instead of, for example, tensing your chest muscles when you’re focusing on your arms. Take slow, deep breaths in between muscle groups.
 
I think these tips can work for you, @Heather-M 😊
 
See you around.

i think you can find articles about how sleep affects weight loss if you search for it however you need to keep in mind that weight loss is like 90% of what you eat and 10% exercise
Make everyday exciting. The more the brain is challenged, the better chance of a good sleep.Try different bedroom/bed if that is an option.Eat balanced / health food.Have a good routine.The list goes on, and your Fitbit put your effort in numbers...
Awesome idea @G2EWS  Feel free to add your suggestion to the subforum URL: Feature Requests where users can vote, add comments with the possibility of being picked up by the developers to integrate the functionality.
you are right and I didn't mean to be rude, you were making a point, I know exactly what you mean. The problem is not in the device, it's in the software. The device was already changed back in March an the issue was not fixed, therefore is not linked to the device. For nearly 6 weeks I had readings  only on Tuesdays and only if the app was left open during the night. Then two weeks ago it stopped, which means they must have tried to fix it and they didn't get it right. You would expect to contact me to discuss how odd that was, because I let them know. Nobody contacted me, they have a new device to launch and they are too busy with that. M not blaming the customer service, but if you look around you will see lots of comments on the poor R&D of such devices
I called customer service just to log a complaint about the sleep score.  The guy did not seem to know what I was talking about at first.  I was put on a short hold.  When he came back it seemed as if he had a script about the sleep score.  I also went on Google Play and gave 1 star and wrote my issue.  Hopefully the powers that be will start to notice that the majority of us don't like the sleep score or find it useful.
When I saw the notification in my inbox regarding a reply to this post, I thought it was Fitbit contacting me.I guess that's an LOL.Disappointing to hear that others have experienced this and brought it to Fitbit's attention. I was told by one of the people I spoke with on the phone that my call was the first they'd heard of this.
How would we find out?
Hi I get a sleep score of around 88 most nights and on average I sleep 6:30 to 6:45 hours. I seem to manage well on less than the recommended sleep length! A solid 8 hours is almost impossible for me, unless I have to catch up on a few bad nights, which happens very rarely. My highest score is 94 and that was on 7:20 h sleep which I get a few times a month. I don’t meditate but do 20mins yoga a few times a week and love gardening. But I struggle to get to bed at the same time each night, I am a night owl!
I'm wondering if you may have sleep apnea. I was diagnosed about 10 yrs ago after my wife noticed that I would stop breathing while I slept. I would often suddenly wake up, pulse racing, sometimes breathing as if I had held my breath for some time... I don't fit in any of the typical physical characteristics of the sleep apnea 'norms'. I'm thin, active, with a normal resting HR around 46-50. Please see a doctor if this sounds like what you are experiencing. It may be placing undue stress on your heart.
Thank you, JohnnyRow.  Here's the photo I wanted to paste before.  How does my O2 look to you?
Hey @RobertoME! I found those tips and they have been really helpful. Sometimes relaxing music before going to sleep helps too!

Has anyone found any useful way to exercise, or specifically weight train, without clenching your jaw and then having jaw pain for all day? I've clenched my whole life and have only recently realized I need to find a whole new way of breathing while I lift.
does anybody know if sleep clinics or doctors take fitbit data seriously or do they think it is just a gimmic?

@veloron2008 wrote:New Fitbit Alta HR user here.  I've had two very restful nights of sleep in a row, and the Fitbit tracker recorded <1 hour in deep phase each time out of 7:30 total sleep. I know this is false for a few reasons: First, I subjectively feel very fresh and rested upon waking. No drowsiness whatsoever. Second, I also am still using my old trackers for comparison (a Misfit Ray and a Mi Band 2), both which indicated more than 35% of total in deep sleep. I also recall several dreams which makes me skeptical of such a high % of light sleep. I am a vivid dreamer, especially since supplementing with Magnesium at night. Finally, I awoke at least once last night because of tingly hands due to staying in one position too long (side sleeper). That's an indication of deep sleep.  So now I'm reading that HR-based Fitbits use heart rate fluctuation in their calculations. Since I'm an endurance athlete with a resting HR in the low 40s, a few beats here and there is pretty significant.  I would say to other Fitbit users to take the sleep analysis with a HUGE grain of salt. Hi @veloron2008 , A few thoughts: The Fitbit number sounds more correct, sorry. I somewhat doubt you're getting 35% deep sleep nightly--that's double the average and would really cut into other stages. That you feel rested is great, but doesn't provide any information as to the cause of it being a huge amount of deep sleep. (In the time I've been here, I've never heard of deep sleep being reported so high). Here is a more typical chart: Often, we see the light sleep % higher, usually at the cost of deep sleep.   It's very easy to take our subjective experience, and try to link it to the sleep stage numbers and call that objective. But there are a lot of assumptions to doing that. A scientific study would be more accurate, at the cost of quite a bit of money. I think Fitbit's solution is a good value overall for what it is.

There is a difference though between waking and stirring in your sleep.My fitbit flex tells me I woke 3 times last night and stirred 16 times - meaning rolled over. It gave me a 93% sleep efficiency - I usually wake 1 time and stir 12 to 15 times.
hey Moishap,My sleep has actually been working pretty well lately.  Not sure if they finally fixed something or not. They originally told me that my phone was not compatible with my fitbit! LOL  so I bought a dongle for the computer and now everything seems to be going better.  The only thing I'm noticing now is it is switching back and forth between total sleep hours and actual sleep hours minus the times awake.. LOL.
I know I'm a little late to the party here, but my experience with and without my CPAP is literally a matter of life and death. When I use my CPAP (which is virtually, every night for the last thirteen and a half years), my sleep is pretty good in spite of the fact I A) drink copious quantities of green tea before bed time and need to pee a lot, and B) change sides frequently.  Here is a recent CPAP night: As you can see I did pretty well and had very stable O2 levels in my blood. Now look at the same view of the last time I didn't wear my CPAP (I broke a part) on 27-Jan-2020:
Mine today while feeling rested:Awake: 42 mins, 8% Rem: 1 hour 11 minutes, 14%Light sleep: 5 hours 48 minutes, 67%Deep sleep: 59 minutes, 11%(That is way more light sleep for me than typically) I don't seem to be able to find how often it registered me as awake, but those numbers are very similar. Maybe you need a bit more sleep than you realise, but is your body used to waking up at a certain time and ready to go. You can try to stay in bed for an extra half an hour to see how it responds.

Welcome to the forums @Jocelyn21! I kind of have the same story as you have:

 
Thing is, that I tend to overcompensate on coffee or sugary drinks to feel "normal" and I end up binge-sleeping whenever I have spare time. I had some blood work done a while ago and it turns out I have anemia, which explained my "tired 24/7" mood. 
 
If you feel like you are doing ok with little sleep, try to squeeze in a bit more on your day to day routine, and if it's not possible, make sure you are getting your micros and macros in check for healthy nutrition.

I know I have sleep issues but I didn't expect my Force to indicate just over 2 hours of restful sleep a night.Last night I decided to activate the sleep monitor without wearing my Force to bed.  The results were the same... 2 hours 22 mins of sleep.  Does anyone know how that is possible?Thanks
Hi, if I don’t use “begin sleep now” on my phone what should I be using. I just got a newer Inspire2 and it has the heart rate. TYIA
That's fantastic!!!! Absolutely awesome that you got an hour of deep sleep when taking a 4 hour nap! I'm sure you did feel refreshed!
Just figured it out....I had to go to the App Store and press hard on theFitbit app icon. That made the update screen pop up. It didn’t showpreviously but yeah!!! Thank you everyone (and my hubby who suggested thepress and hold)!
This happened again last night where it took 3 hours to fall asleep, after being tired enough to do so from 9.30. This is killing my deep sleep and impacting my performance during the day. Please help if you can!
the dip was for 30 minutes. The first 1-2 minutes and slightly before was REM (69-73), the next 15 minutes was light sleep (58-60), the last 8-10 minutes was deep sleep (52-53)and ended with light sleep (71-73). Other than this period, I went through REM, light sleep and deep sleep, with no major dips like this (mainly 69-72)
Hi @Tara19866 -  There are many recommendations about how to get good sleep. A good routine helps, such as no sleeps during the day and plenty of exercise with sunshine if possible and good diet, go to bed at the same time, wind down without tv/phone screens before bed, sleep in a comfortable quiet cool dark place. Put your worries away at bedtime, there's always tomorrow. If you have a restless partner try sleeping in another room and see if that helps. Most importantly be happy. See this article

Author | ch, passion for improvement.
Yes! My sleep tracking rarely shows REM or deep sleep when I have my bipap on. I also have days where I wake up feeling like I slept well when wearing it but my fitbit show under 30 minutes of rem.
Hi @DannyD_PNG - I can sympathize with your predicament. Unfortunately, the only way to currently get what you describe is to use a medical grade device. But the current blood oxygen variation graph can be a good tool to share with your doctor. Between the two of you, you can track how often the spikes occur and whether or not a CPAP machine is called for. When things got too bad, my doctor suggested a CPAP machine. I fought him on this. But when I finally gave in, the tracking on my Fitbit verified the improvement and also clearly showed how much better I was sleeping. I also shared this with my doctor.  Team work, with the help of my little Fitbit device.

are there things you might be doing before bed the stimulate you or your brain enough to allow you to fall asleep but not stay asleep. I have the same problem and I am always looking for patterns before bed. Are you on the computer reading things that stay with you or watching something that creates an emotional reaction. caffeine? Are you hungry. Write down what you do before and see if this give you an aha moment.

Also, what's your bed-time routine @Nunul ?  Do you exercise during the day so that you're well and truly wiped out, physically, when you go to bed?  Do you go to bed before you're tired or at the same time each night just because it's routine?  What do you do when you wake up - just toss and turn and get frustrated or do you read and listen to the radio to calm your brain down again?  How do you feel as soon as you wake up, both physically and mentally?  Maybe try reading a magazine when you wake up or listen to the radio so that your brain goes "must shut down again... it's not time to wake up yet" kinda thing? I hope you find something that works for you!

Hi there,
 
I've been finding my heart rate will dip down as I go to sleep for the first few minutes and then steadily rise over the night, with a few peaks. My average sleeping heart rate is higher than my resting heart rate so I don't think it's just REM/vivid dreams. It's almost like a reverse hammock, though seems worse at the beginning of the night and will sometimes dip down below rhr by 2am or so. I try to practise good sleep hygiene so don't drink or eat in the few hrs before bed, don't use screens, dark room, etc. Has anyone been through similar and worked out what it is please? (Can't work out how to post a screenshot!)
 
Hello,
Know this is from a while ago, but having the same.issue and wondering if you ever had any insight to it please?
 
Moderator Edit: Merged posts
The normal sleep setting was a joke for me.  I am a very light sleeper, and am awake for hours on end at night, yet the *standard* setting said I was geting 90% sleep and had me fast asleep when I was actually awake and playing on my phone or nursing my son in the middle of the night, repeatedly.  It even had me sleeping several times when I was actually up and walking around the house.   On sensitive mode it's much more accurate, catching most of the times when I'm awake in the form of *restless*.
Studies no but based on what my fitbit reports and how I feel there seems to be a decent pattern.  It is a tool and not a major medical device.  I do think the trends over time can be helpful to show a medical professional as it is some easy data to have when asked.
Hey,I thought my Fitbit Charge hr was supposed to track my lowest heart rate level?I woke up last night a few times and I saw far lesser readings.I have been reading about how the rest heart rate might be higher asleep than awake. Yet I did see numbers like 55, but the fitbit charge hr logged this time a 70.It's baffling to see this, but I'm just wondering if the system is designed to take readings in a certain time?

@WavyDavey has some solid advice and the pinned topic at the top is a good place to check.  Sleep certainly helps with helping to keep emotions in check and it becomes a catch 22 when you get behind on sleep but then can't sleep because your emotions/thoughts won't chill.  Aside from meditation I find just getting outdoors and spending some quiet time in the sun does wonders for helping calm emotions.  At least for me.  Limited screen time before bed and cutting caffeine and sugar out of your diet a few hours before bed also help a lot.  Good luck!
I agree that sleep tracking could use a little more sophistication and hope that fitbit can choose to improve upon it. But I'm not sure it's as simple as adding up time per "day". Has anyone noticed all of the "Sleep Stats" (the right column of the log) for a single "day" aren't satisfactorily accurate? _dt has one example. My example: my current "Sleep" record shows "Times awakened = 13". However, if I hover over "Apr 12" on "Times awoken over the past 30 days" I only see 7 times. That suggests to me sleep tracking is based on a midnight to midnight schedule. Therefore, in addition to being able to sum a "'day's' worth of sleep", tracking needs to be aware of what you consider the start to your "day". Let's not let mechanesthesia's "OVERBLOWN" (not my word) frustration detract from the fact that there is something wrong and it is worth making an effort to improve it. What would be your "requirements" to make the Sleep Tracker/Log more accurate?
Yes thanks, no not disputing accuracy at all. I understand how the Fitbitapp relates the percentages, but it seems more useful /important to knowthe percentage of Deep sleep achieved versus how much Deep sleep per nightis normal; perhaps more so than percentage of deep sleep vs light /rem /awake periods that are currently recorded.I know people who have been inconsolable in blogposts because their Fitbitsaid they "only got a lousy 2.5hrs deep sleep" (I should be so lucky!) notrealising that was actually good.
Rdymn, thx...good to know bedtime snack others too😀 and other options.Good luck in your fight against cancer and getting better sleep and health❤️
To clarify, my other trackers do not attempt to distinguish Deep Sleep from REM Sleep, so the ~35% includes both phases. According to your figure, that benchmark is actually 40% not 18%.  Fitbit puts my Deep Sleep plus REM at 18% of the total, which is absurd given the facts in my first post.  I maintain that the Fitbit algorithm isn't accurate, sorry.  Can you give some details how Fitbit uses HR to calculate sleep phases? Are fluctuations not more impactful to an algorithm for lower heart rates, than for higher heart rates?
I have a One and a Flex. It doesn't automatically register at all.

Also is there any way to know if I am in Deep sleep?
Back in June 2019 my doc prescribed Prozac. After a few days on Prozac I started sleeping about 12 hours/day, and it was really hard to drag myself out of bed. At the same time my fitbit HR sleep scores crashed.  Before taking the Prozac, my sleep score was right around 70 to 85, and sleep duration 6 to 9 hours.  Suddenly I was getting no sleep analysis at all, or very poor results. I've been off Prozac for 5 days now.  Trying out Cymbalta.  Two nights ago the HR gave me a really good sleep score.  Decent results last night. Has anyone had a similar experience of anti-depressants destroying their sleep analysis?
I am not sure to get it : you had 4 good nights where you slept 7-8 hours, and then a completely sleepless night where you did not any sleep at all ?
​Thanks, I appreciate the response! 🙂
Yea, for me its shown the sleep score every night that I've worn it to bed. Note that I stopped manually logging, I just go to bed while wearing it, it logs automatically. Next morning there is a sleep score. Hopefully you can get your scores too. Sweet dreams!
There has been discussion in some other threads that the accuracy of the sleep stage tracking is very much questionable. You are correct, there is no explanation for why changing the wake up time would significantly change the time spent in specific stages hours earlier.
>  feel this feature advertised by FitBit is not really ready for prime timeIt definitely seems that way. Sleep tracking was excellent on my original Charge HR. It would record my sleep every night, every day time nap I take. I loved it and that was the only reason a bought HR 2 once the old one felt apart after 2 years of continuous wear. Now the new HR 2 either logs one, two hours or does not log my sleep at all. I feel cheated by Fitbit.
I currently have a fitbit flex, but I'm considering getting a Charge HR now that I'm a fitbit superuser. I love tracking everything--especially sleep.  There is one point that I'm not 100% clear on with Charge HR and sleep. If the Charge HR tracks your heart rate continuously, shouldn't it use both your movement and your heart rate data to track sleep, making it more accurate than a flex, that just uses movement? Yet, none of the literature available on the Charge HR seems to confirm or deny this fact. If I knew for sure that it did, I would be at the store today! Add this to your literature, fitbit!
So my SPO2 graph spikes every now and again during my sleep, maybe 3 nights a week at random times. Only once a night or maybe twice.I’m worried this means I may have sleep apnea?! Does anyone’s graph spike like this for a reason that’s NOT sleep apnea?could it be too loose? Pics attached of normal and spiked readings on various nights. Any advice or similar experiences would be really appreciated. thanks 🙂
so, ive had my fitbit for 3 weeks or so now, the first few nights sleep it tracked i had slept 7-9 hours, but since then ive been sleeping 5 hours at the most but in bed for around 9-10 hours!im thinking this is the source of why i feel tired in the mornings instead of my believing ive slept for 10 hours!does anyone have any suggestions how i can sleep better? i didnt know i was a restless person at all, i thought i slept quite still as i dont wake myself up in these 'restless' moments.OR can i trust my fitbit to track accuratly of how i sleep.help is appreiciated 😄

A few weeks ago, I replaced my Charge HR with a Charge 2 for the simple reason that it couldn't track when I went to bed.  I have chronic fatigue syndrome so have sleep set to sensitive because the sleep time better matches how rested I feel.This has only been happening for the past 2 or 3 months or so, but the tracker (both of them) often logs me as going to bed 3 hours or 5 hours later than I did, and it's not unusual for it to claim that I never went to bed at all (as if I left the tracker on my nightstand).  To be clear, I am not talking about excessive restless or awake periods; the night's sleep chart doesn't even start until I've been in bed for several hours, so I'n not sure it's a matter of sensitive vs. regular sleep setting.I've played with the sleep log start time, but that has had no effect.  I sync to an iPhone and its software version makes no difference, nor does the Fitbit app version.  I restart my Fitbit every few days (an old computer habit).Anyone have ideas on why my tracker doesn't know that I've gone to bed?  Thanks.
So, I deleted the sleep record from last night.  I tried to create a new record with the correct times and here's a picture of what happens:  There are no sleep records for this time; I deleted the one I could not edit....... Thad
A very simple way to look at it is-- deep sleep is restorative to the body, while REM is more integration for the mind. With some practice, one can gauge internally between the two. Not enough deep sleep feels sluggish in the body. Physical performance can suffer. Not enough REM may show up as unclear thinking or memory trouble. At some point, the two are difficult to distinguish. With enough deprivation of deep sleep, the mind will have trouble, and with too little REM, the body may not feel that great either. So there's lots of overlap. But if you can get a sense of how each type of sleep affects your body and mind, it can be really valuable information.

Luckly i am european and the CPAP and it's service/maintance is free as long i have a prescription for it... Fitbit and i guess me changing my lifestyle is already showing in the Sleep report coming from the CPAP. My CPAP is set for a maximum pressure of 15 bar (218 psi) and its maximum pre Fitbit was always around 14.9  bar (217 psi)...Two months later of fitbit and last night's maximum pressure the machine used was 12.3 bar (178 psi) and it keeps lowering.
Hi there, I am not a Dr. but I notice the same thing when I am sick or fighting an infection. I am just now recovering from a very mild Covid infection (or what I believe is) and while running a slight fever my heart rate at night was over my resting heart rate during the entire night.

My partner noticed that they lately wake up around a certain time for no apparent reason.  That made me wonder about sleep patterns and, while the FitBit app shows some interesting information it's always "normalized" to percentages or total hours, while I wanted to see all the days aligned to the same grid of time and if there are patterns. I was able to do this manually by aligning partially-transparent screenshots of the web site in a graphics editor, but it was a lot of effort for just a small amount of data. As you can see, there aren't any very strong trends over this time, but I do tend to be awake certain times like 1:00am and almost always asleep around others like 4:00am. I'm sure this could be done much better by FitBit's analysis and design team, perhaps yielding some insights about environmental effects on sleep patterns. I'd also be interested to see it split by day of week to see patterns there, e.g., does the very early garbage pickup regularly interfere with my sleep?  Or does sleeping in on the weekend affect my sleep on Monday night? (https://i.imgur.com/sOb2Vj1.png)
@Amont I wonder if your sleep goal is set correctly. If you tap the Sleep tile in the Today screen of the Fitbit app and then the Settings gear on the upper right, you can check you sleep goal and change it if necessary.

I have used the Sleep Cycle iOS app, and really liked it... The only downfall was that I didn't like that I had to keep my phone plugged in all night with the app running. Not sure if you are able to keep the app running in the background now, but this would be an EXCELLENT setting for the Force, Flex, and One.I actually thought it was already an integrated feature, as the Jawbone Up has a Smart Alarm [ https://jawbone.com/kb/articles/310.html ] and this was one of the reasons I purchased a FitBit. Hopefully it will be added soon... 😢
I have had my Fitbit since late last summer, just a basic model, wear regularly.  I have been monitoring my sleep pattern.  I don't wear watches, never have and it took some time to get used to this on my wrist all the time.  However gradually over the last months I have found myself waking up with my left hand middle finger almost stuck bent and it has taken a while to get back to normal.  I have researched this and it appears to be something called Trigger Finger which is to do with the tendons from the wrist to the hand making the finger seem to "lock", a swelling in the palm at the bottom of the finger.  As the clip part sits directly on the tendons going to the hand could the Fitbit be somewhat responsible.  I don't wear it tightly but the instructions say to use on the non dominant hand.  Any ideas out there?
I have a similar problem: Sometimes I remove the last 15 minutes or so of my registered sleep, because in the graph it's shown as Awake anyways. After doing this I notice that for example my Deep sleep drops from let's say 50 minutes to 43 minutes, with a whole "chunk" removed from the graph. Or the other way around: my Fitbit adds minutes to one of the sleep stages, for example REM increases from 55 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes.
@kb000 wrote:Agreed! I am horrified about being graded and ranked on something that is already a stressful source of angst (and ironically makes it harder to sleep worrying!). Make sleep score optional, it's not a competition.  The previous implementation already benchmarked you against women/men your age (when looking at sleep stages). Here is my suggestion: remove the sleep tile altogether in the app. This way you no longer see any angst generating grading/ranking/benchmarking info related to sleep. Then, add a shortcut to https://www.fitbit.com/sleep. This way you will see time slept, including weekly averages, just like in the good old way system:

Hi there! I used to be like you, where I would be restless most of the night and no matter what time I got to bed I still woke up tired. A few things that have helped me are: - Read for 20 mins, then try to sleep (tires your brain and eyes out)- Make sure you are in a quiet and dark enviroment- Try drinking a cup of tea (no sugar) a half an hour before bed- Take a melatonin suppliment (helps you go into a deeper sleep and stay asleep), its naturally occuring in the brain and is what makes us sleepy so you are just providing the body with a little extra- AND.. when all else fails try to tire yourself out so much during the day that you fall asleep the second you hit that pillow! Hope this helps!
Cannot find it in my alarm clock app on Versa. I've installed the app only some days ago on Windows 10, so it should be the latest version, right?
Hello @SBAsMiMi. It's great to see you around! @SunsetRunner, @JohnnyRow It's great to see you around and thanks for your great input! 
 
Thank you for the detailed information and for the screenshots. Some users may experience errors in their reported SpO2 value due to arm position and movement, position and fit of your Fitbit device, and other factors.      To make sure your Fitbit device consistently tracks your SpO2 data:
-Wear your device slightly higher on your wrist.-Make sure your device is in contact with your skin.-Your device should be snug but not constricting.-Tattooed skin can impact the accuracy of the sensors on your Fitbit device. If you have any questions, please see help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2459.htm and help.fitbit.com/manuals/manual_spo2_en_US.pdf
 
On a side note, I agree with @JohnnyRow, the metrics within this feature are not intended to diagnose or treat any medical condition and should not be relied on for any medical purposes. It is intended to provide information that can help you manage your well-being. If you have any concerns about your health, talk to a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing a medical emergency, call emergency services.
Hope this helps.

I actually used to do a similar visualisation thing. I’d be back on the basketball court in high school shooting 3 pointers, they’d all go in no matter what angle, and I’d get the satisfying swoosh of the net. I don’t know but something comforting about it or something. I used to really love basketball as a kid.Sent from my iPhone
That is exactly how it is working for me. I have never gotten the tap mode method to register any sleep activity tracking on my dashboard. That is not to say my Flex doesn't go into sleep mode, it does do that, it's just that no logging occurs.I have always had to manually log the sleep in the morning or use the start sleep and wake mode options from the iPhone app.
I wear it on my left (non-dominant) hand, sensitivity set to normal. Youcan, in fact, adjust sensitivity even after logging your sleep. But itshould still show the same graphs in the middle of night, no matter if Ifall asleep at 6:00 or 6:05, for example.That's what I am talking about. Fitbit still logs same data, "movement", soit should produce same graphs based on those data. Now, I have 2 options:have accurate fall asleep / wake up times or have accurate restless records.
As luck would have it, for the first time this night, my Breathing Rate is also not showing up
… last reply got cut off mid way!i am trying to get any doctor to take me seriously on this: no one seems to think it’s an issue, but it is an issue. Poor sleep links to so many other chronic health issues. I’m planning on going back to the GP and trying to insist they refer me to a sleep clinic.if at least one of us can get answers it may solve the mystery for all.ps… the only possible theory I found is that it’s caused my longstanding anxiety.I had burn out 15 years ago and I’m wondering if it reprogrammed my anxiety response and I’m now in some kind of permanent state physically.i don’t feel overly stressed - at least not every single day … but maybe I’m just used to it now.have you suffered from anxiety?
You are right (obviously).  I was thinking non-premium showed the components.  But now at least you know what the components are and what fraction each counts, even though you cannot see the scores on each.

Hi Emily,My Surge is logging sleep as awake and vice versa. any idea how to change that?
Hello to you too! From this article about sleep stages: Why don't I see sleep stages today?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your device’s battery is critically low. I hope this helps!

Does Fitbit Versa Lite get a smart wake?
What am I missing here? There doesn't seem to be anything "extra" within the Sleep tile on the dashboard. I click on it - and it will let me add or change a sleep record, and the tile shows me the usual information - but I don't see anything to suggest that it would remind me that it's time to unwind and go to bed. Not that I need that - but honestly, there are times when that would be helpful.  I don't see this option and I feel like I've clicked through every thing clickable.

This is just a thought, but maybe you should try some yoga. It might help with both sleeping and with busy thoughts.
I have had the Flex since Christmas and have recorded my Sleep History every day sine.It looks good to see ones sleep/sleepless hours but I have not found any real use for this part of the programSomeone else may have an answer or Fitbit may help.

I have kind of a similar situation.  Back when I was majorily obese, I slept at the drop of a hat, and 8 hours wasn't hard at all to get.  Now that I'm exercising daily, and lost 43 lbs, I find that I'm sleeping a little more.  At one point I was only getting 5 hours of sleep.  I was FULL of energy, and never tired.  But that was when I was exercising every other day.  Now that I've switched to daily 3-5 mile walks weather permitting or 30 minute stationary bike rides, I'm stuggling to stay up past nine.  And I'm getting closer to 6 1/2 to 7 hours now.  If I take a day off, I have a hard time going to sleep, and don't sleep as much.  Ever once in a while I get 8-9 hours, (About once a month) and I'll be like super man.  But most days I'm up by 5 or 6 AM, full on energy raring to go.  I'm almost NEVER tired anymore.  I feel like I'm in my 20's again...  Not bad for a 48 year man, with 53 more lbs to lose...So for me increasing my exercise to every day, help me get more sleep.

Hi, @dasboot , obviously how you feel is a better indication than any “score”!  And equally obviously, Fitbit is not a medical device (or a mind reader)... The ‘sleep score’ aspect of Fitbit is very new, so I would say only time will tell how well this works for any individual. I would recommend looking at your trends over time and see if your recent experience continues or if you find that, despite occasional blips, you do get any valuable insight into your sleep pattern.   My personal experience is so far a little varied, but for myself I noticed that over the last 3 nights, for example, I have had very similar hours in bed (just over 7).  Friday I got a ‘fair’ with 64, Saturday I got a ‘poor’ at 55.  I was certainly yawning and feeling grumpy and tired all afternoon on Sunday, so probably about right... Last night I got a ‘good’ at 81 (although only 3 minutes difference in sleep time) and so far I really do feel much better than I did yesterday.  So I am sticking with it, for now, and seeing how it goes... And, btw, I didn’t look at my score for those 3 days until I replied to you... So my feelings weren’t influenced by the score.  I genuinely felt badly underslept all weekend, felt better today, then looked at your question and at my own sleep score...

Sense, Charge 5, Inspire 2; iOS and Android
Yes, I am wondering the same question...are there concrete methods to improve sleep?  The first night I tracked it, I only slept 3 hours and 19 minutes out of the 8.5 hours I thought I was sleeping!  No wonder I'm exhausted a lot!  Last night was a little better and I felt like I had slept worse...hmmm???  A good night's sleep is so important, I'd love to hear some ideas!  Thank you....
Hi @PerfectBlue, I don't think currently there is a way to overlay HR and sleep data. You could print out the HR chart, then mark with a pen where REM sleep occurs. I would think the extra sleep activity is probably triggering Awake time more than REM, but let us know what you find out.What is your average REM and Awake time?

I'm in the same boat. It was accurate when I first got my fitbit, and now it doesn't even show when I am restless when I know I have been tossing and turning.

Moderator edit: subject for clarity
In general, I find when altering the sleep times, I sometimes accidentally alter the date to be "last night", when it should be "tonight". This will cause it to try and create a sleep record that spans an entire day, and gives stats similar to what you posted. If you'd like us to see the chart, post it on a free image site like Imgur, and then post the link to it here. Not all of us use FB.

Thank you, Ann, for taking your time writing an answer. Unfortunately, I lost hope in fixing the problem. My versa2 works fine. The heart sensor works fine and I have been using it for almost 3 years now. So, I am thankful that it still works in perfect condition after the 2-year warranty. The problem seems to be in the app and all the changes they made and that is really frustrating. Maybe whenever there is a new update it will fix itself. Thank you againMonika
Hi - I am interested in getting a Fitbit with a SmartWake. I used to have another tracker with this feature and absolutely loved it. From what I see, it is currently available only on the Versa 2 and there will be a firmware update for it on the Charge 4? Has this update come yet for the Charge 4? Are these the only two devices that have the feature? Thanks
Sadly I have a kids smart safe phone so I only have the website my mom is the one with it on her phone so there is no way to join a group without a compatable phone then?
If anyone from the Fitbit app development team bothers to read this, please look at the actual  numbers of people who want these features to be optional.  The suggestion (linked above) to add “sleep score” to mobile had 208 upvotes.  The suggestion to “make sleep score optional” (also linked above) currently has 695 upvotes.   The community clearly doesn’t want sleep score to be forced on us.   It should be buried, like the cardio fitness score.
Fitbit suggest there are a few reasons this can happen: "WHY DON'T I SEE SLEEP STAGES TODAY?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your tracker from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely.

I just learned of an app called Mobile Sleep Doc (http://www.mobilesleepdoc.com/) that tracks sleep. I have only been using it for a couple of days now but it works similarly to Fitbit but with the added bonus of taking any medical/sleep sysmptoms you might have and seeing if they add up to a possible sleeping disorder/issue. It links with Fitbit and has givne me some good tips to sleep better. So far I'm liking it but still need to test it out more.
You can make this change from sensitive to normal in device settings.

	May the Force be with you. Han Solo
Thank you! That was exactly the right solution. Don't know if it will also work for those whose Fitbit is under-reporting sleep patterns as well. Funny how I couldn't find that answer anywhere on the website from Fitbit itself.
Thanks for bringing my attention on EOV, I somehow had missed the announcement about the whole thing, and hadn’t noticed there was some more stuff after the "sleeping heart rate" graph. Unfortunately, I can’t answer your question, as I’ve never been involved with CPAP machines and my EOV graphs all seem to be pretty much flat in the low variation area. I would imagine a single spike now and then would not be of concern / would not warrant a sleep study.

What does your app say about seeing simple sleep. Was the period over 3 hours? Was their a consistant heart rate? Is heart rate turned on?

My best score was a 91. It happened a couple of months ago. In almost 4 years of Fitbit use, that's the only time I've been in the 90s. I'm usually in the mid-80s.

@MCWS  Restarting doesn't cause you to lose any of your data. It's similar to rebooting your computer or phone. You might not need to do a restart. You didn't mention which FitBit you have. If it's the Flex, are you tapping it to sleep mode or doing it on your phone? We'll figure this out.

Thanks guys for listening! I feel better. 🙂
I just downloaded the spo2 clock for my versa 2 a couple hours ago and it’s reading  78-81 but I’m breathing fine so I’m questioning the accuracy of this
I had this same thing happen last week.  I have checked my sleep data religiously for the last two plus years and that is the only time it happened.  I was obviously up, walking the dog, going about my normal day when it said I was sleeping for two hours longer after I initially woke up.  I am thinking there was a one time glitch?  I wouldn't return your device and use a note pad.  Like I said, it happened ONCE in over two years of tracking. I, too, edited and was worried about losing everything.  They need to be more specific on telling us what will be lost if we edit.  Good luck to you!!  Just my thoughts. . .
He is probably a moron! If you feel that you are not satisfied you should Persue it, at the end of the day you know yourself better than anyone else. People are effected by things in different ways hence why we Arnt typically categorised by groups but known as individuals 🙂
Additional screenshots: From the dashboard, I can see that the time buckets are in 5 minute increments: Dashboard Granular With the "Heart Rate Zone" chart, it shows a spike to 141 at exactly 1:45 am - how could the "average" from 1:45 to 1:50 am be 59, if there was a spike of any real duration to 141 during that time period? Heart Rate Zone Granular
Hmm, maybe it's when you're sleeping. I've read that people tend to get the most restful sleep between 10 pm and 6 am. (I try to get to bed by 11:30 and get up at 5:40, but then my body seems to like getting between 5 and 6 hours of sleep.) I do have periods of restlessness, but it's rare that I have more than 10 minutes a night unless it's a weekend, when I tend to sleep more. Unless your job requires you to work odd shifts, you might want to consider changing the times you go to bed and get up.

Just as the Fitbit app can exchange data with apps such as MyFitnessPal, it would be nice if it could get sleep data and resting heart rate from apps such as Azumio's Sleep Time, for those of us who have a Zip that doesn't track sleep.
Sleep stages feature, particularly the benchmark analysis feature, I am compared against average woman of my age. Note that this occurs even though my Personal Information in Fitbit account correctly lists me as a male. Anyone have any similar problems and associated solutions?
Why would you implement this as mandatory.  I personally liked the old way.  The new sleep score is too convoluted, I just want to see the time slept!!!!!!!!!!
I realize this won't satisfy you, but for what I said, my Versa timer does wake me up in 30 minutes by vibration at end of timer interval. And I know this will not satisfy you either, but I suspect part of the issue is false-positives vs. false-negatives.  In order to get 15 minutes of sleep recognized, is one willing to put up with 15 minutes of meditation or quite TV watching also getting incorrectly recognized as sleep.  I don't know the answer.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
do you get a sleep read out when you sync but don't "record your time go tobed, and time, leave bed"?
Thank you!  I will change the setting and see how that works.

Hi @Merkillin From the Heart rate FAQs  Resting heart rate refers to the heart rate measured when you’re awake, calm, comfortable, and have not recently exerted yourself. Your tracker estimates your resting heart rate by measuring your heart rate while you’re asleep and while you’re awake but still during the day.For best accuracy, wear your tracker to sleep.  If you don’t wear your tracker to sleep, the tracker will still try estimate your resting heart rate while you are awake.Resting heart rate is usually higher than your heart rate while you are asleep, so don’t be surprised if your resting heart rate is higher than the lowest number that you see in your heart rate graphs.
I had given up on my CPAP for close to a year.  When I started looking at my nighttime oxygen levels (a LOT of orange spikes), I got it out and started using it again- WOW! only a couple spikes in over a month. -how is that reading for you?(I have a charge 3)
Anyone out there burn the midnight oil? I currently work 3rd shift as a lab tech, so my sleep schedule can be quite rocky sometimes. Been doing it for about 5 years now, and I can manage to get an adequate amount of sleep about 90% of the time. It's the other 10% that leaves me feeling like death. Anyone have any tips/methods that help you sleep better when the whole world around you is wide awake? If I had to put in my two cents, I'd say the best investment is a set of blackout curtains for the bedroom. I've also tried to limit my caffeine intake past a certain part of the morning, and that's helped a lot. Oh, and feel free to add me as a friend.

You poor soul. Sounds like sometimes you can barely make it through the day!
I cannot understand why my sleep data is showing gaps in time I was asleep.It shows pretty accurately when I went to bed, if I got up for a couple of minutes (bathroom, drink, pet the cat, etc) and then continues when I went back to sleep.The problem is that it frequently shows three sleep periods in one night.  One will end with showing me asleep.  Then there will be a time gap of one to three hours (and I was still in bed asleep) but this time is never accounted for; and then begin ANOTHER segment showing me still asleep.  This might once again show me awake for several brief intervals (I am sometimes a restless sleeper) and once again it ends with showing me asleep.There will be another unaccounted for time gap when I was not awake, then sometimes a third segment is shown beginning with me asleep. Why is this happening.  I could even understand beginning a new tracking after I had been out of bed for a few minutes during the night (bathroom, drink seeing if it was snowing, pet the cat, etc) and then went back to bed. I cannot get why one segment ends WITH ME ASLEEP and another begins an hour or more later WITH ME STILL ASLEEP. I have begun jotting down every time I actually wake up enough to get out of bed and move around for 3-5 minutes and those are shown pretty accurately. I also do tend to wake up briefly more than once each night but not get up; these are depicted nicely as well.  I have NO idea why there are these long spells of time where nothing is shown--one time ends with me asleep, then there is they mystery segment of an hour or two when apparantly I died and had no heartbeat; then there I am again (asleep) in a new tracking segment.Any ideas what is going on here?I have also noticed that even when there is no unaccounted for time, sometimes the tracking seems to be split into two or three strips, one below the other, but at least then there is no lost time; the first will end with me asleep at , oh say 1:50AM and the next, showing below the first, will show me asleep at 1:51AM, etc. Other times it just goes in one continuous line.Additionally I wonder why the blue perpindicular lines that show you are asleep are very close together sometimes and further apart at others; any reason for that? All answers much appreciated.

I have had the same issue for  years, I believe it was the contributing factor to me developing fibromyalgia.  I have tried all the things listed in the various suggestions without luck.  I even tried multiple medications.  My sleep study showed I rested about 50% of the night, I never got into deep sleep. What I have had the best success with is cognitive behavioral therapy.  My issue at bedtime is that my mind races, either thinking of things I needed to do in the next days or weeks or I would dwell on things I didn't get done or things I said that I regretted.  I could not shut down. I tried meditation, I tried doing the relaxation techniques of focusing on various body parts but inevidently my mind would go back to racing thoughts no matter how hard I tried to focus on the relaxation technique of the day. What has finally started to work for me is to listen to the congitive therapy sessions while trying to get to sleep.  That has enabled me to focus on what was being said instead of my mind being off to the races.  I tried using the practicing the techniques that the videos say you should use without listening to the audio but if I don't actively listen, it doesn't work, my mind wanders. There are sessions available on you tube which should help you to get relaxed.  Best of luck to you!
Well finally the flex bit is working properley, DKEwatson was right.  It takes a little getting used to the taps.  I have managed to log 5 nights of my sleep cycle so far without any glitches.  What I did notice is the following: 1.  Tapping at the top part of the band where the lights show up is the best place to turn on your flex fit.  (not directly on the lights just bit bellow) 2.  When you see 2 lights flash you turned it on sucessefully 3.  When you see all five lights flash and a little gettle buz on the wrist band then it is turned off. 4.  First couple of syncs will appear several hours afterwards. So check back in a couple of hours. 5.  After you synced your flexfit for several times it works fantastic.... Hope it all makes sense..........and help
I've never heard about the 1.5 increments. Do you have any links to that? My REM doesn't follow along 1.5 hour schedules. It looks more organic than that. I have a hard time imaging the human body working along such a tight schedule...? The periods of wakefulness don't adhere to any logic I can see. Sometimes they are very brief and broken up. So I don't see any way you could time waking up around those.I always aim for net sleep, that is, adding time to account for the wakeful periods.

I would add:- go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekend.- preferably go to bed 1-2 hours before midnight- do a routine 30 min before going to bed: change in PJ, brush your teeth, etc ...
Hi @zzzz1, Do you have any sense of what it causing you to wake up? Is it to go to the bathroom? Do you work out in the evening ever? Do you find your mind doesn't want to stop once you're awake? I belong to a strength training community that has a lot of 40+ year old lifters. And waking up in the night or early morning is a fairly common issue reported. So you're hardly alone in this regard.

How do you get the "Floor" function to show activity on the dashboard when walking stairs?
Yah that is what I'm wondering about too. I don't have sleep apnea or anything but I do move a lot throughout the night. I've only noticed the lines since the new cycle stages graph came out and I never saw it on the old graph that just showed awake, restless, and asleep.
I have tried this method. No electronics, complete darkness, and each of those sup's for a 30 day run. The best thing that works for me is exhaustion.  Go one night with no sleep and really push it in the gym the next day. Then I will sleep like a baby for 3 of 8 hrs the next night. I know that this isn't recommended, healthy, or the norm. Just stating what my normal@Paleoproof wrote:The best way to improve sleep is to make your bedroom completely dark, blackout shades, no electronic devices with LED lights remove yourtv from the bedroom. Supplements that work are magnesium, melatonin,valerian root andkavakava.is.
I have the same challenges.   I am up anywhere from 1-4 times a night to pee (I drink a lot of water throughout the day).   My old fitbit (one of the earliest) understood this. My nightly sleep pattern showed and broke out each sleep chunk wether an hour or several hours long.    My present fitbit (charger 2} does not.   According to it, I have only slept about 10 hours in the last two weeks (initial sleep to first pee break), less if you factor in restless sleep.   Am I dead?   Am I dreaming that I am living?   The first fitbit didn't ask for sleep parameters.  Can I eliminate these?  I'm retired and my sleep schedule changes whenever I need it to.
Confused about how exactly to enter sleep for the night BEFORE this morning. I'm entering time going to bed the 'just past' night ("previous"), followed by the time I woke up TODAY. Is that right?  I log those times AFTER syncing my tracker in the morning. Is that right?
I am really excited to have the new sleep stages, except for one issue. When I tried to edit the sleep log (for example, if it says I went to sleep at 11:30, when I really went to sleep at 10:00 pm), I lost everything. It didn't even kick it back to the old sleep log. Nope, EVERYTHING is gone. How do I fix this?
Thank you for the suggestion. I don't see that setting the time asleep eachday manually is an acceptable solution. The whole concept of having awearable tracker is that it is convenient and manually editing time as anextra step is not.regards--Terry Rimmer
Before getting my fitbit, I used an app called Sleepbot.  With that you can even record your movements and sounds such as snoring.  Because I had used that a while, I am comfortable using the fitbit sleep log.  It seems to be pretty close.
I had this problem also, but I discovered if I kept trying to log it into the website, it would eventually log my sleep. I also wear my flex to sleep. Here's how I solve the problem: The website will tell me that I forgot to log my sleep but logs everything else okay. I know that I set my flex properly for sleep.  I then close the website and go back in. If that doesn't work, I use the little reload arrow in the address bar. Sometimes I do this once or twice. It then logs my sleep appropriately. While I'm doing this I make sure my wrist is near my computer. I usually only have to do this once or twice. Occasionally I have to do it three or four times. Try it and see if it works for you.
Hi @Shepherd123 - Nice to see you here in the forum!  what have you been trying to get your routine and sleep back in sync?
i think the point of sleep score is to analyze all the different sleep patterns you have, ive been reading about my own sleepscore and it uses word such as REM and light sleep, restless which is super interesting because i believe that if you sleep more then 8 hours you have a pretty good chance of losing weight so use it to analyze your sleep patterns and see where you can improve
There is in fact some kind of  "fat score", it’s called BMI. Arguably not invented by Fitbit, but it’s there "forced" on each of us, including graph with ranges labeled as "under", "ideal" and "over". If you don’t want to see the sleep score, just remove the sleep tile from your app. I thought one of the reasons for getting a Fitbit was to help us have a healthier lifestyle. This includes breaking bad news too.

Hi, i am a french person and i have a little bit problem to read english, could somebody help me to program the fitbit for sleep ? i tried but nothing. thank you
@Jere100 Has it been a while since you last restarted your Fitbit?
Yes I did!
I have just got the versa 2 and I wanted it pretty much for the sleep app. I’ll press the sleep now and it will only log an hour or 2 of my sleep when I press awake in the morning. Plus this this has a mind of its own too with reminders... hmmmmmmm.
OMG you guys! This book! It's a fundamental outlook on the things/habits that cause disruptions or affect our sleep in some way. The book is composed of 21 chapters with tips on how to make subtle changes in our daily lives in order to create a more recuperative and rejuvenating sleep. So far, mind blown! These things are so easy to incorporate! Some as simple as 30 minutes in direct sunlight every day to as complex as our hormonal homeostasis. I'm loving every minute of this book. Anyone else reading it?
I am probably not completely following, but you can set alarms on your fitbit to wake you up.. I have mine set for every morning- different times depending on what day and what I need to accomplish.

This is a pretty accurate description of how my sleep has been since I started tracking at the very end of last year.
The time is correct for hours in sleep mode, but it reflects a perfectsleep with zero interruptions which is not the case. Just wondering howaccurate it is for sleep tracking.
Well, after ten days of no spikes, I had two last night.  I checked and my heart rate did not change at all during those spike periods, which it would have if I was not getting enough oxygen to my organs.  Therefore, I think you are correct, these occasional spikes don’t mean much, and are probably in some way related to unusual movement.
I would suggest getting an appointment with a sleep specialist doctor orhaving a sleep study. If they rule out the medication then you may have asleep disorder. It is not normal for one to lie down and be asleep before 8minutes. I have narcolepsy and am asleep in 2.5 minutes after I lie down.Hopefully there is a lung specialist or sleep study doctor where you work.They will do a sleep apnea test overnight first before doing the multiplesleep latency test (MSLT). I am in an online narcolepsy support group onFacebook and you are not the only nurse with these types of symptoms.--Sabrina M.Riddell, ASMBC, BSBA, MBA
When I wake in the morning and feel pretty good I have a low score.  Days i wake and still exhausted I'm getting a higher score. Not sure I am thrilled with Fitbit. Been using for 2 years.
I think it is correct. eg today is wednesday and 'last night' sleep pattern shows under wednesday column which, as most of the hours of sleep are wednesday morning then technically that is correct?

If any doubts, certainly worth talking to your doctor about.But, in my opinion, which isn't worth much here with no medical training and far from an expert in interpreting these charts, my takeaway would be that your SPO2 variation is low for most of the night.  With apnea, I would expect to see a chart hovering about  the base line with frequent excursions above it throughout the night.  I wonder if you can correlate awake time, if any, with those times when it goes to higher variation because SPO2 increases when awake.

Thanks so much Dave, I downloaded the f lux on my mac!
I am asking Fitbit (not other users who do not need more flexibility). Since they have a lot of users, many of whom may need some flexibility to capture variations in their sleep or activities or HR. If enough people could use the info on summing up fragmented sleep or short nap, Fitbit should offer an option (e.g., experimental algorithm for immediate daily input that people can turn on/off, if difficult to implement long-term tracking for website or averages, etc.). If everyone falls nicely in the profile that provides optimal true-positive/true-negative (SE, SP) for the general population, Fitbit would not be able to sell such a large number of users. Many people use monitors that would help tracking their variations.
Yes @2run4it! Meditation does help a lot to fall back asleep.

Hi,This has been covered elsewhere in the forums, but I'm yet to find an answer (sorry if there is one, I'm very tired).I bought a Versa 2 yesterday, wore it for the first time last night and have all the sleep data re Sleep Stages, but 'No Sleep Score - Not enough quality data was collected' it says in the app, and I cannot find any further information with respect to this, or how I might resolve it.If anyone can offer assistance I would be very grateful.(Also, I've tried to attach a screenshot of the app to this post, but when I go to attach image, and copy and paste (or drag) the j-peg to the 'source' field, the jpeg doesn't appear.. I'm so tired and this is doing my head in lol.. please help?)Thank you kindly
I think I found something that works most of the time. I delete the one entered automatically and log in the start and end time manually. It then seems to log it properly, with the various levels of sleep, most of the time. I have a few days where it has changed light sleep to restless and doesn't count it as sleep.ThanksRon
When you log into the desktop Fitbit Dashboard, go to Privacy Settings, scroll down to the bottom where you'll see the Sleep Data line.  If the icon is a LOCK, change it to the FRIENDS icon (2 people).  That should share the sleep data with only friends on your lists and not to the public.
I think doctors are beginning to look at Fitbit data. I was just at the dr's office this week and I was showing him my heartrate data. He said that he'd been seeing it a lot lately from his patients and he has found it to be accurate. So I think that as doctors see it more and become more familiar with the available data, it will be used more. Hope you feel better soon, @JohnRi.
I have just switched from Charge HR to Charge 3. The information section mentions sleep benchmarks and even shows a graph, but I cannot figure out how to get the graph to show. I do see the graph of my own sleep, but the benchmarks overlay is not there. Suggestions?

I was wondering how accurate the flex sleep tracker is. I know I don't sleep well, but I am normally getting 5 hrs of sleep or less. I go to bed between 10 and 11 and don't get up until 7:30. Is the accuracy off or am I really not sleeping that well at night?

@TheDoctorClara, how much awake time did you have for the night posted above? And how much REM? Too much awake or two little REM can both cause fuzziness/tiredness the next morning.

I've followed these steps over and over. The sleep reminder keeps turning back on. It won't stay off. It's annoying! I ended up setting my reminder for the middle of the day so it wouldn't wake me.
I meant to say I got 1 hour and 19 minutes of deep sleep. I couldn't go back and edit it. Anyway, that's the most deep sleep I've ever gotten while tracking it on Fitbit. I think it probably means move more, sleep better. And I think if you're moving more, then naturally you are not tied into electronics as much. I thought disconnecting from electronics was the key but not if you're going to just go sit somewhere else, like read a book. You need to move more. That's what I'm finding anyway. Would love to know if anyone else has discovered this with themselves.
I totally agree with you. I started having sleeping problem since beginning of 2015. I've seen doctors and acupuncturists to solve the problem. Nothing helps cause I've been wearing fitbit this WHOLE time during sleep.But recently, I started taking fitbit off, and turn bluetooth off on my phone. I sleep wayyyy better. I think some people are very sensitive to bluetooth magnetic wave. And I'm trying to leave my phone at least 5 feet away from my pillow.
if you are extra tired, its your body telling you its not getting enough rest. You don't necessarily have to sleep. just laying with your eyes closed and your mind shut off (or as close as you can come) for a half hour could restore you a bit so you feel more rested. I completely understand about not rocking the sleep boat- if I take a nap, I will go to bed later than my optimal bed time for falling asleep quickly (staying asleep is something else entirely). So on days I feel like I just need to rest- I set the timer for 30 minutes and just lay quietly.. it really does help.

I agree that for me at least Journalling helps with sleep. It relaxes me and calms my mind if I am stressed. A glass of warm milk helps me also.
My sleep activity has me going to sleep 2 hours after I actually do or more frequently 2 hours before i actually go to bed.  How do I remedy this?
Thanks JohnnyRow for your response.  Your first paragraph seems to answer my question with "No.  Taking a nap does not necessarily mean that your sleep score would improve:  it could, in fact, be lowered."  Your second sentence seems to referring to the next night's sleep. But as far as what I can tell, a nap is always added to the sleep that came before the nap:  it is never added to and does not directly affect the sleep (and score) which comes after it.  (Of course, a nap could affect the next night's sleep score, just because you might not sleep as soundly, but that seems a different matter.)And thanks for the second paragraph about detecting naps which explains that part well.
I understand but if the time awake during falling asleep and waking up is not accounted for, it is quite hard to get to 8 hours of sleep per day...
The Red ticks on the graph could be as mentioned below, due to turning in your sleep, temperature (restlessness) I have loads of a minute of less - these normally occur during or as you are about to come out of light sleep - the ones you need to check more is the ones over 3 mins to see if you can correlate them with anything (ie getting up for a drink of water etc) - my under a minute can range from 15-40 ticks over a 4h -5h45 min sleep period (this will show in the red bar as ie 21x awake) 16 of those may be small ticks from turning over, throwing off bed cloths or pulling them up/tighter around you) I am guessing your meds are amino acid supplement based (most common) - has your doc mentioned whether or not a change in diet could possible reduce the need for them - im not a medical expert and I am sure there is more to it but sometimes diet can help in some cases., glad you feel better and hope it continues - the day after is always more fulfilled after a good rest Kind Regards Wayne

I am averging about 17 times a night. I knew I had an issue going on, this seems to confirm it.
I have been through sleep testing, overnight at the hospital. My breathing is too shallow so my oxygenation level stays very low. On the Fitbit graph this means I see low variation because the problem is consistent: I’m not getting enough oxygen all night.  The graph is not helpful for me.
Where you see that purcentage on your sleep qualify?
As I stated in my original posting, I have turn the device on and off, numerous times, I have checked all the settings, numerous times, all to no avail. I have checked fitbit’s help topics and there has been nothing addressing this issue. How does one get fitbit to reply to  these complaints?
I agree that the changes in the sleep report ruin the purpose of having the darn thing. I and my husband have our trackers set on sensitive and are trying to figure out if sleep apnea is an issue. Now we can't examine our restless segments and see if they coincide. To the guys in the tech department: this didn't help: Please swap the sleep report to where it was. Thanks.
I tried online chat support and all they did was get me to reboot my Fitbit and confirm my iOS and app were up to date.   The follow up email was even worse.... 2 links to standard Fitbit articles on sleep.     Either they don't understand what I am asking or they don't care.  I think it's a bit of both.   I was going to upgrade to one of the new models coming out in September.  Not so sure now.
I am using my "sensitive" mode to track my sleep. It registers 4 to 5 hours of sleep per night. Last week I went to my sleep clinic for an all night sleep study. I wore my HR Tracker. I was very pleased to see that the results of the sleep study and my tracker were very, very close in sleep efficiency and sleep/restless time.
Caffeine has various advantages and is devoured by 91% of the US populace.A solitary portion can improve center, vitality and sports execution.Be that as it may, when devoured late in the day, espresso invigorates your sensory system and may prevent your body from normally unwinding around evening time.In one examination, devouring caffeine up to six hours previously bed altogether declined rest quality.Caffeine can remain lifted in your blood for 6– 8 hours. Along these lines, drinking a lot of espresso after 3– 4 p.m. isn't prescribed — particularly on the off chance that you are touchy to caffeine or experience difficulty resting.In the event that you do ache for some espresso in the late evening or night, stay with decaffeinated espresso.Are you agree with me?
@HelenaFitbitWell to some degree I have always used my phone before bed, but last night I turned my phone upside down and tried meditation for about 30 minutes before trying to go to sleep. What do you think??
I use a CPAP machine because of sleep apnea. My flex shows a difference in sleep patterns when I don't use the machine. I've also used a sleep monitor ap on my phone. I get results consistent between both devices.

I have a FItbit Blaze and when I enter manual sleep mode from my iphone app in the morning when I select Awake I get an error message a sleep log is already created. I have periods throughout the night where I wake up for an hour or more and what I am getting is up to 2 - 3 seperate readings from the autodetect mode. I am trying to use manual mode to 1) determine my initial time to fall asleep and 2) my sleep effeciancy for the night. When the autodetect is turning off and on (due to me waking up) i get errounous %s.  For instance last night I got 4.5 hours asleep broken up over 8.25 hours with 3 seperate autodetect lasting roughly 1.5 hours each.  This gave me 91%, 93% and a 90% sleep effeciency when it really is closer to 55% effecency. I was hoping the manual start would stop this behavour of the autodetect and give me one entry.  But for 3 nights in a row I get the same errror as listed above (Sleep entry already exists for this time period). I am hoping for a solution different from deleting multiple entries and correcting the first one as the others have restless periods.  I am coming from the Band 2 which the autodetect did not override the manual start. Thanks
yeah i think that it ahs something to do with your bio clock, i wake up at 8:00 every day except thursdays when i wake up at 7:30, i guess that is going against your doctors suggestion but it works for me,
Why did you go to Canada to have the surgery? I have bad sleep apnea and would like more details about it. thanks!
I have been thinking the same thing. Mine had two spikes into the yellow last night but most nights has none. I also wondered if it is how I have my arm placed because my son has mild asthma but a couple years ago he got the flu paired with his asthma it caused pneumonia and we spent a few nights in the hospital. Sometimes when he would be sleeping the oxygen level alarm would go off and the nurse would say it was just because he was sleeping on the arm his oxymeter way on, we would move him and sure enough it would go back to normal. I really think Fit bit should have given more detailed info on interpretation of this.
I'm not sure how this would actually be possible because depending on your activity levels the day before, your rate of recovery from exercise, and whether you're in perfect health or fighting a virus etc your need for sleep varies...  Also, would be wildly difficult to measure for women dure to hormonal changes. There are apps that can "monitor" your sleep and wake you up around a set time but do so during the lightest period of your sleep.

Gr4ndp4 | UKAWAKE! for morning in the bowl of light has cast the stone that set the stars to flight.
I frequently take naps after work that vary in length. My Alta actually will show if it's longer than an hour.
I switched to the SpO2 clock face and got a surprisingly low overnight reading. I talked to my doctor about it, and she ordered a nighttime oximetry test. Guess what - I have hypoxia. Fitbit was right! I start nighttime oxygen tonight. No CPAP yet.  And yes, my oxygen variation had spikes from time to time - usually more than this though. I've switched to Premium now, and ordered the Sense while it is on sale. Thank goodness my Versa found this issue!
Anyone know how to increase the silent alarm duration? I have an Charge HR and the alarm vibrates for two cycles which last about 6 seconds and does not wake me up. The alarm should go off until you shut it off. Also off topic but how can I have 160 steps for the day when I haven't even gotten out of bed yet? Very disapointing device.
Never solved.  Delta continues to be about 2% from daytime vs.sleep.  That said, it is within the measuring error of the devices of +/- 2%.  See the latest Oximeter vs. Fitbit plot below.   this is just short of 9 months of data.
My wife and I sadly missed the signup; our daughter was born on the 8th and then needed open heart surgery on Friday to save her life. I’m sitting on the floor of the cardiology unit in the top children’s hospital in Chicago this very moment, and have enjoyed comparing my Versa and wife’s Charge 3 to the various apple watches which seem to be extremely popular on this floor among the neonatal cardiologists and the specialist nurses constantly watching over our daughter. Understandably, our watches have attracted a lot of interest among the staff here. Would’ve been nice to show off this feature, as we seem to be the only fitbit users here. Looks like the beta filled up with people from other countries before we even got a chance to register, and I’d been watching pretty diligently for the signup ever since the notice got posted in fitbit labs. Oh well.
I would go with Normal at first.  If you feel the result are not accurate you adjust the setting accordingly.  Also pay attention to the Dominant vs. Non-dominant hand setting it does make a difference.

Not sure if there is a feed for this already, but I would like to have the option for my FitBit Inspire HR to have to option to connect to a Wake-up Light Therapy Lamp, such as the Philips SmartSleep Connected Sleep and Wake-up Light Therapy Lamp, Smartphone Enabled with Built-in Bedroom Monitor (HF3670/60) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GXWDXBD/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_i_UzF1DbEAC8EWR It's surprising FitBit does not have their own wake-up lamp yet. At least, when I called customer service the person I spoke with said that FitBit does not have any similar products.
When your precious body knows being up at the same time and when needing more sleep it let you know by being more tired earlier than normally. Going to sleep earlier is better than sleeping out, getting up later and later than otherwise and be tough to get back in the sleep routine. Regardless when going to sleep, always wake up just the moment before the light of the alarm goes on and before the tracker buzzes.
I have a glitch on my Charge 2 where it sometimes randomly goes up that high or a little higher (180s). It's a fault.
Maybe it is taken off as one would a watch before going to bed? Did you ask him/the personel that? It might sound obvious, but without having been there that would be my first thing to check. Do you have heart rate readings for night time?

I'm sorry but sleep stages do not work with the Surge. See: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163/
Im wondering if manually logging and fixing sleep tracking mistakes will give info to the algorithm to better track your sleep in the future? anyone from fitbit can shed some light on this?tks
@Batch.1 you'll probably get more and better replies if you start a new post with a new subject line and put it in the forum for the Versa 2.  I hope you can figure it out.  I have an Inspire, and I only get my sleep info on the phone APP not on the device and so I cannot help you.  Good luck.
Wowsers! I am sooooo envious - you get 2 hours of deep sleep, you lucky thing. I average about 30 mins, sometimes less... I think that the really short instances of 'awake' time are actually just 'restless' time rather than actually being properly awake. From what I have seen others post about their sleep patterns, this is pretty much 'normal'. Looks like you get pretty good sleep
I'm curious as to how many cals restless sleepers burn from midnight to when they wake up - for me it's about 450 cals (get up at 8am) Would also be good to know solid sleeper's results for comparing! I'm 6ft, female and 34. Not overweight. My sleep efficiency on sensitive is between 27% and 35%. Thanks to anyone who posts 🙂
I know you posted this a few months ago but... When you work out, even though immediately after you work out you might feel tired your body is actually waking up and getting invigerated by the exercise and stimulation causing you not to be able to sleep. Its always best to exercise no more than 4 hours prior to bed because of your bodies reaction. I would suggest getting up a bit earlier and doing a short workout prior to work.
Your Charge measures your sleep time from when it detects your sleeping.Your One uses the time your in bed, this is something your autobsleep can not currently do.If you want to try you can manually put your charge in sleep mode then compare.
Hey!Sleep apnea is not the only sleeping disorder that could be a reason for your lack of sleep. I have hypopnea which means I breathe very shallow when I sleep. So like with Apnea I don't get enough oxygen to my body when I'm sleeping. It's been about four years ago now, but I talked to my doctor about my concerns as I seemed to be sleeping all the time but always felt exhausted. She sent me in to have a sleep study done. It was like spending the night in a hotel room only with monitor leads hooked up to me. They were able to diagnose my issues after only a few hours of monitoring my sleep. I now sleep with a CPAP machine and average a 95% sleep efficiency on my fitbit. Things like Restless Leg syndrome, heartburn, nocturia (needing to pee a lot at night), menopause etc. can all cause sleep issues. I would strongly recommend seeing your doctor, as lack of sleep can bring on all kinds of other health issues. Bring a print out of your sleep efficiency for reference when you go. Good luck!

Same problem overnight - no patterns/stages.
It may be clearer how you calculate it, but I'm telling you it's wrong.On two nights where I didn't sleep until 4am then got up at 9am, having gone to bed at 10pm. They have multiple periods awake, in fact right up until 4am in both instances.They got scores of 85 plus despite the fact I woke up feeling spaced out and knowing I hadn't had a decent night's sleep.This is not an accurate method.
I think there may be a few variables here including your type of mattress.  When we were younger, we had an old-style mattress and when I got into bed it would affect my wife's movement and we would inevitably roll together.  Now we have a memory foam mattress and my movement's do not affect her. I have always known that I do not sleep well but my fitbit flex gives me a reading on how poorly I have slept.  Considering that I work shifts and my data when I am alone in bed are very similar to when my wife is with me indicates that her movements are not causing extra "restless" to be recorded.
I have a rather silly question myself regarding manual sleep logging (I JUST got a Fitbit One yesterday, set it up this morning). When logging sleep on the website you select the date and then the time you get in bed and when you get out. The (unreasonably) confusing part for me is this: Which day do you choose? the day you went to bed, or the day you woke up? I logged it as I went to bed on March 1 at 10:45 and got up at 7:03. But then my sleep tile on the dashboard shows that I didn't log sleep for today (March 2). I'm sure I'll get the hang of this eventually, but I don't think I'll be consistent in entering sleep mode on my One for a while (or I'll forget the end sleep mode in the morning). I don't have the app on my cellphone (too much memory requirement) or my home computer (no internet access at home), so I depend on either logging in to the website from my work computer, or using the app on my tablet when I have WiFi connection at work.
Hi. I can log my sleep but I can't find where to change it from normal to sensitive.  Thanks in advance for the help.
How many deep sleep troughs do others have? My typical night appears to start with a single trough of deep sleep followed by periods of light and REM. (Happy shiny people) Then some other nights I guess it looks more text book, with little deep sleep troughs scattered throughout. Not really sure how tired I am during the day because I'm either running around or chugging Monsters. 😉 What does your data look like?     Samples
My FitBit is in no way "a part of me".  It is simply an electronic device I use for a means of finding out info.  And I disgree that a FitBit is not a distraction in bed.  I can feel it on my arm and it is irritating.When it is next to me I don't have that problem. "Give it a try and see what you think."  As I already stated I have used it that way and choose to not use it that way any longer.
I think for anything deeper it will have to be a study done on you. Since we are all so different, what may be the answer for one is not for someone else, so they give general guidance. If you don't feel sleep deprived, then it is probably a normal sleep pattern for you and there is nothing to be concerned about.

Yes, this info is the same but still does not answer why Charge did not record from 3:15 a.m. To 4:35 a.m. as shown in gray on the sleep odometer icon on first screenshot that I sent.Thanks.Teresa 🙂

Nice tip there @katanel! Never thought the shape o the pillow had something to do with you sleeping well. 
 
What I normally do to get good sleep is drinking chamomile tea and a little bit of honey before going to sleep. It helps you relax, and since it's natural, it doens't have a side effect (of course, if you are not allergic). It works wonders for me!

My sleep pattern looks like the second image. However, before I look at my sleep pattern I'm getting a "Sleep Insights" box taking up a quarter of my screen. Is anyone else getting that? It only allows me to like or dislike; I can't get rid of it.
I am 29 but have had sleeping trouble since infancy (I rock myself during sleep. Also toss and turn like crazy. My mom said I started it at about 6 months old. I also after about 3 would be up till 1 am or later. Now I sleep at around 10 or 11) I typicaly eat a white meat, and a salad or white meat, potatoes and veggies.
Hi Dave,Clear you are living a better life than I am.. I have had my fitbit for nearly 3 years and have never achieved anything near 90 minutes of deep sleep. There are many nights where I get zero, and 10 -30 is common.  My all time high achieved once was 50 minutes. I am at the point in my life where I seriously need some cerebral spinal fluid washing out my brain at night. Thanks for your comment!
My fitbit versa 2 and software see a sleep window from 00:00 - 23:59 but for me, the realistic day and sleep window is from evening to evening. Is there a way to make the software reflect my realistic sleep window instead of this artificial one? My withings sleep analyzer and app do the Right Thing [tm], the hours I slept in the evening before 00:00 are counted with last night, so I did sleep just enough. According to fitbit I did not sleep enough.
I’ve never heard of that theory before and have slept with either A/C on, a ceiling fan on, or both most of my life. It improves my sleep because it makes the room more comfortable. However, neither is blowing directly on me - which I can understand could be a problem.
I bought one of those stretchy wrist band holder for an ipod or cell phone. i put the fit bit in the zippered section in its case and just roll the top down. No more catching the velcro of the fitbit band on my blankets and losing it in the covers overnight. 😀
I usually end up forgetting and logging my sleep manually later.
Hi @Heather-McD - As you guessed, we do not all need the same amount of sleep. I myself am one of those 7 to 7.5 hours folks. You can always google for more info. How are your sleep scores on those nights of less sleep?
I am having the same trouble with mine also. I don't know how to fix it and would like to know also. I hope we can get this fixed.
I have a fitbit Alta and I am having the same issue.  They told me to look for an update but the instructions I was given were a bust.  I am also no longer getting my heart rate????  I don't know why they can't have simple answers.
Thank you for sharing your experience with this @AnnaMccoy!  
 
Especially nowadays, many people struggle with sleep disorders, but it's definitely important to seek the right counsel and be informed to be able to deal with it. 😁

I'm excited that the Fitbit Charge is now able to monitor oxygen levels, however in the past week it hasn't had any readings. Is this a glitch with one of the updates, or is it no longer available?
Hello everyone, Firstly I  should say I do understand my fitbit is not a medical device. 🙂 I have spoken with my doctor and I have been referred to a sleep specialist.  My appointment is in 2 and a half more months, heh. If I don't fall asleep at the wheel first. 😕 Most of my sleep data seems very....strange. I will include some recent screen shots. My doc wonders if I have sleep apnea, but the spO2 log has never shown any high variations. In the last week or so, my allergies have been horrible, and I've gotten one speck of high variation at night. I also have never experienced the other symptoms of sleep apnea (gasping) except for being tired all the time. I will also be evaluated for narcolepsy because I have hallucinations and fragmented sleep and nightmares, and some days I could happily sleep all day. But not everyday day is like that! So my symptoms seem ambiguous. Maybe there's nothing wrong with me at all except for anxiety.  So I'm wondering...looking at these sleep charts...do you think my fitbit is functioning correctly???? Should I discount this information or show it to my specialist?

OMG!!!*cries* I am so relieved to see this post and your screenshots!!!  I have literally being dealing with the EXACT same thing... my RHR spikes during deep sleep, which happens mostly at the very beginning of my time asleep. After that, it's a struggle to get that RHR below "resting". My RHR is now up to 70 (my usual is the low to mid 60's) and has never been this high for this long. It seems like my HR fluctuates a lot during sleep and I always score poorly on the "restoration" portion of my sleep score because of this. It's not until the weekend--or vacation--when I see my RHR go below resting during sleep. I am so relieved to see I am not the only user with this experience. I have started getting back on track with the Relax guided breathing app on the Fitbit and the meditations before bed... I hope that paired with changing a few things about my bedroom environment and adding more cardio to my routine I can lower my RHR and get more restorative sleep. I found this article today, and it also gave some insightful info: https://ouraring.com/blog/heart-rate-during-sleep/ It's not a Fitbit product or article, but it was really insightful as to why I might not be getting that "ideal hammock shape" *insert eye roll*

No sleep scores for me the last 2 nights either.  Was there some kind of update?
Is it possible to set up your sleep goals so that it only tells you you've reached your goal is you get BETWEEN two lengths of time? I have depression and some nights I don't sleep enough and other times I spend too much time sleeping. I would like to be able to set my sleep goals in a way that doesn't blindly reward me for sleeping for 10 hours because it's over my goal of 7.5.
@Mons_mons.. that really can't be compared. everyone is different and what maybe normal for one isn't for another. it could also vary from night to night. The best measurement and comparison is to base it on how you feel and how much energy you have during the day

Hi @miguelans  due to the various laws, in the US, the age to have your own account is 13 and in some European countries, the age is 16. The Versa is made for an adult, or at least someone old enough to have their own account. You could go with a Inspire HR, but the age would have to be older than 13 and yes, it wouldn't be quite right for a five year old. These devices use the age, height and gender to determine things, such as stride. Was there a medical reason you wished to monitor him?

Hi, For the comparison to be accurate, I would like to see what your results are with the dominant arm and a normal setting.  You have indicated that you changed the setting to sensitive when you changed arms.  There is a huge difference in how motion is logged between normal and sensitive. Try returning the device to normal on the dominant arm and check your results.
I know the fitbit isn't a "medical device" but my heartrate went up 5 bpm during a cold and secondary broncial infection I'm just recovering from. Even though I had my energy returned after the initial cold, my fitbit was telling me I wasn't over it yet. I could tell too. I had a continual slightly runny nose which during my seconary infection turned into a horrid cough that would just not stop...no fever with that like the initial cold. My fitbit is showing I'm now recoverd if I go by my heart rate getting back down to normal. I'd probably recovered faster had I gone to the doctor to get some antibiodics like others at work had done. Anyway I survived.

Hi,I would like to check my son’s sleep and I’m wondering what is the best watch to do it. I bought the Ace 2 but itlooks a bit limited and does not monitor heart rate. The sleep report is also limited compared to the one I get with my Versa. Can a Versa be used in a child to monitor his sleep? Is the algorithm also suitable for a 5 year old?Thanks.
Thank you so much for your reply... I didn’t think it would be that easy!KateSent from my iPad
Scoring has appeared on my app, but with no actual score recorded for any night.
I don't know if this discussion group gets changes made but it's a start. When I first got my fitbit it showed me the total hours of sleep.  Recently that has been changed and now if I wake up in the middle of the night I have multiple entries in the log.  On the dashboard it will show me the total number of hours, but the log breaks it up into segments.  That means when I look back I have to add up the hours.  It would really be great if we could see total hours in the logfiles. Charles
I usually take about 400-500 mg of magnesium oxide right before bedtime.  But no one has ever accused me of being neurotypical, so your results may vary. If you take too little, nothing noticeable happens.  If you take too much, you get the runs.  So it's easy to just back off the dosage if you notice that.  At that dosage for me, it means I have an easy poop in the morning, but not anything negative.  But you might have to play around with it to see what works for you. Also, people have found that different types of magnesium work differently for them.  Most common is magnesium oxide, and many people say it doesn't work as well for them.  Magnesium citrate is the preferred choice for people who notice a difference, and it's supposed to absorb better than oxide.  Personally, magnesium oxide (the cheap stuff) works best for me, but again - I'm weird.

Update: For the last 5 days the sleep score has been showing. I changed the way I use the app. Instead of using the app and selecting 'begin sleep', I just go to sleep while wearing the fitbit as usual and dont start anything on the app. The next morning the fitbit app automatically figures out that I've been sleeping and gives me a nice score for it. Gnite!

Thanks for you response, but the target is fulfilled just before midnight, not on the following day. And I don't want to change my daily target to other than calories. The calory amount is my main motivation to exercise.
@JackP When you need to analyse your HR to a finer level you can create a Custom Activity, for example, in your case call it Surge HR.  That is if you haven't already set your workout on the Surge to record your sleeping activity. For those reading this, my Charge HR's will not record very low level timer activity from the button so you need to create the Custom Activity if you need the one minute HR graphs for sleeping analysis. I use the mobile phone to create the HR graph because it uses the exact calories over the time period you select. If you do it on the Dashboard of the PC it is a bit, hit and miss with the calories. When you create the Custom Activity it flattens the calories over the elapsed time so if you are keen on active minutes and you have selected, say your waking hours it will affect those. So I recommend you delete the Activity created after you analyse it. Here is an example of  a recent sleep period.where we had a balmy Spring night in Melbourne and I was restless with the warmth, but no humidity.  I kept waking up and tossing around.  We have had record above average temperatures this October.  This was created after the sleep period using the Custom Activity. Nice to have another engineer in the posts, by nature I like my baselines as well..   @JackP wrote:I also noticed the Fitbit Surge is useful during sleep to know when something is going on.  I had a bad episode of heartburn one night that woke me up. (I take Nexium and I forgot it).  My heart rate spiked and sustained for almost an hour AND the other thing that tells me something is wrong when I sleep is the active minutes measured by calories burned.  While I can't find the detailed heart rate data like I have in the app, I do have the calories burned in the log. This morning I felt tired when I woke up like I didn't sleep well.  I got a normal amount of sleep for me but when I looked at the "active minutes" I had 26 minutes within an hour of getting up and looking further it was at 1:30ish in the morning when I was fast asleep! Or so I thought. Makes me wonder what happened. No heart burn this time. The Fitbit is great for insight like this. I look at data all the time (engineer) and I am formerly a paramedic, so I am figuring out new things to use it for frequently.  This is almost like having a medical grade heart monitor on all the time. Things I never knew about are coming to light now.

Please post your sleep graphs if you have any apnea.  I have mild apnea and I am curious to see if our graphs look similar.   I use an oral appliance to treat it.  I can't use CPAP.  Tried, but couldn't take to it.  Thanks!

There's a big difference between deep sleep and passing out from drinking. Alcohol can inhibit the release of hormones during deep sleep.

I had the same problem with my husband. He snores terribly and tosses around like a fish flopping in the sun. He has a c-pap machine but he only wears it for about 4 hours a night. Once I’m up, I just can’t go back to sleep. So here’s what I did, and it’s one of those things that people get weird about, but it works for us. We’ve been married for 27 years and happier than ever. Especially since I started sleeping in the guest room. Yes, we now sleep in separate beds. It’s done wonders. I didn’t realize how stressed I was  just anticipating how bad the night was going to be. I go to bed early, read, have soft music playing and just wind down in my own space. It’s really helped a lot and it’s something I carve out for myself and for my health. Oh, and by the way, now my husband doesn’t stress about waking me up! I didn’t realize he even gave it a second thought, but he’s also much more relaxed and sleeping better. I hope this helps!
I got simplified sleep last night - is there a Fitbit problem?

Folks at this time I really am not real prepared to say a lot about my medical situation but it does have to do with peoper sleep and sleep studies. Please if you have a sleep study and get a cpap, bipap or even a Vpap sleep anea machine and after 90 days yes you know you are sleeping more sound yet you still have most of the sleep related issues such as daytime sleepiness, fatigue and some other things please call your sleep study doctor let them know and ask for more testing. Sleep deprivation is terrible but on the other hand over sleeping is as bad if not worse in so many ways. Due to the fact I did not realize this I am not fighting a uphill battle but an up mountain battle to get some if not most of my health issues back to my control and not sleep disorder control. Have a great and loving sleep just don't do it all the time.

New personal high.
If you go to the sleep menu and press the "+" then "BEGIN SLEEP NOW", that will let your app know when your sleeping and when you're just resting. Then in the morning you press "I'm AWAKE", and your sleep score will be correct. Plus, you CAN edit your Sleep times the next day be using the "EDIT" button. I  have a similar problem and I actually adjusted it the following day to reflect the correct sleep time, I used the "edit" button, enter the correct times and refresh...My sleep score DID adjust accordingly. Try it out, it should work!  Hope this helps, Good  Luck! 💪🌴😎

How long was your nap? I'm reading it needs to be at least one hour.
Hi everyone,My Fitbit Versa only tracks one sleep per day. I fell asleep for a short period which it recorded without the sleep stages as it's under 3 hours,  but I fell back to sleep for over 3 hours but it seems to only keep a record of the first sleep I have each day. Does anyone know if it can track multiple sleeps per day? If so, is it a setting I need to change?Thanks

What kind of device do you have? I have a Flex and had a similiar issue a few days in a row, I unsynced it with my phone and once it reconnected it straightened itself out. Give that a shot maybe? Good luck!
I usually get a lot of REM sleep but if I take a sleeping tablet, the amount of REM sleep dramatically drops and light sleep takes up about 80-90% of the night. Does anyone else notice this? Is there a reason why?
Has anyone used a mouth appliance to help with sleep apnea? I have been hesitant to do so b.c. Of TMJ; however the CPAP has not worked well for me.

Sorry I have the Charge 2
I totally agree.  If the intent is to help us track and improve our sleep, it seems reasonable to expect the Fitbit to respect our sleep schedule.  I don't necessarily want to block all notifications and I'm not as concerned about my Versa 2 vibrating, but I find it incredibly upsetting to have my phone vibrate with notifications from Fitbit while I'm trying to sleep.  Last night I got a notification around midnight that I was close to my step goal.  More frequently, I'll get a buzz about the battery level while I'm asleep...  Just wait and tell me to charge AFTER I wake up, don't tell me I'm at 25% in the middle of the night...  It seems that the app should know my target bedtime and wakeup time and hold any Fitbit notifications until after I'm up.
Reinstallation should help you.
Same problem here - privacy settings set to share sleep data for both me and GF. But we can't access eachothers sleep data. Annoying.
Does the charge 3 now have smart wake?  I am trying to decide between the charge 3 and the versa 2.  All of the other features I want are on both.  The deciding factor is the smart wake alarm.  I tried to ask customer service but they were no help.
Just to address the second part of your question.  The 12hr and 24hr is a clock preferance.  12hr is Standard.  ie 10am, 11am, 12pm, 1pm.. The 24hr is Milatary time ie.  1100 hrs, 1200 hrs, 1300 hrs, 1400 hrs... For example if you had 24hr selected, and went to bed at (9:30 pm) then woke at (6:15 am) you would enter that time in the 24hr setting as: Entered bed at 21:30 woke at 06:15.
Here's what my Apr 2 heart rate graph looked like at the time:Screenshot from Apr 2 This is what it looked like starting today:Screenshot just now This has happened to all of the dates that I've looked at frequently over the last few weeks. The reason that I've been looking at them is that they have interesting and significant data on them (this one was 8:57pm-5am my sleep-lab study, and then 6am-9:01am I have my CPAP data from when I came home and went back to sleep after the study.) Anyone else have these problems?
I have noticed a substantial lack of restless sleep! Lots of rolling around and a max of 5hrs since i got my Fitbit 3 months ago. I have attached a screenshot for some examples. Any tips/cures/diagnostics/?
Thank you for your answer. Yes, I have Fitbit Premium. The sleep stages, or the graph that is shown in Fitbit when you click "Deep and REM" as you posted above, IS a hypnogram by definition. So, I was curious how to read how many cycles you go through a night. What constitutes ONE cycle? Is it your wake times into deep? Or wake to wake? Or deep to deep? Seems this may not have been where to go for an answer but I thank you for giving it a shot!
Calling all Fitbit users! Has Fitbit helped you sleep better? If you have a slumber story to tell, let us know!
I see the benchmark sleep function on my iPhone app; are you asking for it to show on our dashboard when we look at it on the webpage? I have been trying to find it that way, and do not see it. I would like to see it on my computer for a larger screen, as you stated. I also would like to see additional benchmark data that does not show on the app: X awake and hours slept.
Do you have a Charge 2? For the Charge 2 they are still rolling the update out to everyone (I am waiting too).

Hi everyone im new here how do u set up sleep and recored it and when i awake i can veiw it in morning thanks
@Ari5211  Correlation is not causation. What you observe does not mean the vaccine is directly responsible for it. There are much more plausible explanation, the more plausible one being that as the vaccine triggers an immune response (it is its job), your body was busy doing this during the night, building up an immune response and an inflammatory response, which :- takes energy (increase in heart rate)- increases body temperature- decrease the Heart Rate Variability.All those are normal and expected responses, a good sign your body is responding as it should to the vaccine.But in turn, your body was under stress and a stressed body sleeps badly, usually. You probably turn around more, had more shallow breathing and this resulted in more SPO2 variations.  @Daloures I would be happy to answer any questions you had about the vaccine.
How can I remove oxygen levels when sleeping as now app has been updated it has turned all my previous sleeps yellow where they were OK before. I don't want this anymore only sleep time
I can't say it's a direct correlation, however, when I'm not sleeping well my energy levels can be lower.  Because of work commitments my sleep has been lower the last couple of weeks.  I can usually get up early and workout without any trouble.  However, this week It's been a disaster - getting over 8 hours on Saturday night (high for me), then just over 5 hrs on Sunday, not even 3 hrs on Monday - and I didn't get my tracker synced this morning before I left home.  However, I couldn't drag myself out of bed to do any kind of workout, so now I'll have to do it tonight. Some people run very well on lower sleep.  In fact I'm pretty sure I did when I was 20 or maybe even 30 years younger.

I would definitely say yes, it has improved my sleep. I have been told I snore recently and I didn't until the last couple of years. After seeing how much restorative sleep I was losing and knowing I was mouth breathing (!), I decided to use some sleep aids to keep my nostrils open and voila! My sleep has improved, I feel more rested and have more energy. Just knowing I was suddenly snoring apparently wasn't enough for me. I needed the sleep section on my Fitbit to show me. I also will be trying new devices for my nasal passages as the ones I originally purchased have all disappeared thanks to my cat.
After a week, I'm averaging 67% sleep efficiency. I am in bed for 8-9 hours and asleep 5.5

I don't think this is specifically a Charge 5 issue. I had this happen on my Verse 2 -- I get up to let the dogs out at 4:30-5 am.  I'm up about 15 minutes and then go back to bed until 6:30.   Most days it stops recording my sleep when I get up during the dog hour.    If I try to manually modify the sleep time later,  it will show the total hours actually slept on the dashboard,  but I don't get full details on the tab -- it just records until the dog hour and then nothing after.   Very rarely will it display the full details of my night.
I have the problem that i wake up naturally without a alarm clock and i am since 9 months every day  tired in the morning. The tiredness gone et the erliest after 1 hour.  I have nothing found in the blood test expect vitamin a  lack. I am taking enoght vitamin a, d, and zink.My morning cortisol is very good.  I sleep enough (7-8) hours. I have the suspicion that the problem is the railway track. I live here almost 2  years. When i sleep (with open window) 40 trains drive.  I have bought the fitbit charge 2 and have make my first sleep tracking. But Fitbit had nothing found...12.1% awake 15,5% REM 58% Light 14,4% Deep  What your meaning? Do you have the same Problem in the morning? What i can improve?
that is really strange. mine records that I am awake, but once I fall back to sleep it shows that I am asleep. The graph may give you a break in the pattern, but it should give you a total number of hours asleep as well as awake and restless through out the night. If you post a picture of what you see, maybe others can chime in with thoughts and opinions...

I have the exact same thing happening to me. Almost every night my heart stays above my resting heart rate. I’ve tried taking nine of my beds before bed, no alcohol… all I can think of is my anxiety, too. Which is pretty bad. My fight or flight kicks in pretty quick but why is it staying like this ALL night, right??

I take it this means I don’t experience particular breathing problems during sleep.

Sleep blocks getting split up and not recording accurately.  How can I edit to combine to get accurate data?
I got my fitbit hr two years ago and started having vivid crazy dreams and nightmares every time I wore the fitbit to bed. I then stopped wearing it and the dreams stopped. I recently found it and thought I would give it another go and wore it for the first time last night. The dreams returned hence googling to see if there are other reports on this and found your post I certainly believe the fitbit is responsible .
That can’t be right ..... my OLD versa 2 still has all the sleep stages. The problem is that my husband's NEW Versa 2 with Alexa only has the basic sleep tracker. Are you telling us that we have bought an inferior model? I am going to try and contact Fitbit direct to see what they say.Sent from my iPad
Please be aware that if you have narcolepsy, your tracker will not be accurate for tracking exercise, weight loss, etc. Apparently those of us with narcolepsy have lower basal metabolic rates, and the FitBit is not designed for anyone with a lower metabolism than textbook normal. Since there is no way to adjust that, you will end up like me- exercising an hour a day, eating half as much as you burn, and not losing any weight whatsoever.
Hi, @NCTom! That seems about typical with what I have, too. I think most adults tend to be in the 7-8 hour total duration, so I'm guessing you're right about on what you should be. If you feel tired, you can try adjusting it a bit and see what happens.

@Argali   As someone who has been tracking sleep since automatic tracking was introduced, I can confirm that the leading hour is included.  Sleep tracking isn't perfect.  Sometimes my sleep stages graph starts with me asleep, as if I fell asleep somewhere between standing and lying down.  Fitbit doesn't publish anything more specific than about an hour.

My RHR is also higher that it has been for extended periods of time.  Used to be right around 50-52, now suddenly it's between 54-56.  I'm beginning to lose faith in fitbit projections.  They've also screwed up sleep times.
I have the same problem as the other users and my bathroom is right next to my bedroom, practically hooked on. I have the versa lite.
I have tried both settings and it is way off. I usually go to bed around 12 and get up at 7 and usually it states I get 4-5 hrs sleep. My wife says I do not snore, but I do toss some. Is my device defective?
I was working on my computer, so absorbed that I may sit very still. So a 'deep sleep' of 1 hour was logged between 9 and 10 a.m.!  I had to manually delete it.  It never happened before. 
 
You may want to check your sleep log today. Something is wrong.

I am jealous of my husband. He gets much better sleep than me. I got him a fit bit for a early birthday gift(bday December) I got my fitbit a week ago and was so enthused about it he wanted one. So when I logged his sleep he wasn't sure what time he actually went to sleep so I guessed. He apparantly didn't go to sleep until a little later than my estimate. When he actually went to sleep no restlessness or awake periods until we woke up. Me on the other hand  I was restess 15 times and awake 7. Over a 9hour period. Not fair lol.
I've owned a Fitbit ONE for YEARS, until getting a Surge in December.  I think the Surge's sleep tracking is HORRIDLY inaccurate. I live in chronic pain and some nights don't sleep at all-- but, toss, turn, moan, and groan instead. I couldn't wait see if the Surge was a more accurate tracker given its price tag. Sadly, I wanted to use it to show my doctors. NOPE. I am hooking up my old Fitbit for sleep, as it is far better at telling the truth.

I just noticed this recently as well. Looks like it has been going on for about 3 years or so. I guess it was never fixed, just glad I am not the only one experiencing this spike at around 1:00 am on an almost daily basis.

Hi @claire1390 Welcome to the forums. I've seen that happen a time or two. Easy way to fix it after the fact is to delete the auto entry and manually add the start and stop times for your sleep and Fitbit will populate the data for the entire time. I'm not sure why this happens, but I hope this tip helps.

Which tracker do you have, @FaithyAnn In case of having a Fitbit Surge then it's possible at night to turn off the back light setting on the tracker itself. Happy Sleeping @GisselleM #all
Good one... thanks for the laugh... perhaps if I hung out with Dave more I wouldn't be concerned about not getting enough sleep.  Kidding - I'm perfectly happy with my 5-6 hours per night. - just confused about the "new math" - especially since it seems that I'm the only one who has noticed it. Have a good one!G
I have been going to bed earlier so that I can get at least 6 hours of sleep  - I will be going to bed at 10:00 p.m. tonight and then I will be up walking the treadmill with my group in the morning at 5:00 a.m. - I have trained myself to do this - in fact - have a nice night 🙂@Orlando wrote:Setting a daily goal like for steps/floors etc. really motivates me to reach it, I can't find a way to do that for sleep hours, am I missing something?

I am a night person and sometimes when I am watching movies late at night around 10pm or even 1am my fitbit if I am sitting still not moving thinks I am asleep, one time I went to watch a movie at the theater and it thought I was asleep for 2 hours during the movie lol, I always gotta go home and delete those sleep logs, its annoying.
Did you try with restarting your Fitbit? Try Syncing every time manually.By the way, you can try with some other Fitbit Sleep trackers that perfectly work for sleep tracking.if you need suggestions on Fitbit sleep monitoring devices then go through this article once. It has been written about all the best Fitbit sleep trackers also with a comparison with other sleep trackers.
thats becasue you are sus
I got my FitBit HR at Christmas and it did not automatically track my sleep. I have to manually start my sleep tracking( click the + button when in the sleep portion of the app. It says Sleep Now)  and then when I wake in the morning. It gives me all the data in the morning. I would prefer it to do it automatically bu but it doesn't happen.
I haven't been able to track my sleep since 14th February.  How can I fix this?
Just got the device.  I woke up at 3 for a pee and it did not record the rest of the night.  I am unclear why this is marked as solved.   How do we actually solve this problem everyone is having?   Thanks.
@Timtimtimtim  I would recommend you to not buy any Fitbit if you want to monitor your sleep patterns with some degrees of accuracy. None of the Fitbit are particularly accurate for this and you also need to buy a Premium membership to see sleep pattern details. If it is the one feature that matters, then buy a dedicated sleep tracker device that does only that. The Oura ring seems to be getting constant good reviews for this.https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-sleep-trackers

@Aliciao1 wrote:Does the sleep tracking technology differ between the fitbit versions that offer sleep stages? For example, is the Charge 3's technology somehow more advanced or better than that of the Alta HR or Inspire HR? Thanks!Hi @Aliciao1,As far as I know, all the HR-enabled fitbits use the same PurePulse technology. It makes sense they would track the same, so that results are consistent when we switch to another fitbit.People may have different opinions based on their experience (that Versa is better than Alta HR or vice versa). But between the Charge 2, Alta HR, Charge 3, Ionic and Versa--I've noticed no real difference.

It was released on a trial basis to a small % of users, hopefully to be released to everyone but no schedule as yet.  There is nothing you can do to get it or get it back, just wait.  And know that what you did get, you were one a fortunate few.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Hey, all you restless sleepers out there in the Land of Fitbit! Are you getting a flash in the eyeball from those green dots (Charge HR measuring heartbeat), or the wrist motion-generated time? So, make Fitbit a nightie! It's fun and easy. Here's a sock that had a hole: I cut out the toe and heel, leaving a tube 4-5 inches long for comfort. Here's the result:Can't resist showing off Mme. Butterfly (see her lip?) ... yes, that's my girl ... yes, that's my girl ... I tried using the ankle part of the sock also. You can experiment and see what works best for you.The cuff is nice, but I preferred the foot part because it was roomier. This is a great way to recycle old socks. No need to hem, and if it frays, make it into a dustcloth. There's always another sock you can use to cut a fresh nightie. No more light leaks! I hope this is helpful. Now, get a good night's sleep, so you can get your 10K steps tomorrow. And if you like my hack, please vote me up.  🙂Louise
Yes mine this morning said I didn't get to sleep until 2am resulting in and awake at 6:20. I know I was asleep before 2 because at midnight I woke up to go to the bathroom came back and immediately fell asleep and didn't wake up until 7am.
OK, inside the app, under the sleep section, should looks something like below. Next to 30 Day Avg is Benchmark. | More details can be found here.

Can you give me more information?
I had a charge 3 that worked till display stopped.  Had it replaced with charge4.   Total lemon.   Am getting run around from customer service.  This is the only function I wanted the watch got and it doesn’t work.   Suggestions?
How go you switch the sensitivity tracker in your Charge 2?
Just to be clear this is when you are trying to view your recorded sleep? Try going to www.fitbit.com through a web browser. You should be able to see full sleep record there. The display on the phone is limited.On your phone where the sleep record is displayed on dashboard hit the arrow, it should take you to next screen, previous nights sleep. From there you can press further arrow to see full sleep record,
Mine seems to record from the time i set it to sleep mode to the time I turn it off as asleep. Which is not correct, it does list time awake/restless but it seems to be included in the time asleep. I get up several times a night, but it shows as sleeping. Not an accurate recording now, I much prefer the old method of recording used. Perhaps it is a programme error that they are working on to rectify - I hope so!
Iphone 4S and up are really what work with the Flex from what I understand.  Just wondering what all I can do that I don't know yet.  My sleep just started to NOT track properly.  It was fine.  I'm a newbie too. Thanks,Mary

Hi everyone, I'm wondering if you guys have any insight at all. I have been having nightmares regularly for over 10 years. The nightmares have been progressing to bad dreams since I've been on medication. My doctor even had me checked for sleep apnea by sending me home with a pulse oximeter to use during sleep: I don't have sleep apnea. I am also on a second medication that helps with my nightmares and my nightmares aren't as bad anymore. If my dreams are bad, they are usually just bad dreams and not in the nightmare territory and most of the time they are just vivid dreams. However, I wake up exhausted every morning and since I started wearing my Flex 2 to sleep since I got it in February, my sleep stats are showing 200-300 minutes of restlessness a night. I don't have trouble falling asleep at all--usually when my head hits the pillow, I'm asleep quite quickly. I do nap for 1-2 hours on occasion. Does anyone have any tips or insight? I'm desperate for some good sleep! Thanks!
Here's a page I put together on the subject of getting better sleep:https://www.thusness.com/sleep.html
This is a screenshot from last night. The screenshot from the previous night is from my Fitbit app on my iPhone that is kept up to date. Last night was unusual for the amount of time I was in bed but this is typical for restless sleep for me. And this is what I want to know if it’s accurate on. Can it actually track the sleep stages or am I wasting my time even reading into my Fitbit.
I agree, not professional at all. I let it slide that once though bc he is my fav doc and always upbeat and funny. I will keep all my logs and bring them in during my next appointment to see how they stack up vs thir sleep study.
This features seems very hit and miss. Sometimes it works great, and highlights the amount of time spend in each stage, 30 day average and bench mark; and does so for a few days, but then out of the blue, it decides to revert back to the old way. I don't do anything different, that I am aware of, it just wants to be very hit and miss.
Once, I got TOO tired to fall asleep!I simply couldn’t get enough sleep. I’d gotten into a cycle of being too tired to fall asleep!I got myself out of it by taking lots of time to fall asleep. A good read works best for me. But no liquids at night due to incontinence problems.Best of luck with your sleep!
I also have RLS. What I find helps, and it very well could be a placebo effect, is 8 ounces of tonic water (with quinine) around 5pm. To help with the taste, I put in a shot of Mio lemonaide flavoring and just drink it down. It's not too bad and it seems to be alievating some of the worst of it. At least, I'm not up pacing a couple of times during the night. I had read about this somewhere and thought it would be worth a shot. Some nights are better than others, but overall, it seems to be working for me.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZMA_(supplement)  Works for me.
Hiya, Interestingly I've just done a quick calcultion using your percentages of my recent 65 mins deep sleep = 11%65 ÷11 × 23 is roughly 2hrs 25 mins which fits the 2hrs 30 mins I originally mentioned.Regards Madeleine
Hi, @MarkF48 , it is good that you are seeing your physician and discussing this with them, as only they know your fill details.  Over the internet you will only get a general idea... So, having said that, generally speaking a low heart rate is a good thing.  It means your heart is doing less work.  Less work means it will last longer...  A low heartrate while sleeping also suggests deep relaxation: another good thing!  So there is much more reason to be happy than to be worried... However, you should also remember that Fitbits, while they can help give you a lot of insight into your general health, your activity levels, and your sleep, they are not medical devices.  It’s best to look at general trends rather than individual, one off readings.

My sleep did not register last night for the first time ever. I've restarted, manually synced, and nothing is showing for last night. Seeing a sleep doc in a couple of weeks, and really need this info. Has anyone found that theirs started logging sleep again? Thanks!
Can anyone tell me where the graphs went that show each night what your sleep pattern broken down by percent %? Such as awake, restless, rem, and deep? Frustrated.   Thanks
Looks like FitBit is investigating the issue, It happened on mine as well.
Thank you I will try it out and other oils😊
I recently got a Sleepace RestOn from IndieGoGo, which uses a strap under the bedsheet to monitor your sleep. It monitors movement, breathing, heartrate etc. These are the results from last night:  You can see comparing the Fitbit graph with the one from the Sleepace app, that the Deep and Mid sleep are roughly in line with the gaps in the Fitbit readings (ie. when I was asleep). So most of my movement appears to happen during the light sleep periods. I know its not exactly scientific, but I thought it was interesting to see the correlation at least. PS. Sorry for the funny colours in the screengrabs, thats from the Twilight app on my phone!
I've been a narcoleptic with hypnogogic sleep, collapse when I get emotional since I was a kid. Back then, I was considered lazy.About 20 years ago I found out I actually was bipolar as well.I think society has gotten beyond the lazy label, but I believe it's unrealistic to expect any device to simulate a sleep study which involves all the electrodes to monitor your sleep. We are not like most people and products are designed for the rest of the population.The bright side is, having my fidbit does record my steps and as I endeavor to get in better shape; it gives me a rough idea how my resting heart beat is affected.Finally, I don't think fidbit will begin measuring sleep cycles until you have slept for more than 4? Hours which of course, doesn't work for a narcoleptic who can literally sleep at anytime. Nsrcolepsy is not that common and narcolepsy with cataplexy is even rarer. Add bipolar disorder to that, well for me, I think I might as well be from another planet.smile.Living with a disability where it's not self evident, like you're blind or your a free bleeder and people can see blood isn't an easy hurdle to negotiate but it can never become an excuse. When I was a kid I was lazy, now I am old and have Provigil and Xyrem. I already kniw I am narcoleptic. Who cares if my Fidbit don't?
I'm sorry you have so much trouble with your sleep. All of my clients have had great success blacking out their bedroom. I do mean completely dark. No electronics at all, no electric alarm clocks. Just battery operated. The supplements I recommend work great from time to time. One more thing to add is hot bath with Epsom salt. The magnesium will relax your body. Good luck

My sleep app at times is tracking me as sleeping when I'm actually up and about. This last time it recorded that I slept from 1:29 PM - 5:30 AM 8 hr 35 min. Under sleep quality is says 6 hr 27 min to fall asleelp, 47 times awake, 57 times restless, 7 hr 26 min awake/restless. There is definitely something wrong with this, since I was at work until 5:00 PM and then drove home 30 miles, about an hours drive. Definitely something wrong with the sleep app. I was hoping to track my sleep to see if I could figure out a pattern between sleeping (or lack of) and migraines, but I give up, it's giving me a migraine!
If you want to see previous sleep log in Normal or Sensitive -  Go to the Log, and the Sleep page. If you hover the mouse over the sleep record, and Edit option with appear. Select it, and in the lower left of the edit view that appears there is an option to change to Normal or Sensitive depending on what it is already in. Click on that and it will update your sleep record to show it in the selected sensitivity.  Not sure if it is possible to do more than one at a time unfortunately.

To help you get to sleep faster, have a bedtime routine that tells your body, time to sleep. Most nights I take a melatonin tab before my nightly shower. (I don't take it on weekends, though.) I also dab on some aromatherapy stuff while I'm getting into bed. I admit to reading in bed because sometimes it does help me sleep. But I try to read a physical book instead of something on my e-reader. I have breathing exercises I've modified from a Pilates class where I inhale through the nose and when I exhale, sinking my belly as low as I can. I do that ten times, sometimes more. I have a book called Yoga in Bed for "asanas you can do in your pajamas" that I sometimes use--I might do a modified goddess pose or a few gentle twists. I sleep naked except on the coldest of nights. I hear it's better for you.
For reference last night I had 7hr 12 min sleep with 36 mins awake (47/50)1hr 12 min deep, 2hr 4 min REM (21/25)and a restoration score of 13/25 RHR 51/ SHR 55 above 94% of the time.sleep score 81Here’s my dilemma, Fitbit says because my SHR was above my RHR for so long during night that that’s a “sign of disrupted” sleep. However, you can see by the other data that clearly I slept well throughout the majority of the night with little interruption. I was not tossing and turning or wide awake unable to sleep causing my heart rate to increase.I believe that FitBit needs to account for the differences that cause heart rate to increase during the night due to controlled  vs uncontrollable circumstances. They cannot praise getting great deep sleep and REM and then punish my restoration score because my heart rate went up during that time…something I can’t control. Whereas heart rate being elevated while restless, and awake or anxious or in light sleep is something I can control…deep breathing, muscle relaxation, meditation etc.Is there any explanation for something like this? I often wake up feeling like I got a good night’s sleep, well rested and then am very disappointed to see a lower than expected sleep score. I wear my Fitbit on my non-dominant hand, snug but not too tight just above my wrist bone. Should I move it higher, wear it loser or tighter? It is Set to normal not sensitive.  Would love to hear any feedback on this!
How often do you sleep? My kids just recently told me they have found me sleep walking. I need to look into my insurance to see if a sleep study is covered.

I created a simple and fast fix for the incorrect "time to fall asleep" problem. You don't have to edit your sleep manually anymore! 😉 Here's the link for the post I made previously on Charge HR help forum: CLICK HERE
Same thing just started happening to my sleep times about a week ago. My sleep time is split in 2 and there is like an hour gap in between the two times. They must have broken the sleep software recently. Pretty frustrating but I'll try your hack.
@SunsetRunner Thanks for adding those screenshots! That does sound strange. Is this happening every night? It sounds like a glitch for that day. If it happens again please report this to our Support Team at http://contact.fitbit.com and let them know specifically what happened. They would need to take a look at your device's history.

Have any of you tried supplementing magnesium before bed? I do epsom salts baths and use magnesium oil spray on my skin after the baths, also taking a dose of ZMA (magnesium & B vits) on nights when I really need sleep.  Seems to help me a lot.

Hey @AZLemur , congratulations on getting zero ahi. That's huge. Isn't it amazing when you get a good nights sleep using the cpap? I felt so good when I got my cpap dialed in and was getting ahi's of 2 and below with some 0 event nights. I knew I was dragging during the day and for me headaches but had no idea how much better I could feel. I have to remember my Fitbit device is not a medical device and a cpap machine is, so I don't put much stock in my Fitbit over my cpap. ( but I still want to get a good score, lol.) I found my Fitbit is a great motivational tool for me and if I'm heading in the right direction re active minutes, steps etc. Take care.
Several magazines suggest that the Alta HR is the best best choice forsleeptracking while Charge 2 was already available in shops. This is whatcaused, I guess, me and other people to start doubting maybe there is adifference in sensors and software. It is not that there is written thereIS a difference. My apologies if I was unclear about this
I found a useful post on this topic, if anybody else is wondering about this:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-christopher-winter/sleep-tips_b_4792760.html This was a self-test conducted by a sleep specialist.  He wore 5 different sleep trackers (including Fitbit Flex) during a polysomnogram and compared the results.  Very interesting.
Poor Sleeper In Need of any advice I can get - I have a full schedule working full time as well as school. But it doesn't seem to matter how tired at the end of the day I still can't sleep!!! - I average about 3 - 3.5 hrs a night. I have not had any success with medication sleep aids and am wanting to know If anyone can give me some ideas I haven't tried yet as it is starting to affect my health. Part of this is due to chronic nightmares so please no suggestions that have vivid dreams as a side effect.
For all of my sleep graphs, awake instances show up as being a minimum of 30 seconds. Since that's how mine have always shown up, I was assuming that's the minimum time increment that it picks up an awakening as.  What I'm saying is that (to my knowledge) the scientific study cited by Fitbit is based on awakenings being well under 30 seconds, but yet Fitbit counts awakenings being 30 seconds or greater. So while the study suggests that 20-25 awakenings of (for example) 20 seconds each may be normal, what the study does not suggest is how many awakenings of 30+ seconds (as Fitbit counts it) is actually normal. I would be curious to see what the norm for awakenings of at least 30 seconds is, although from some charts I've seen it seems like it is very few.
I've contacted fitbit about this.  Very disappointed when it disappeard.  Fitbit was not very responsive and basically said.  "tough **ahem**.  Live with it."
Hi, this is exactly what one can find in the official description of smart wake, so my question goes a bit further than what's revealed there. I'd like to know, if smart wake awakes me before or after REM or anytime I'm briefly waking up on my own.
I stopped using my fitbit he two years ago due to vivid dreams and nightmares.  I recently thought I would give it another go and they have started again .
Hi, so which one would you recommend for a more accurate setting then, sensitive or normal? Thanks so much!
This is the issue, I'm already doing all that lol.  I use the blue light filter on the computer and phone.  No naps during the day etc.  As for working out, I lift weights after work 5 days per week, I work in manual labour so am on my feet 90% of the day clocking up over 15k steps at work alone.  So I am very active.  I fall into bed knackered and am sleeping usually within 15 mins and that takes us back to where I am at now.   In bed 8.30pm I'll wake usually around 11, 1 and then usually every hour after 1am, from 1 am on its very light sleep like I am hardly sleeping at all. the best sleep is from 8.30 - 11pm
Due to my difficulty to fall a sleep, I always monitor my sleep with Fitbit Charge 2.Last night a strange result appeared on my Charge 2.I slept at 20:34 and woke up at 05:00 so I slept supposedly for 3:26 hrs + 5 hrs = 8:26 hrs.But Charge 2 calculated as 6:54 hrs where are the ± 2 hrs gone?Help me to correct those error. Thank you.

Your Fitbit did the first thing for you -- that is, it identified a poor sleep pattern. Improving it can come from lifestyle changes.  Good places to look for lifestyle tips come from the National Sleep Foundation, WebMD, and the Mayo Clinic.  Google "how to get better sleep" and you will find a lot of choices.  Make some lifestyle changes and see if your sleep improves. Our love for our electronics is thought to be a current problem.  The activity of playing games and sending messages is thought to keep our brain too active, making it hard to fall asleep.  Also, the light is thought to decrease melatonin, our natural sleep hormone.  Give lifestyle changes a chance to work.  If lifestyle changes don't work, then you might want to talk to your doctor about a formal sleep study to help you.

In this case, @shipo's tip to work on sleep efficiency and adapting your environment to help you get a good night's sleep. Leave your sleep settings on sensitive; IMHO it's giving you more things to take into consideration rather than the normal setting which shows as "too normal".

@chris_in_cal True he only did it for a few nights but he gives all the devices the same or similar amount of time.  Plus you can see that Fitbit devices in general do well. I've been tracking every night since the end of December and it's been very accurate for my start and end times. No more than 10 minutes off from what I eyeballed before going to bed and after waking up.

All of the times waking up. My girlfriends looks nothing like that. She might have 1 wakeup spike a night.
I'm 56 and getting back into running to lose weight, but I've struggled with getting a solid night's sleep for years. I'm about 15 pounds overweight. I've had a sleep study done but nothing significant was diagnosed.  I wake up multiple times during the night and no OTC drugs help.   I've tried Lunesta; melatonin; herbal teas; etc. etc. and nothing gives me a solid night's sleep.  Even sleeping on the most luxurious mattresses won't help.   However, I wake up on time and don't doze off at work.  I wish I had the right answer, but if you've had a good physical; eat well and exercise well, it may be one of those things you have to cope with.
Hey, it is nice to have you here! Thanks for stopping by, @Decadence. That is cool, I have mandala coloring book! It is so relaxing to paint and draw, sometimes even just improvising with whatever is on your mind also helps a lot. 🙂

The best option is to consult a doctor. Also, a properly ventilated and sterile sleeping area also helps, my partner has sleep apnea as well.

No it's not that, when you look at the chart that shows you ho much sleep you get, and restless waking, there is an edit button, and if you click that it says normal or another option, which do people use?
@dottyrc  Making it part of your nightly routine would be the best. For me, I tap my Flex into sleep mode as I check my alarm clock and turn on the radio. You might want to start sleep mode when you finish brushing your teeth or sitting on the side of the bed. Just pick one time and stick with it. You can do it! Welcome to the forums.

I know I need to see a doctor for a definite answer but I was wondering about if my sleep chart indicates it might be the cause behind my tiredness during the day?For background I'm 26yo female, 105lbs, I recently did a premium trial and noticed I have a lot of red lines in my time asleep chart that seems like way more than compared to ones I've seen online. Is this a normal amount? Also, it seems like the sleep score is massively inaccurate though as I get 80s and wake up tired but feel energized after sleep that scores 60s
You can set wake up alarms on your tracker by day and time, not by duration. I hope I understood your question properly...

Why does my fit bit log my sleep on the wrong day. I go to bed on Monday night and sleep from 10.30pm to 7.30 am Tuesday it logs my sleep as Tuesday not Mondays.

@Mjd6159 thanks for posting on Community! To edit the time you fall asleep and wake up on your sleep log, follow these steps!
 
@frankie156 @Åsaknies you both can also follow the instructions in the link I've posted above if your tracker starts counting sleep time while you're reading or playing games on your phone in bed. Since you're lying still without much movement, your tracker probably thinks you've fallen asleep! No big deal - just edit your sleep log to choose the time you fell asleep!
 
Hope this helps!

I still don't understand how I can get a sleep score in the 80s, when my total sleep was just over 5 hours one night and then score in the mid-70s when my duration is over 7 hours.  I realize it looks at all the information, but it just seems that 5 hours would leave me less time for the stages of sleep as compared to a 7+ hour sleep.

Mine is the same, normally high [89-91] but when I go to the gym  [4-5 days a week] it quickly goes down to 83-85... need to keep going so it continues to go down because as soon as I stop it goes right back up!  My BP is always pretty good though 😁

WalkingAmanda, if you switch your device off to reset it and then switch it on again you will not loose any recorded information. Even turning you phone off and on again will not affect the recorded information. Re-syncing your devices will not loose any information that might have been recorded the previous night. I hope this answers your question in part. The information recorded on your fitbit device should only be regarded as guide and I am sure you are already aware of that. The only way to properly diagnose a sleep disorder is to undergo a 24hr sleep study.

Hey, so I've had my FitBit for a week today and I'm totally obsessed with meeting as many goals as I can on a daily basis. A problem I started experiencing yesterday is that my Flex will start to vibrate and when I look down, it's showing the flashing and fading lights that indicate that the sleeptracker is engaged. I then have to tap it to turn the sleeptracker off. It happened once yesterday evening while I was at work (walking around and being quite active actually). Today it happened three more times within an hour. I was out Christmas shopping with friends when it happened the first time and then I was making an hour-long drive home when it happened two more times. It's happened both when I was actively walking around and when I was sitting relatively still. Nothing was near my arm to tap it accidentally any of the times that the tracker was engaged. Is there some sort of trouble shooting I can do? Or perhaps adjusting the sensitivity on my Flex? Or is this something else entirely? Please help. I love my tracker and just want make sure its accurately taking data.
@JustJean @iJackieI strongly recommend you read this book, or at least listen to the author's podcasts on the subject. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sleep-Smarter-Proven-Better-Success/dp/0984574522

Well now that I am a few nights in, it seems to be working just fine—times I get up in the night are just indicated as awake times. I’m still not sure why my wake up time was so early the first night, but oh well! It’s really interesting to look at graph data.
I have both a charge hr and surge.  It appears that sleep tracking always uses the surge regardless of which is worn at night.  If i wear the surge at night I show periods of restlessness and a variable sleep efficiency percentage.  When I wear the charge hr, it shows sleep efficiency of 100 with no restlessness as though it is reading from the surge sitting on my desk. Are there any known problems with sleep tracking and multiple devices?
Yes exactly..I do yoga,meditation and pranayama before going to bed and after waking up early every day... I want to achieve 90 plus score with 4.5hrs Sleep (3 sleep cycles) and make use of remaining time for my other works..So far I dont feel tired but.. Getting little dark circles under the eyes hope that will go after few weeks as my body gets aligned to this routine..
Have you tried reducing your exposure to light, especially blue light, in the late evening? Things to try include putting up light-blocking curtains in your bedroom (blocking as much light as humanly possible), turning off any electronics in your bedroom that have a display or LED (or covering things like LEDs on chargers with duct tape), dimming the lights in your home in the evening and/or using lights that have amber-colored bulbs, not watching TV or looking at smart phones, computers or tablets without two hours before bed, or wearing amber/orange-colored glasses (which you can get cheaply on Amazon) to block the blue light from lights/screens. I've been doing these things, and they make a huge difference.
@alexthecat Nice to see you around! 
 
Thank you very much for your input, I really appreciate it! Would you mind sharing which type of high intensity workouts do you currently perform? I mean the most you like to do. 😬

Hi @Piandro - Interesting post! Let me add one more suggestion - it’s “out of the box,” but whatever works, right?  I’ve found that if I can’t turn my brain off and meditation does not work (it normally does), I turn my iPad to night mode (to reduce the blue light) and take it offline. Then, I play solitaire at breakneck speed until I cannot keep my eyes open. The speed of play is critical. It forces all other thought out.
Yes, breakdown of total score between "Time asleep" (50/100), "Deep and REM" (25/100) and "Restoration" (25/100) is premium only. I’m based in Finland and I have access to it, so it’s not like it’s a US-only feature for the time being (as has been the case for some other features that were rolled out first for US users).

I have SpO2 sleeping range of 92-95%. I purchased an oximeter (on sale for $14.99) and periodically test my daytime SpO2 score. I average 95 to 98%. For peace of mind, you may want to considered purchasing one. 😀
@YojanaFitbit  I think it makes some very good points, all points I've taken into account. The problem is mostely just staying asleep. I have a very fixed schedule of going to bed, make sure to take it easy and all that other stuff in the article. The problem just is that no matter what I do, I always wake up around 3-4AM unless I'm absolutly exhausted or if I go to bed before when I usually go to bed. Then I wake up even earlier...
Hi all, can anyone help me? I would really love to know what healthy women's heart rates typically drop to during sleep, especially if you can also share your age, body size and rough activity level.  I am 42 years old, 5'2'' slim and reasonably active although nowhere near what I was.Seven years ago I had a brain injury which left me with (among other problems) a too slow heart rate and frequent fainting, and I now have a pacemaker.  I am really happy with my lower daytime limit of 60bpm - if my natural rate falls below this the pacemaker kicks in, but my night rate is 50bpm. I am paced constantly all night at this rate and not sleeping too well.  I am considering asking for it to be adjusted to a lower rate at night, however as I never monitored my heart rate whatsoever before my accident, I have no idea what my "normal" was, and surprisingly can find no data online regarding average sleeping heart rates (as opposed to "resting" rates taken during daytime.)  If I could just get an idea of what healthy people have at lowest during sleep, this would help me decide. My consultant mostly has much older, sedentary patients and most do not have the night mode option switched on at all, they just have 60bpm day and night. Some have 50bpm at night and don't seem to complain about it, however he is happy to make reasonable adjustments to my rate so that I can be most comfortable.  Many thanks xxx
@Daves_Not_Here wrote: Here is a theory as to why you need less sleep when eating Keto: we need sleep primarily to recharge our brains and neurology (with a sedentary lifestyle, we certainly don't need to recharge our muscles).  When we sleep, 85% of our energy is consumed by our brains, and dreaming is evidence of the processing of short-term memories into long-term (outside the scope of this post).  Hi @Daves_Not_Here, Source? I'm having trouble believing 85% of energy in the body is in the brain during sleep. Certainly, there are a lot of hormones released during sleep that aren't mentally-oriented. And a lot of muscle building and breakdown happens during this time also IME.  I'm curious, what are your deep sleep patterns as reported by Fitbit? The up-and-down sleep you are describing sounds consistent with brief periods of deep sleep, which would have their own implications.

I second @Laura0719. I have a bad habit of staying up later than I should. Example: last night I got 4 hours of sleep (went to bed at 2a, woke up at 6a since I have work at 7a), I get a score of 75. However, when I actually hit or go above my 7.5 hours of sleep (goal I set for myself, and failing miserably), I only get scores between 80-85. The score is only based on AMOUNT of hours slept, and not really taking into account the hours THEMSELVES that you were asleep. To use my last night as an example, I really should have gotten a score below 70 since I went to bed super late and woke up super early. This is counterproductive to those of us who don't sleep well, whether by choice (me) or medical condition (vast majority of others).

The sleep logging for the android app, as described in the document you linked from this post (http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/Tracking-sleep-with-the-Fitbit-app-for-Android/)  doesn't work with the actual android app. I've checked to make sure there aren't any updates waiting for my app, and there aren't. But there also isn't a sleep tab in my app. Or anywhere in the menu that I could click to log sleep. Does the app differ for people who have fitbit trackers that log sleep (I have a zip)?
My mom and I both had Altas, and both of us would average around 3-4 hours of sleep per night, my husband would average 6-7. Now that we've upgraded to Alta HRs this week, I've noticed that my sleep has jumped up to 7-8 hours!  WHAT?  The first night I was so restless and nervous about my new Fitbit, I barely slept, but it counted 7 hours, I definitely didn't feel like I got that much sleep. I went to check the sleep sensitivity setting, and it was set to sensitive. The next night, it said I got 8 hours. This has never happened. I'm so confused. Does the Alta (original) count light sleep as restless, and therefore doesn't put it into the overall sleep total? I can't figure out any other reason for this.
Hi, Last night I was tired and fell asleep on the couch. After a few hours a woke up and move to my bed. I could not fall asleep imidiately again and it took me about 1,5 to 2h to fall in sleep again. However, this morning when checking my sleep, I noticed Fitbit has recorded two sleep scores and does not seem to notice they are related (one is a poor and one fair), despite the fact that I slept about 8+ hours in total. Can Fitbit combine the "two" sleeps? How can I get a more accurate score? Thanks in advance!
That's great you're finding use for your Fitbit, and inviting others with sleep disorders to share  My post above was more for the other readers of the forum, just as a disclaimer. One thing I've learned is that the body seeks balance. If a person has a lot of mental activity, they may need the REM time to process it. If the body is stressed, it may need more deep sleep. But as you know, sleep disorders mess with that balance.

Hi Lynn, you said you had peripheral nueropathy; I had the same from colon ca chemo, does the mag help with just the sleep, or with other syptoms as well?
I have had a high heart rate after carrying a heavy object up a steep hill it was 182.I would check it when  not a sleep.. Try it with the non sensitive setting.
On normal mode, it logs me as awake ~1-2 times per night (I usually remember them) and restless between 10-20 times per night (I don't generally remember those).
Interesting... I notice I am getting a lot of light sleep but less than average of both deep sleep and REM sleep. I wonder if that’s why I feel like I can’t recall anything.
If you were clock watching and not moving your wrist Fitbit would still have you as sedentary, assuming you are asleep. It needs movement and measures our moving around while asleep.  My earlier post will only help if there was movement.

@donalduck.. hey there and yes they do. the reason in difference is the HR factor. your flex just knows you aren't moving. your HR knows you are at a resting HR for an extended period of time. I would trust the data of your C3 over the flex.

It's an automatic feature, and I don't think you can adjust it in any way. Many nights my time to sleep is 0, which means I pretty much fell asleep immediately (according to the tracker). If yours is showing 0, it is still logging. There is a sleep setting you can change from Normal to Sensitive in the app. I'm not sure how or if it would affect the time to sleep data, but you could give it a try.

78 was my sleep score. I wish fitbit would provide aggregate data back to the community, that would be fascinating.
Buy some Dual Action Melatonin 3mg and take it about 45 minutes before bedtime. Have you tried magnesium glycinate 400 mg about an hour before bedtime? Most individuals are deficient in magnesium. As we get older we produce less melatonin and sleep less because of that. The Mag will calm the nerves. I would take both. Sleep well.
I have the same issue.  Mine worked longer than a week but it recently started showing only sleep, restless and awake.  I can't figure out how to return it to the graphic mode.

Hi guys,I'm a new member to this forum. I need to find a solution to my back pain. Its been a few years since I'm experiencing this pain. But it became acute during these recent days only. So currently I'm having physiotherapy sessions to reduce my pain. While discussing with my friend he suggested using memory foam mattresses. He said its good for such pain and I clearly have no idea of this. So I have ordered a memory foam mattress online. I need to check whether it works or not.Has anyone used such mattresses? Is it really helpful? When I googled, I came to know that it relives body pains and painful pressure points. But I would like to get info from experienced people. Share your knowledge.Thanks!

Hi @Odyssey13, I have a Force but I assume there's basically the same firmware across them.  My Force allows me to push the button and go into sleep mode but it basically ignores the setting and reports when it thinks I went to sleep and awoke.  Are you sure it is honoring when the button is actually pushed? It's very frustrating.  I'm looking at replacing my Fitbit with the new Jawbone UP3 which requires you push the button to go to sleep.  When you awake, however, you can push button again or take 250 steps (vs. the device guessing that you are awake for 10 minutes).  It has a lot of other features too. By the way, another tracker device -- the Basis Peak -- which also has only auto-sleep has similiar complaints from its users. Best,Tahl (@tam94131)

@SunsetRunner Is your rate still high or increasing? Mine has come back down the past few days and is now back to 64 bpm, which is in line with my expectations from the last few months of tracking.
When I first get ,up and log my sleep, I noticed that I have a 200-300steps. I concluded that the it is probably the tossing and/or blood flowresults in inaccurate reading. The fitbits are not supposed to be 100%accurate anyway. Just take a look at the newest Consumer Report Feb 16issue. Fitbit Surge is rated 1 and HR rated 3 but the articles recognizethat while useful that they are appear to log more steps than you actuallytake.(see pages 21 and 33). I will just use it as a trend type device, butstill be open to learning more about what and how the date is useful to me.Have a good evening and don't fight the
I'm using some approximate times to simplify things, but my sleep log recently showed that I was asleep for 8 hours and awake for 1 hour. When I looked at my sleep log it showed asleep from 11:30pm to 8:30am, but the first 30 minutes of that it showed I was awake, so I actually slept from 12:00 to 8:30 with only 30 minutes of being awake. However if I edit my sleep log to say I went to sleep at 12:00, you would expect it to say I slept 8 hours and was only awake 30 minutes, but it actually says I was now awake for 58 minutes and only slept for 7 hrs 32 minutes, so reducing my actual sleep time by 30 minutes while keeping time awake basically the same. Why would all the other data change when I edited this sleep time? It's like it wants to convince me I'm awake more than I actually am.
I also suffer from sleep apnea and have a CPAP. I've actually not used mine in a while because I usually fall asleep on the couch in front of the TV since I work second shift. At some point in the night, I'll wake up enough to go to bed and then fall back asleep. Once I'm half asleep, I don't think clearly enough to realize what's going on around me. I keep telling myself I'm going to start using the CPAP again because my sleep is erratic. I found the nasal mask was not a good choice for me because I do have sinus problems and allergies. My nasal passages are frequently congested. I often breathe through my mouth when laying down. The full face mask was a better choice for me.

I'm in the same boat as all of you.  It started by delaying the calculation of actual sleep time by a few hours or so and then quit calculating sleep time altogether.  This is obviously a problem many people are having and needs to be address by fitbit!  Is anybody following this discussion and taking action???
I am 40 also have a deviated septum recently repaired, My best nights before the sugery was maybe 60% efficiency, already rolling up 75% and took a nap and got 99% (non dominant hand sensitive mode). Splints arent out yet and still really stuffed up so I am really looking forward to the final result.

@flguy wrote:I wondered about this, too.  I tried both the One and the Flex, and found they were roughly similar in their reporting times, but the Flex is so much easier to wear and keep on 24/7 that I returned the One and I'm sticking with the Flex.  Either way, the standard setting was definitely NOT reporting accurately for me.  I switched to sensitive and it's much, much more accurate. How do I know this?  I own a Dropcam (an extremely good, versatile device by the way), and have had it pointing at my bed for the past week.  It records movement "alerts" on its web-based timeline, as well a full real-time video, which I have been watching back each day.  The number of times my video camera shows me moving or awake is roughly similar to the sensitive setting on the Flex, so that is 100% proof, not just how I feel. That said, my sleep efficiency is around 70%.  I was shocked to see in the video how many times I actually moved or rolled around (clearly not "asleep").  Anywhere from 12-18 times, and this is while on 12.5mg Ambien CR and 1.5mg Xanax XR (not at the same time, just trying different things on different days per my doc's recommendation). So I have no idea what's going on with my body.  My room is very dark, cool, quiet and comfortable.  Neither my wife nor I snore (again, the Dropcam confirms all this).  What is wrong with me?  How can Ambien and Xanax not keep me asleep all night?  My problem is not falling asleep, it's staying asleep, especially once 3am rolls around, hence the CR/XR type prescription.  I am able to be in bed for 8-10 hours yet I am only getting around 6 hours of solid sleep.  A strong cup of coffee one a day in the morning is usually all it takes, and I don't feel too sleepy during the day, but still, I should be getting more sleep. I've tried all the over-the-counter stuff, too.  Nothing works.  Tried Lunesta and Sonata last month, as well.  It's like my body just ignores all medication.  I am not stressed or worrying about any consciously that I am aware of.  My therapist recommended the Fitbit so I could track all this stuff, and between that and the Dropcam, it's been very "eye opening" (pun intended).  So that's how I came to this site. Thanks for any advice or impressions.  Sorry if I've gone a bit off topic.  This is my first post.You should probably ask your doctor about getting a sleep study done, at this point.
I don't know the answer, but I share your sleep pattern. I'm consistently over the benchmark for REM and sometimes way over the benchmark. I do have bouts of insomnia and typically the day following a bad night's sleep, my REM sleep is way over the benchmark. I figure for whatever reason my brain prioritizes REM sleep or it has something to do with how the fitbit interprets and classifies my sleep patterns as REM sleep.
I love the new sleep stages.I know it's not accurate, but still it confirmes what I already suspected, my quality of sleep is not good. I am fast asleep, and I am not much awake during the night, but I am restless, and do have very little time in deep sleep.  (Due to pain I guess)Sleep insights reccomended a better bed og pillow ... But what can I do to increase time in deep sleep, and reduce restlessness?
I have no faith in the sleep tracker function-     As long as you lie relatively still in bed it counts it as sleep-   I usually sleep about half the time that is shown on the chart
I find my sleep results to be very inaccurate. Set to "normal", I'm sleeping 8+ hrs a night, while set to "sensitive" it's between 4 and 5 hrs a night. The range seems too broad. I believe I'm somewhere in the middle and have emailed Fitbit to change sleep senitivity settings to "high", "medium" and "low".Does anyone else have a similar experience with sleep sensitivity?

Hi @aaaaady Everyone is different, so you'll have to do monitor this for yourself to know how long it takes for get truly rested and keep in mind this will continue to change because of nutrition, environmental changes, and of course age. I'd suggest you start documenting your sleep, how you feel when you get up and if you notice more or less dark circles under your eyes. Good luck!

Hi @J2B2 , What I've noticed is two situations that sound like yours. One, is when I wake up in the middle of the night, and just lay in bed until I can fall asleep again.Two, is when I wake up and get out of bed, go to the bathroom, watch TV, etc. In the second situation, the fitbit always picks up the awake time and notes it.The first first situation, sometimes the fitbit still thinks I'm asleep. Because of this, I've concluded that the fitbit doesn't have any insight into whether at the brain level we are asleep or not. It can only go by movement patterns (and HR). The more a period of awake time is just being immobile, the more chance the tracker may not see the awake time as awake. Make sense?

Hey(:i went and had every test preformed. They couldn’t find anything alarming. She said she didn’t see any sign of heart disease or arrhythmia. She said some people just have a low HR...(:
If your seeing basic sleep data, first step to do is check the fitbit app. Tsp on the offending sleep record and read the note below the graph. in the next screen, after some research i discovered the Versa 2 update turned the heart rate off.

10  minutes? That seems like a very short timeframe. Interesting... I wonder if it is different if you sent your sleep tracking to sensitive vs regular.
I'm having the same problem
Any ideas on how to get enough sleep? I am only getting an average of 4-5 hrs. a day. No matter what time I go to bed and get up.

Sounds like you get more deep sleep than I do and I'm well within benchmark normally. how do you even find what is listed as the bench mark ? that doesn't seem healthy if that is the case . If it is better then average than why am I so tired after waking up and feel like I've been tossing and turning more then actually sleeping ? I think its time to hit the books and find out more about sleep in general .
Hi @TarrantP, Well awake time happens throughout the night, and so is considered part of the sleep period. The percentages of REM and Deep Sleep benchmarks are all set assuming there is awake time as part of the period. You can certainly calculate your own percentages on sleep time minus awake time, but if you do any research on the web for sleep cycles, you may find your numbers are off compared to what's commonly reported. So I wouldn't expect Fitbit to make a change in this regard without everyone else changing their numbers also.

Hi @Trumpalltheway , nice to see you back. Thank you for your update, and enhanced information.
As you mentioned, athletes can have a lower resting hear trate as the rest of us. It's nice that you have checked with your doctor regarding your resting heart rate. We can see what other Community members tell you about their resting heart rate. But remember that the information may vary  depending on the personal data (high, weight, age, etc). 
Please keep posting and I wish you a fitter week .

I received my Fitbit Charger 2 about a week ago. I did the update. I did not get the sleep stages for a few days but then all of a sudden I did. Yesterday It reverted back to just sleep/awake. I went in to advanced settings and set it to sensitive. It then changed to sleep stages. This morning it is right back to just sleep/awake and is still set on sensitive so I am unable to change it this time. As I said I did the update as soon as I received it. Any suggestions as to how to get the stages? I have a doctors appointment coming up and would like to show this to her.
Hi,I have noticed blank spaces in my sleep graphs, showing two separate sleep periods in the same night.  This has happened in three of the last seven nights.  One time, for instance, shows that I was not sleeping - presumably up and about for about 45 minutes around 2 a.m.  I have absolutely no memory of that happening. I wear my fitbit Charge on my dominant hand (watch already on the non-dominant wrist).  My setting is "normal." Has anyone else had this experience?  Can someone explain what I am observing?Thanks,TNF
That is a great story @HankMoodyThank you so much for sharing this with us 🙂
Is REM sleep synonymous with not moving? Can't you be in deep REM sleep and be dreaming and be moving about, but it's still deep beneficial REM sleep?
Ahh I just found it on my Iphone.  Apparently it is there but not on my computer.  Wonder if it is because the computer site was originally set up for a Fit One...
I emailed customer service - but have not received a reply. I am having the same problem - I want to change from sensitive to normal. jgilles, your comment reads exactly like the email I sent. So- taking it to twitter @fitbitsupport  And as much as I appreciate fellow useres taking the time to address one another's questions - it is poor customer service to not monitor boards and leave a topic open to speculation. Not bashing - but if something is broken -say so.
I have been a Fitbit user since 2013 but only recently started looking at my sleep score. I have always just looked at how much time I slept. I am confused by what the score means.Recently I have slept 6hr 13 min for a sleep score of 82, 7 hr 20 min for 84, and 8 hr 19 min for 85. How can three nights sleeps, differing so much in time, only show a 3 point sleep score difference?

Hi @AmandaGeorge, Too much sleep is linked to various poor health outcomes. "Individuals who sleep more than 10 hours per day generally have worse health profiles than those who sleep 7 to 8 hours," says Susan Redline, MD, MPH, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard and senior physician in the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.  Nearly 30% of adults in the US are in this group of "long sleepers." Logging lots of shut-eye becomes more common as you get older, and it's not entirely clear whether it's a sign that you have a disease or if it can actually make you sick. "The predominant opinion is that long sleep is a marker for underlying health problems," says Redline.

Hey @SunsetRunner nice to see you around. 
 
I noticed that you're talking about your sleep details after a long night. If you're having issues getting you sleep information on your Fitbit, I'd suggest to charge it and sync it with your mobile device. You can also check this very useful information about sleep: What should I know about sleep stages? If you need further assistance with this, you can post in our Help Community Forums.
 
I'd also recommend reading some tips on how to sleep better in our Fitbit Blogs, these are really helpful:

I know you are probably in a different state, but what did you pay for your sleep study? I have been considering one. I am sure I will be told that I am a restless sleeper too. I am in bed for 8-9 hours and get 3-4 hours of sleep a night. I don't think I have any of the sleep disorders. I am worried about taking melatonin because if you take it a lot it stops your body from producing it naturally. What does the antihistamine do? I heard someone tell me that Magnesium supliment help with sleep too. I have to research that. Last night I got one extra hour of sleep than I usually do (yay!) I took a warm shower right before bed and read in bed rather than watch TV to wind down. I plan to stop drinking beer after work (only one, but it can inhibit sleep) too. I follow all other sleep hygene techniques already. Ugh!
While your low points *might* be when you're in REM sleep, I don't believe it is possible to know that without a fairly sophisticated test with hardware far beyond a wrist tracker.  As for your question about the rate bouncing around, yes, that's normal; mine typically bounces up and down five or so beats per minute as shown on the daily 5-minute plot; here's a screen grab I took a few weeks ago:
Hi MonikaI agree with you.My Versa 2 works fine as well for what ai want it to.Actually the printout of how your sleep is. In the Restoration part mysleep was always fairly erratic with several yellow/orange peaks to sleeppattern. Somebody asked me did I suffer from Apnea? To which I replied notthat I know of.I went to Consultant as was always exhausted every day. I had to spend anight in hospital to have sleep test. The result was I have severepositional sleep apnea. I couldn't wear one of those CPAP machines as feelI'd suffocate. So slept for some weeks in fairly upright position butthat's boring. So purchased pillow that hold your head in correct position& does stop me from going on my back. The result in the Fitbit tracking ofmy sleep pattern without coloured peaks is amazing. My sleep apnea neverwoke me but now thanks to Fitbit printout I'm doing just fine. So I too amsatisfied with my Versa 2 & thankful to it for the apnea warning.Sincerely ,Ann.

Hi For the last 2 nights, my sleep has not registered at all what could the problem be or the solution? Thank you in advance Susan
Hello @Kgbow Welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thank you for the information and for the troubleshooting steps you've tried prior to posting! You should be able to edit your Bedtime and Wake-up time target after following the steps below: 
 
1. Tap the Today tab Fitbit logo in black, which looks like 13 circles in the shape of a diamond, where the circles are larger from left to right, then tap the sleep tile Icon of a purple moon with a Z next to it.2. Tap the gear icon in the top right.3. Set or edit your targets. To remove a target, tap the three dots in the top right.4. Tap Done.
 
If you still experience any inconvenience, I recommend making sure that the Fitbit App is up to date. If that doesn't help, please log out from the App one more time, force quit restart the Fitbit App, restart your mobile device and then try to log into the App and perform the steps to edit your targets. 
 
On a side note, take into consideration that your Fitbit device must update the time after syncing. If that is not the case, please take a look at: 
How do I change the time on my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps!

I am narcoleptic , I suspect my daughters are,  one has a fit bit and I am just getting to watch the sleep patterns.  I greatly appreciate you sharing this so I can compare.   She had Polysonogram,  which showed very mild apnea,  not enough to explain 13 full awakening and 93 partial awakenings during Polysonogram.   The nurse practitioner from neurology ar children's is clueless about sleep disorders,  migraines and non neurotypcal children,  not sure what she may be good at.    Anyway, thank you so much  sharing
When I am on the computer or watching tv, I find my mind is in overdrive and that leads to an awful nights sleep!What do you guys do to switch off?I find that having 30 mins away from devices helps to shut down for the night!
I went to sleep at 11:56 last night and woke at 5:25 this morning, my alta got what time i fell asleep right but i know i woke up once in the middle of the night which it recorded but i fell back asleep, it says i woke at 2:50 in the morning and stayed awake. So i typed in my end time manually and all these restless sleeps pop up, not understanding this tracking sleep. It said i was restless but i feel like i got a decent sleep for once
am set for sensitive and nondominant. I only see wake and asleep. have noticed no light comes on when I'm syncing.
I would also like to note what occurrences may have led to the sleep I got each night. Getting good sleep is important for a healthy body, and fitbit's goal is to help achieve that. Notes on sleep would help me change behaviors that cause difficulty falling asleep or restless sleep. On the other side, what did I do when I got a good, restful night of sleep. There are many factors for both.
I have a Blaze. My Iphone has the ios app, my Samsung tablet has the Android app.  Both have totally different sleep tracking results,  sometimes 2 hours difference for the same nights sleep. At least one, if not both,  is very inaccurate
I have been using a One for about a month now. Using the One in its wrist sleeve, on a typical night I am restless 12 times and awake at least once. Last night I used a Flex for the first time and my sleep pattern was very different. Apparently I was only restless twice and never woke up. I remember waking up and getting a drink from my nightstand twice. The data doesn't reflefct this at all. Is the Flex less sensitive?

What is an average of the # of times folks are awakened during the night?
Take a look at this Fitbit article that indicates that the average person can have many awakenings per night. The duration is so short, that we don't remember them. I'm not sure the placement of those tiny awakenings indicates a medical issue.But this is all new stuff. Thanks everybody for posting your charts.

having the same issue with the sleep score & sleep type no longer tracking on my Alta HR for the last 2 weeks.  In addition the food calories show as zero when you’ve chosen 1 food and it shows other foods usually eaten together when logging food.  I have reset twice, shut my phone off twice, recharged Alta HR and even uninstalled/reinstalled app.  Anyone have any ideas.
it is the same with me so i understand, maybe just try to wake up at the same time even if it is before your alarm.
Good idea. Using the fitbit as a way to collect data makes the most sense to me. I originally used mine to notice when I was active, when I wasn't. Then I could choose to make changes that fit into my life easily.
I'm a big fan of smoothies, red smoothies are my favorites.
 
As I'm a bad sleeper I started new habits. Struggling with what to eat before bed I came into try a Smoothie one hour before go to the bed.
 
For now I'm trying this recipe :  

2 bananas
2 tbsp. honey
2 tbsp. peanut butter
1 cup coconut milk sometimes yogurt

I place all the ingredients into a blender. Blend for 30 seconds.
 
Have you tried a smoothie or maybe a snack before sleep ? 😺

Your chart has similarities to mine. Straight from deep sleep to awake. I'm wondering if this is a sign of apnea. My wife says I do snore terribly loudly. I might need to get a sleep study done.
I am shocked to see that while my sleep efficiency is between 85% and 89%, I am restless between 30 and 48 times per night.  This is on the normal setting.  Does anybody else have high "restless" readings on normal?
I unfortunately have sleep and anxiety issues so I am prescribed Xanax to help me sleep without having night terrors. I take it about 2 hours before bed and this helps relax me and makes for a peaceful, screaming,crying free night. However I would like to eventually stop taking these pills and switch to something more natural in the future. I also use relaxing sounds such as water to calm me down and make me sleepy as well. However I will try some of the tips everyone has shared such as no distractions like light, tv, or personal devices before bed time.
I don't take my computer with the App. to bed with me. My suggestion was for the Blaze itself not the App.

My band use to come apart as well.  What I did was order a few of the extra clasps, plus bought the 3-color pack.  I now just clasp each band together so that the holes are use to being clasp together.  At first it is hard to get them to "snap" in, but try clasping together before putting on your wrist.  Wiggle the clasp back and forth until you hear a "click"  Also, make sure that the clasp is sort of depressed in the band.  I was having a hard time getting it to lock in place until I realized the clasp was not seated tightly.  You almost have to "walk" it in by stretching the band a bit to make sure the clasp is depressed. Again, you'll hear a little click to know that the clasp is seated properly.  It just takes practice before you are good at it.
Tried contacting customer service with no help at all, they blamed me even after i tried all their suggestions.

@N8teGee : is the 6.1 hr bar that shows on your graph the average hours slept for the week?! On my graph, it’s 7.5 hr, and it’s definitely not average hours slept, but rather the goal I have set.

I also wake up with any little noise. I have found that a box fan for white noise has helped me sleep better. My husband had slept on an aircraft carrier when he was in the Navy and insisted we use a fan. At first I hated it but now I can't sleep without it. Now I need to work on drinking all my water early in the day so I don't keep waking up! Try a fan it just might help. It can't hurt, right?

By the way, I should've mentioned that I have a Blaze, and the App is on my iphone.  As far as I know I haven't updated the app or my ios in the 13 months or so I've been using it now.
Alcohol makes you fall into a very deep sleep and the deep sleep will be longer than normal. You kinda "pass out" in a sense from drinking and stay in a deep sleep until you sober up.
HI, very new to this as this was a christmas present.By the way i love my new fitbit charge 3Please can someone advise me as to the sleep settings when you are a night worker.Can you enter times in advance say for a whole week or do you have to change daily.I sleep at different times of the day and night due to shift work.Any advice would be welcome.THankyou

Like @Dominique  I have to get up at night, and last night 4 times, and once to the kitchen, and it always shows as wake time.  My sleep score last night was 85 and 8hr 8min sleep. I had a good score again in Restoration which had me 74% under my RHR which gave me 20/25 Unfortunately mine is after more serious problems with my prostate and now my brain is starting to learn again to go to the bathroom which is great....  Last night the steps show, and include restless night because it's been warm at night.  I have never had issues with the sleep recording on my Ionic. But in saying that, if something wakes me, and I realize I have been awake for over an hour it breaks my sleep graph into two graphs, one normal graph over 3 hours, and the other, because it's less than 3 hours, the older format graph.  That knocks the sleep score about.

Suggest you/Fitbit staff place a brief explanation of the differences on the chart -- it took me an hour to find your good explanation of the differences in the sleep chart graphs
Have you learned anything, seeing as this is an old post? I have the same thing. My graphs look much like yours. My resting daytime rate is lower than my nighttime rate which throws off my Fitbit stats. Sleep studies have revealed no oxygen issues. My doctor says that he believes it's a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, but I cannot find any data or anecdotal evidence to back this guess up.
Hi guys,  Does anyone else who has either a Charge HR or Surge notice a large spike in their heart rate upon waking/getting out of bed? I know that the rate should go up to the 'waking' level, but mine seems to spike higher for a few minutes before coming back down to the baseline 'awake' level. (See the charts below) I been figuring this had to do with the extra work my heart is doing to start pumping blood against gravity when I stand up, but I was wondering if everyone else gets this or if it is just me? Any input is appreciated.  Thanks.
I'm guessing that in broad-strokes more total time and more deep sleep are each favorable to lesser, and also higher percentage of deep sleep is good---whereas increased proportion of light sleep and to lesser extent REM is negative. Is this accurate? And what about the finer brushtrokes (the specifics)? What has me somewhat puzzled is the looseness of correlation between my total sleep time and the score. Although when I get 8+ hours of sleep recorded my score is usually at least decent (unsurprisingly), some days it records especially small amount yet with a score better than poor: just yesterday it recorded my total duration as measly 2h41m yet with a respectable score of 65(within 'Fair'). Why is this? I do feel like for thr most part the scores are accurate-ish, but as for the sleep duration.. meh. dunno, but I think I got more slumber than 3h!Is it weighted by previous days' scores? Relatedly: how does it partition days (for sleep recordings/allocations)? especially considering polyphases.
This is the only data I've seen since Christmas every night... no sleep stages like REM act...
@KittyBee if you look in "Meditations for Sleep", Rachel leads one the called "Relax from Head to Toe".

I agree with this 100%.  Why are you forcing this feature on people who liked the old way.  Make Sleep score OPTIONAL!!!!
Here is some information I found this morning. It’s a bit odd really. The night before last my sleep data was shown in sleep stages and yet when I woke up this morning the data was shown in the vertical lines. So I’ll have to have another look at the information I was sent by Fitbit. When it worked the night before last I thought the problem had been resolved and so didn’t bother to read their emails.I’ll let you know if I find something out.StuartWHY DON'T I SEE SLEEP STAGES TODAY?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your device’s battery is critically low.For more information about why you see your sleep pattern, tap or click the sleep record that shows your sleep pattern.
If being alot of restless, or difficult staying asleep (waking up alot).. it can be a indication of overtraining from exercise, possible injury, sickness.. or the light of a alarm clock.. external sounds.. can also influence sleep quality..  A hour before sleeping, best to avoid using electronics if possible.. to clear the mind of any worries, to help getting asleep faster. If lifestyle allows to, going to dream and waking up at about the same time can help to.
I had the exact same problem last night. I have been searching all morning to try to figure out why it did not record. If anybody knows please reply and let me know
The original Flex had a feature that allowed the user to manually start and stop sleep tracking. The new Flex 2 doesn't have this feature but rather an automatic method to start/stop sleep tracking, which I (and many other FitBit users) find to be very inaccurate regarding actual sleep start time and therefore the entire sleep log, as compared to the manual method of the original Flex. A request to the FitBit software team.... I would like to see the manual method to start/stop sleep tracking re-implemented into the Flex 2 (as well as all existing FitBit devices). I believe this change would have a positive effect on recorded sleep logs and will show the FitBit community that you are actively supporting your customers and products.
Anyone else getting multiple sleep logs for one night?   Both started at the same time (930pm), one ended at 1am the other at 620 am.  The one with 1am end time had no data so I delete it.  Now I show 5.25 hours of sleep even though I slept closer to 9. Confusing and frustrating.

I recently purchased a Sleep IQ bed from Sleep Number.I was wondering if there was any development planned for sharing of the sleeping information from the Sleep IQ systrem/application with FitBit for sleep monitoring?  One more step in tying it all together. Also if there were others that had purchased the Sleep IQ bed and had the same desires. Thanks
My sleep stages have been reading for the last few nights. I hope that means it has been resolved now. I hope you and your wife's are working too.  Thanks for your help 🙂
Sleep on someone else's mattress, and see if that helps.  Maybe you need a new one. I swapped mine, even though my old one was comfortable, and now I sleep better and don't feel back stiffness.If you have trouble falling asleep, download and play free audio books (librivox.com), the more boring the better (economics or similar), and try to concentrate on the narrator. Set your player to shut itself off after 30 min or so. It helped me. I listened to the first few minutes of chapter 1 of "Tess of the d'Urbervilles" for about 3 months! CheersPaul
How come on the sleep log the same two charts show 2x each? Times awoken & time asleep?

I get the same problem intermittent sleep stages, two or three nights "Stages" then "Simplified" version. I'm on my third Fitbit (Charge 2 now) & still not resolved. Whenever I complain I get whatessentially is "fobbed off" with different excuses! I need to monitor my sleep for health reasons so when "Stages" appeared I was very happy, now I can't monitor it as I used to.
I've been using my Charge HR for several months now, and I really like it. However, one area that I think could be improved is the sleep tracking. If I set it to 'normal' it does a good job of tracking how long I've been in bed, but always over-estimates my actual sleep. For example, if I sit up and read for an hour it counts that as being asleep. If I set it to 'sensitive' it seems to count every slight movement as me being awake, so it massively underestimates my sleep. I'd like a setting in between, so it detects periods of actual wakefulness and restlessness but register small movements as being awake. Is this something that a future firmware update could include?
Hey thanks guys for answering my query. When I actually get up, I am usually fine within a minute or two.  Even if I've had "only" 7-8 hours.  I have always had this problem -  also when I was on fluoxtine and even if on no mediation - but then unmedicated depression can make you feel tired.  It's complicated, eh?! Yeah, there are so many reasons to knock the booze on the head.  Easier said than done though! I just have such a comfy, quiet bed and maybe I'm just a lazy cow to be honest.  But my sleep graphs look as if I'm dead!! It's just one big long blue line for 12 hours.  Maybe with a tiny pink blip if my mum comes in to try and wake me! Thanks again...I will mention it to my Dr.  Hadn't realised just how different my sleep is to others'.  Rather this way than insomnia though!! That sounds like real hell!
I had a great deal of trouble sleeping, until a Nurse Practitioner suggested that I be tested for sleep apnea. I was diagnosed, and with the aid of my CPAP machine, I can now sleep through the night. Just a thought…
Make sure you are looking at right day.  Sleep is always credited to the day you wake up, not the day you go to bed.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I have the same questions...will call them (if I can) to try to re-synch.  Still...disappointing.
How are you doing my friend @MY969? Nice to see you around.
 
Thank you for reporting this information. Can you please confirm what model of device are you using to see your sleep details? Is this still happening? If you can add an screenshot, it'd be of great help.

My FitBit stopped recording my sleep about a week ago.  I have rebooted it and checked for updates to no avail.  Has anyone found a fix for this?
Last week was the first week of using my Flex, I set it to "sensitive" and my sleep efficiency ranged from 66% to 80%. Yesterday I set my tracker to the "normal" setting. Last night's SE was 86% for the first hour (I always have trouble falling asleep due to anxiety), then I shut off the sleep mode when I got up to go to the bathroom. Upon returning to bed, I turned the sleep mode back on and had a SE of 98% for the rest of the night. Woo hoo!
@mis-fit-bit you didn't answer the question from @MakMak about whether your Inspire 2 is recording your heartrate. It is necessary to have heartrate turned on in order to track your sleep. It is possible that your device is in "clip" mode. In that case, the heartrate monitor will not be turned on. To check this, press and hold both buttons on the sides of the Inspire 2. You'll get a list of settings. Swipe up until you get to the last one. It should say "On Wrist", if you want see your heart rate and sleep. If it says "On Clip", tap on that and change it to "On Wrist".

Hey all! I just saw a neurologist for the first time for excessive daytime sleepiness for the past 5 years. I've actually fallen asleep at the wheel, in class, in meetings, in theaters, recently at the dentist, while in an MRI machine, while standing up during my surgery rotation and scrubbed in (I'm now a physician assistant) and at the hairdresser. I'm 30 years old, no medical conditions, I run 5 miles or more per day and I'm a very healthy eater. My neurologist scheduled me for a sleep study to formally diagnose narcolepsy. I've had several confirmed cases of cataplexy and hypnogogic hallucinations. I frequently have vivid dreams while napping for 10 minutes. I'm weaning myself off of Effexor (venlafaxine) because the neurologist said that this drug suppresses REM sleep and will create a false negative sleep study. It is also prescribed to suppress cataplexy.  My question is, how accurately does the Fitbit charge 2 detect awakenings and R.E.M. Sleep? I have several nights where I've gone from being awake straight into R.E.M. Sleep which is the hallmark of narcolepsy. I know this cannot replace a formal sleep study but I'm just very curious!  Here are a few examples of going straight into R.E.M. Sleep. And this is on Effexor which has helped me immensely with my symptoms!

I spent a while on the FitBit online Chat help facility tonight with a request to see the validity and reliability (extrernal benchmarking for accuracy) data for the FitBit sleep measurement function. Despite having a very helpful and patient Customer Service Helper, they did not have access to such data. I may lodge a request for the same data via email tomorrow to see if I can see it.
yes, I would love to have the functionality to download the following data:1) "restless" sleep data,2) number of active hours (250+ steps) .3) heartrate data
yea
Hi @SherryLong I use a hybrid mattress--it uses springs under memory foam. It's pretty firm, which is what my back likes. It's really difficult to tell what exact mattress works for each person. I got lucky.  Next time I get a mattress, I'll go to a bunch of different stores and lay down on the mattresses they have out on display. Maybe take a nap or two. 🙂

You probably should not read in bed. In general, if you tend to wake, it's a good idea to do nothing in the bedroom except change clothes, sleep, and have sex. No reading, TV, radio, or whatever.However, if you've already solved the problem, this may be irrelevant for you. The above advice is for people who have serious problems. I hope you continue to sleep well.
Yikes! That's a scary thought!
Hi @HIM46, Which fitbit app are you using?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Sleep is recorded regardless of whether bluetooth is on or not, so your tracking of it will be fine. Currently, there aren't notifications for water consumption. If you do a search on the Feature Suggestion forum of this site, I believe there is that request there, which you can vote for (or propose yourself if it's not there). With enough votes, Fitbit may implement it.

Out of the blue as of December 1st 2022 my sleep is not being tracked.  I have refreshed, synced and checked all settings but it still isn't tracking.  Any suggestions as to why this would all of a sudden stop?
Likewise, I have the Charge HR and received the announcement, but the app does not reflect the change. I have version 2.22 on an Android tablet, which appears to be up to date.
I normally get less than 6 hours sleep a night.  The problem with working two jobs with one having you get up at 3:30 am four days a week.  My deep sleep on a good day is less than an hour.  My more common time is about 10-15 minutes.  I wake up constantly worried about not sleeping.  Crazy, trying to get more sleep.  Summer is the worst because it is light till 9 pm.  Can't get up and read when you are pushing sleep less than 6 to begin with.
Something I read again today during research: "The main problem that too much REM sleep would cause in most people would be the possibility of waking up more often and ending up not as rested. Since REM sleep is quite similar in a lot of ways to waking brain activity, and can cause awakening by prompting the muscles to flex or jerk, excessive REM sleep can leave you feeling tired and depressed." In saying that, I have noticed I am awoken a lot when I first fall asleep by my arm jerking or something like that almost every night. Don't know if this has anything to do with it or not.
Yes, I did the same thing, but over all, it really doesn't matter.  You will have lots more data to add.
I recently updated my CHarge 3 and now it won't track sleep or steps.  Only shows time.
Um mine always looks like that and now I'm concerned.
Hi @galaga6846, Cool name! Yes, the sleep tracking with the Alta HR is a bit different. The new sleep stages aren't broken down as restless/awake. I find it's possible to lay in bed awake, but still, and have the tracker think it was light sleep. I also get better results using sleep set to normal rather than sensitive. You may want to try it and see if it works better. Can you share for one of these nights, how much time in Awake, Light, Deep and REM? It might help to figure out the pattern.

Hi all, I’m having the same issues since Saturday! I bought the Fitbit mainly for the sleep analysis and now I can’t see it anymore! This is unacceptable...has anyone found a way to have it back without going premium?
Thanks for the good feedback.  I do wear it in the same place each night, left writs in the sleeve.  Have had a couple of really awful days at work, so will be anxious to see if my sleep pattern shows some difference now. Thank you
Nice to see that you're digging into the Fitbit Forums @Tara19866, let me give you a warm welcome to our community. 
 
You came to the right place! We really like to engage this type of topics. Since sleep is an essential function that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. We want to give you some tips that might help you, healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly. Being said that, you can improve your sleep by paying attention what is your sleep pattern. Are you having insomnia every night? Are you under a lot of stress? Are you taking medication? 
 
All this is important, since as soon as you start noticing those small details you will realize you can start makin big changes. Take a look of these blog entries: 5 Ways to Better Manage Anxiety—and Get Better Sleep in the Process and The Night Shift Worker’s Guide to Getting Better Sleep.

I use the app on my phone to turn it on and off and that works so much better.  I could never get it to work properly with the "tap" method.
On the sleep log page, https://www.fitbit.com/sleep you should be able to click either edit or delete in the "Sleep" section.  On the upper right corner above the graph, or each graph if there is more than one, you should see an edit symbol (paper with pen) and an X when you hover the mouse over the graph.  Click the X and that item disappears.  If it doesn't, open a case with Fitbit support. However, since you only want to change PM to AM, click on edit and make the changes to start and stop times.
I would also like to know how you guys are seeing a percentage of your sleep?
It apparently was a changing of the setting to "Sensitive" from "Normal" that was the culprit. Thank you!
It's a rounding issue.  The Website is a little more accurtate and can showing readings between 73 and 74.  Where as the phone cannot.  So something like a 73.51 reading shows up as 73 on the app, but shows up halfway between 73 and 74 on the website, and round up to 74.

I've been curious about the amount of restlessness also.  Most nights I seem to be 13x to 18x.  I've had as low as 7x.  Most people seem to be concerned with their sleep effieciency number, but if you have a high amount of restlessness, I don't believe that is good.  The thing I'm wondering is 13x - 18x of restlessness average?
That's what I thought! When I emailed fitbit help they told me to post onhere. Who cares about average time per sleep?
I agree with all the points said above. Sleep is one of the most important work to do if you want to feel fresh and energetic next morning. But due to some problem like insomnia and pest issues like bedbugs one cannot take a full sleep. Creepy bedbugs are one of the most common issues of disturbance in sleep.They don't only disturb, but leaves a red rashes on the skin, which seems very disgusting in the next morning. So apart from eating healthy it is always good to maintain cleanliness in room by having pest controlling done from the best pest exterminator UES to get rid of pest issues in night.
@Bartfliet. I know. 😂 To be honest with you, I wouldn't like to be wearing one either but if I have to, I'll be looking for tips about how to adjust it and wear it in a comfortable way 😅
 
Nice to see you around, @SunsetRunner. Wow 😮, nice input and thanks for sharing! I'll take this into consideration.

Hi, I'm thinking of purchasing a Fitbit (Versa 3, Charge 4, Sense?!?). I will be using it SPECIFICALLY for tracking sleep, not much else. So I just want to see if it will be able to do what I'm seeking before spending the money and wasting the time. I struggle with 2 issues I'd like to be able to track as accurately as possible:Excessive tossing from one side to the other.Being awoken in early morning, sometimes accompanied by elevated heart rate (e.g., waking from a 'stress' dream). - I'm guessing it should be relatively easy to see when & how often I'm tossing from one side to the other, correct? - How accurately can you see when you have an instance of elevated heart rate (not quite a mini panic-attack, but dreaming of running real hard)? Do you see the specific time of elevation and when it returns to 'normal'? - If you wake up but are staying still (trying desperately to get back to sleep), is there any manual way that you can indicate that you're definitely awake, possibly repeating on occasion if still awake? E.g, tapping the screen, twisting your wrist rapidly, etc.? - Can you add notes to logs for specific days after-the-fact (maybe add some comments about what happened during the night)? Being able to see if there is a pattern as to when I'm waking up, and how often I'm staying awake, will be very helpful in seeing what's going on. The last thing I want to do when I'm awoken in the night is remove my eye mask, look at a bright clock, and try to remember times to make notes in the morning! I'm fighting to stay as 'asleep' as possible ; ) And if there are other devices that might do this better, I'm wide open. THANKS!

All Fitbits have a tendency to do that and that is why we can change a sleep record to an activity record and vice versa.  Setting the sleep to sensitive just exaggerates the graph, but you can swap between that at any time when you view your graph in the Sleep, Log by editing and saving.  No need to make a permanent change at this stage. My Surge and Charge HR will do that, the other night I was watching TV and I had the Charge HR on my wrist and there it was a sleep record so I just deleted it. Did you have the Workout set to on on the Surge ? or was it just detecting very low activity ? Also the other evening my sleep record showed 59 minutes at the start as restless and then sleep. Do you know how to create an activity record, which is a copy of your data and then you can look at the calories recorded in one minute increments. If you haven't done that before. go to your Log, Activities and click on the Large Stopwatch and enter the time period. and update. You then click on the small stopwatch near the description and analyse your data. Let's see how you go with that and some other Fitbitters in the Community can also guide us.

Hello @pwung0327, it's great to see you around! 
 
Your overall sleep score is a sum of your individual scores in "sleep duration, sleep quality, and restoration", for a total score of up to 100. Most people get a score between 72 and 83. Sleep score ranges are:
 

Excellent: 90-100
Good: 80-89
Fair: 60-79
Poor: Less than 60

Duration: Time asleep and awake: the more you sleep, the better your score. But take into consideration that the two other scores below, count. 
Quality: Deep & REM sleep: how much time you spent in deep and REM sleep, so the more time you spend in these sleep stages, the better your score. 
Restoration: Sleeping heart rate & restlessness: How relaxed you were during sleep, a high sleeping heart rate or too much tossing and turning lowers your score. For more information, please check: What's sleep score in the Fitbit app?
 
For your inquiry about HRV, please check How do I track heart rate with my Fitbit device? and for sleep stages, please see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
Sleep stages are traditionally measured in a lab using an electroencephalogram to detect brain activity along with other systems to monitor eye and muscle activity. While this method is the gold standard for measuring sleep stages (source), your device can estimate your sleep stages in a more comfortable, convenient way.
 
Hope this helps!

I kept checking to see if anyone else had the same RHR issues. You were thefirst to respond. Thanks for responding.The new pattern seems to be a completely different algorythm and, like you,a narrower range several points higher than before the update.They better get their arms around this feature quickly and not screw upworking features. Very disappointing rollout.--David
I'm a bit of a thinker and a curious person, and paired with a restless sleeper since childhood, I will often find myself thinking about ANYTHING my brain can when I should really be asleep! I try singing in my head, reading before bed, restricting device use, but I still have a racing mind most nights.  Any suggestions about how to calm my mind? I'd love to hear people's techniques for falling asleep too! Sleep is my main goal to improve... especially with all these early mornings

My sleep monitoring should be changed to a more sensitive setting: how can this be changed?
@Casyis  Nice comparison. I compare the ChargeHR on my left wrist with my Flex on the right wrist. The ChargeHR does auto tracking and I have to tap the Flex to put it to sleep. They are very close to having the same times and quality of sleep. Welcome to the forums.

First remove alcohol for a period.  Also don't have coffee within 6 hours of bedtime.  Then if it persists, see your GP and discuss.  They will probably refer you to a sleep study. My GP suspected sleep apnea and the symptoms were largely identical to yours.  A sleep study confirmed and after a couple of weeks with my dental appliance, I'm sleeping a solid 6.5-7 hours a night, with no wakeups, and no afternoon naps.  That was 7 years ago.  If I don't have my dental appliance in, then I revert to the same old broken sleep pattern. I'm not saying sleep apnea is your problem but a sleep study will tell your doctor what's going on.
You can build your own basedline with normal or sensitive settings. For me, sensitive seems to have more room for motivation.
Hi, new to Fitbit. The sleep graph changed, now is all blue row and small columns, no REM,  how to interpret?
I am 72 and have actively been using Charge Two FB for a little over 2 months, only remove for shower and charging.  Bought for same reason as you (1) track sleep, so can reduce temazepam use at bedtime (2) weight management - not tracking food with FB but have greatly increased my steps & my dog helps (3) track hydration, hopefully more water, less pop/soda :0) My automatic night tracking by fitbit of potty breaks (times are amazingly accurate), occasional emergency middle of the night out request by our Shar-pei Midnight Legend, my husband accidentally waking me up as he adjusts his CPAP machine, etc. has been pleasing, all through reading my heart rate.  The start and stop sleep times have been accurate except twice where they were several hours short.  I then edited the time at my best guess and when FB updated, the detail WAS there !  Weird. I am pleased for my fitbit friend in my life.  So far it has not increased my sleep time but has better explained how I am sleeping.  And I have reduced sleep meds by at least half in two months, a good feeling.
I love to exercise in the evenings but it makes it very difficult for me to get to sleep. Only if I exercise before midday does it seem to have no impact. Any ideas what is going on? Feels like it takes that long for my heart\body to return to normal. Thanks.
This was suggested in 2013 ... never mind, obviously Fitbit doesn't care about getting this feature implemented.

I almost never wear my fitbit on my wrist due to my job (massage therapist) and lifestyle (gardening/hands in dirt) I have found that it's fairly accurate to wear it around my ankle, but I'm wondering if that's the same for sleep?I often feel like I get much more sleep than my fitbit records. I average 4 hours a night sleeping & another 4-4.5 restless/awake. I've tried many different natural things to help my sleep & help me stay asleep.. but I wonder if my fitbit thinks I'm awake more often just due to moving my feet in my sleep, even while in the deepest REM cycle.Has anyone experimented with both wrist and ankle sleep tracking and found one to feel more accurate since it's hard to know what's really going on?
Does anyone know what the answer is to this? Mine spiked to at 1:16, and the numbers are different between the time zone heart rate graph and resting heart rate zone graph.

I've had a frustrating experience with Fitbit's tech support regarding Premium sleep reports. I had e-mail correspondence with 9 different members of Fitbit's tech support team beginning on March 14. One suggested that to get a more accurate picture of my sleep that I medicate myself. Here's a copy of that e-mail.   I have sleep apnea and a form of general insomnia for which the cause has yet to be determined. I don't have any trouble falling asleep but I do have trouble staying asleep and waking up too early. Those are two of the the three qualifications of insomnia per both The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the DSM-V. I've been impressed with how accurate the tracker has been recording my fractured sleep. More often than not I wake up 2-4 times per night - not counting the times I'm restles/awake per the tracker - and can be awake anywhere between fifteen minutes and an hour and a half before going back to sleep. Fitbit's tracker gets all of this. Here's a good example. The problem is that while the tracker gets it right, and the information displayed on the Dashboard is also right, that the Premium Sleep reports - for which we pay - only grab the longest sleep log. So on March 6, where I met my goal of 7 hours of sleep (admittedly not an idea 7 hrs of sleep), the app and the Dashboard both reflect the total time asleep, which was 7hr and 59m.  The Report Section records 5 hours. Here's a shot of that week's report. The Sleep Reports are trying to help us sleep better. But how can they do that without using all of the information logged on the tracker? There's actual analysis on that page, and for the above referenced week, the analysis was this that I got more sleep than only 3 percent of men my age, that I was averaging 4 hrs of sleep every night, that I'd improved over last week - but all of that was wrong, because their entire analysis - all the data on that page! - is working off incomplete data. The first Tier Two tech to handle this case, and the 8th with whom I communicated, wrote, "Premium only captures the first sleep record of the day. In order for you to see the sleep record, in Premium, the way you desire, the record must be edited. Using the sleep record from 3/7 as an example for this troubleshooting routine, delete the logs for 3/7 5:16 am - 7:26 am and 9:31 am - 10:00 am. Once that is done edit the record for 12:47 am - 4:31 am to have an end time of 10:00 am, the time you actually woke up. Once edited in this manner your sleep log should more accurately record the sleep activity for the night of 3/7. You may edit your future sleep logs in this way if this produces a satisfactory report." Three problems with this.It doesn't capture the first sleep record. It captures the longest sleep record.The purpose of a tracker is for automated tracking. Manually editing sleep records, especially if you're someone who wakes up often during the night, ends up being a lot of work- work that Fitbit doesn't want us to do.The suggestion itself doesn't work. I replied to that e-mail including a screen shot of the dashboard pre- and post-edits. I'll post those here.  If you look at the premium report above, it reports 3hr and 29m of sleep for March 7, because it pulled the longest sleep record on March 7 prior to the suggested edits. Right now, it shows 8hr and 8min. When the last email arrived acknowledging all of my assertions regarding data reporting were accurate, that person said he would forward the information to their team - whichever team that might be - and couldn't promise any changes. I wrote back asking for someone other than tech support to contact me as I felt the frustrations I had with with tech support needed to be heard. And someone other than tech support needs to know they have at least one staff member who offered medical advice that would be illegal for even a Registered Nurse to offer. What if I'd taken that advice? What if instead of the normal sleep meds that I take, I doubled them? And before getting into bed, not used to the increased dosages and increased sedation that came with it, I stumbled, fell, and cracked my head on something? This was a really horrible experience with their tech support team. Bad enough for me to reconsider having bought into their whole ecosystem and start to look somewhere else.
I have the same challenges.   I am up anywhere from 1-4 times a night to pee (I drink a lot of water throughout the day).   My old fitbit (one of the earliest) understood this. My nightly sleep pattern showed and broke out each sleep chunk wether an hour or several hours long.    My present fitbit (charger 2} does not.   According to it, I have only slept about 10 hours in the last two weeks (initial sleep to first pee break), less if you factor in restless sleep.   Am I dead?   Am I dreaming that I am living?   The first fitbit didn't ask for sleep parameters.  Can I eliminate these?  I'm retired and my sleep schedule changes whenever I need it to.

fitbit says i woke up about 10 times during the night once for over 12 minutes , i dont remember any of it and i feel great when i woke up, is it tracking my movement as being awake ? thanks
Yes my Charge5 give sleep data  every day
I'm curious why you think 'sensitive' is a better option for your sleep log? I would think that logging regular sleep would give you a good indication of when you are asleep vs awake, based on what you said. Yes, the red bars indicate restless vs awake. Starting and stopping the tracker during the night is potentially just going to give you confused data if/when you forget. I personally use the regular setting, lay down in bed, push the button and then forget the device until I get out of bed in the morning. I am able to see what times during the night I am more restless/awake and which times during the night I am sound asleep. If I get up during the night it registers this as awake and I am docked sleep minutes as expected. But I never have to remember to turn things on/off. Remember, the tracker is trying to give you a full picture of your life, so the idea that you are restless, get up, sleep soundly, whatever is all part of the big picture.
That's correct, it uses your profile data such as age, gender, weight etc. There's more info on this here: https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/898903

Looks good to me."It’s normal to see awake minutes in your sleep stages; studies have shown a typical adult could wake up briefly between 10-30 times per night (source). You may not remember waking up since you likely fell right back to sleep, especially if you were awake for less than 2-3 minutes at a time."

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I've always been a bad sleeper. I wake up at the slightest noise (I now wear earplugs), toss and turn during the night, and have even been diagnosed with sleep apnea (based on my pallet shape, not weight). I've tried a B-pap machine in the past but couldn't sleep with it on my face.  When I get 9+ hours of sleep (very rare, maybe once a month), I wake up feeling AMAZING. I go all day and have no problems powering through my workouts.   I've tried a number of things to get more sleep but my question is has anyone been able to adjust their bodies to thrive (not just survive) on less sleep? If so, how?
@lulubo1982 Personally?  I would go and ask for an ECG to rule out anything a lot more serious that your FitBit being at fault here.  

	Blaze, Surge, Ionic and Versa1. I am not a FitBit employee.
Isn't anyone from FitBit - or anywhere - able to explain what the variations in the O2 Oxygen Variation Screen differ from? And what is nomad relative to each of our statistics? If not, why bother have this?
My Fitbit is not tracking sleep for the last three days (starting sept1). Reset did nothing. It shows the hours correctly but not the stages.suggestions?
There should be no harm in lending your FB to your friend.  Just make note of the date and direct your friend to "that night" for their sleep results.  More "lent" nights will confirm what your friend may be feeling / lacking in sleep for the next day.  First make sure your sleep data is correctly registering for your profile.  Good luck.
Every morning when I check how long I slept, my dashboard always tells me how many minutes I spent 'awake' during the night (usually around 45 minutes sometimes and hour). What does 'awake' mean? Does that mean times I moved or times I've actually woken up, and if so how can my Fitbit tell I've woken up? AND also how do I bring that number of minutes down? I really want to get more solid sleep. Thanks-Katelyn

I'm looking for a device that can A) monitor my blood oxygen level at night and B) wake me up when my blood oxygen level is low. There are several dedicated blood oxygen monitors that a person can wear to bed and when the oxygen level gets low, the device will vibrate to wake the person up. This would be a tremendous help to me, because I have sleep apnea that only occurs when I sleep on my back. A blood oxygen monitor that vibrates when my oxygen is low can wake me up enough to turn over on my side. I would much rather buy a FitBit than a dedicated blood oxygen monitor, but the FitBit would only meet my needs if it could alert me when my blood oxygen is low. Are there any fitbits that can do this?

I personally believe if the body is doing something out of the ordinary or showing physical signs of something out of the ordinary it's usually related to diet or stress. There was a time when I was sleep walking. My husband said I would go in to the living room and sit down going from seat to seat until I went back to bed. This had to be related to stress that I was having at the time, but it eventually stopped. I began exercising and eating better for a different reason, but the sleep walking began to decrease and then stopped all together. Exercise elevates mood so I would think exercising is a great stress reliever.
Sleep tracking is based on heart rate and physical movement I believe.

I'm looking to buy a fitbit, mainly to track my sleep. I'm lost as to which one is best for this and looking for a bit of help from you lovely people 🙂
I have only had my Flex a couple of weeks, but I've noticed the same thing. Mine seems to do it while I'm pushing a shopping cart over a rough floor or tapping a spice jar (kinda like hitting a ketchup bottle). Mine's on "normal" sleep mode. I did notice that when I log in, those accidental sleep modes aren't recorded at all, so no problem there. Good luck!
Hello everybody! 😁🤗
 
How was your weekend? Were you able to rest and sleep well? 😴💤 
 
What Types of Exercises Are Best For Insomnia? 
While the options for exercise routines and movements are numerous, I was reading that only moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, like walking, has been shown to relieve insomnia. Vigorous aerobic exercise, like running or resistance weight lifting, has not been shown to improve sleep. Do You Think This is Kind Of Correct? 
 
I was told that just a single 30-minute exercise session can reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep, and help you sleep longer overall. But these effects are stronger when you undertake a regular exercise program. Moderate aerobic exercise can help relieve other symptoms associated with insomnia, too. For individuals with comorbid insomnia and anxiety, it can significantly lower pre-sleep anxiety, reducing the anxious thoughts that make it tough to fall asleep.
 
I wonder which type of workouts have helped for you? In my personal experience "Walking" is certainly helping me, but I'd love to read your comments and put it practice any other workout based on your own experiences 
 

 
See you around!

Hi everyone, I got the Fitbit Charge 4 last month & recently looked at my sleeping HR. Mine is low when resting & really low when I’m asleep. This thread has reassured me a little that all is okay though. :). I do have a congenital heart condition, & I’m due to have an appt with my cardiologist in September (whether it’ll be face-to-face or over the phone, I’m not sure at the moment) so I’m going to ask then anyway just to make sure. Thanks for this thread & I hope everyone is healthy heart- & otherwise. 🙂
@Craig  Good advice. Often we accept a diagnosis from the doctor and then just sit back. We have to take a more active role in our own health because if we don't, no one else will do it for us. I'm sorry you're having to fight harder to regain your health, but if anyone can do it, it's you. You'll tackle that mountain one step at a time, while wearing your Fitbit to track those steps!

It seems absurd to pay for data that is collected on a device that has already been paid for, especially at $10 per month. What is so "premium" about sleep HR data that anyone would want to pay that much for? If the data is already collected, let us see it. I completely understand paying for "premium" services like coaching and workouts, but HR, come on. Please unlock this data for all. Also, providing tiers of premium at different prices would be nice too.
I had always wondered that. I once noticed that during my one night where I was not tired at all and was up all night laying in bed that it didn't change it's number until about 5 am when my watch thought I was sleeping. But I had noticed other times that whatever time I'd wakeup it would be showing  the -- no matter the time I wake. 3am, 4 am, 5 am, etc. So, I just wondered when it does it?
I don't have a fitbit myself yet, but I'm pretty sure I read a similar problem somewhere that was fixed by performing a reset... let me see if I can find it for you
@craigk4 thanks for the input! I was just curious as to how accurate they were, and I'll definitely wear it during my sleep study in 2 weeks. I'll keep you posted on the results and their comparison to the Fitbit Charge 2! I find it fascinating that these little devices can track things like our sleep and even when I'm napping during the day! One thing I've noticed is that it seems to recognize when I've been in more actual light and deep sleep - I tend to spend a lot of time in REM sleep (sometimes up to 50% of my sleep time) and when it says I've spent more time in light and deep sleep I tend to feel more rested. Very interesting. Love these things!
I never thought I got bad sleep until I monitored my sleep with fitbit!  I consistently get sleep efficiencies in the 50-60% range and have over two hours and between 10 and 15 wakeful periods a night.  On the other hand, when I use the "normal" setting, fitbit says I slept all night without waking up and I know that's not true either.  Suggestions?  Do I need to talk to my doctor about this?

New to fit bit....Why does my sleep page show last row only...  I really want to see if I ever enter REM stage...It just showed the last row. I forgot what it showed, it will take ne too long to verufy what it said...I think it showed no change...I am curious to see if I go into deep sleep or REM... I wake up exhausted until I force myself to move around...My job is cartio all day...i live in So. Fla taking care and servicing more than 17 commercial swimming pools 5 days a week...I am always rushing bending lifting netting and swet all day. Sleep Apnia runs in my family and I was told it is pretty bad some nites where I gasp for air and snore. Especially the days I stress...I want to track my sleep...2nd nite w/ fit bit 2
I would prefer if they made you do that to see the arbitrary sleep score and left the average hours as the first screen...
Have you heard anything more about this. I myself have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine at night but I still get the spiking into the cardio burning level. It doesn’t happen every night but it happens often enough for me to be curious about it. I will also be wearing an event monitor but not until July. It was found though that I do have an enlarged left atrium durian echocardiogram; but that is all I know right now. My PCP is also referring me to a cardiologist.
How was your sleep score this week?  😴
 
I love to see 100 score in the Fitbit app. But this is not what I usually get, I've noticed that I can do small changes in order to improve my sleep score. 
 

Avoid heavy and/or large meals within a couple hours of bedtime.
Take a hot bath or use relaxation techniques before bed.
Use the hour before bed for quiet time.
Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.

 

 
Do you have an specific strategy to improve your sleep score? 💤

I've been a pretty heavy Fitbit addict for a couple years now, but the Sleep Stages update a few weeks back has me to a point where I'm ready to throw it in a bin, and I'm really tired of getting given stock responses by Fitbit.  Firstly, the data is gives me doesn't really seem to make that much sense. It consistently registers a very low amount of deep sleep on my profile, and very high amounts of light sleep. I also see massive swings in sleep stage data from day to day. (I have a pretty routine lifestyle, low-ish alcohol consumption, go to bed similar times in week/weekend.) Every time I've asked Fitbit about this and the accuracy of sleep stages, I get diverted to the "what are sleep stages blog".  Also, the amount of time I am registered as "awake" each night has doubled from 30ish minutes to 1 hour. My monthly sleep average the last month has fallen by about 40 minutes from the last two years, from about 7 hours 15 mins, to 6 hours 30 minutes.   Fitbit is also registering 10-20 minute long "awake" spells that I have no recollection of being awake for.  I get that Fitbit isn't a medical grade device, etc. (Also when read about how sleep stages are actually monitored, it's hard to believe the accuracy of something that goes off so little.) But you'd hope at least the data would be accurate against itself.  It's created a bit of a negative feedback loop. I've  been contemplating turning off heart rate monitoring altogether, or trying a new tracker. Would love to hear any similar experiences, and I don't want someone to give me sleep advice, or send me to a sleep stages blog 😉
How long does it say you were in bed? My fitbit comes in/out of sleep mode sometime without me knowing.
I'm one of those people who fall asleep with the tv going.  I put something on and I can sleep.  I start with a book and I can get too much into it that hours pass.

Thank you for your comments, JonnyRow. Here are my observations:Sleep Stages: A "typical range" is provided, based on gender and age.Health Metrics: A "personal range" is provided.Sleeping Heart Rate: A "personal range" is provided.Restlessness: No range is provided, neither "personal" or "typical". Ideally, I think it would be more meaningful to have a "typical" range for all of the above, just like it is provided for the sleep stages. I wonder why it is not provided for the last 3 items? The data to do that must be the Fitbit system....... Thanks
Hello everyone,  I am new to this site and discussion group.  I am hoping to use my fitbit help me sleeptrack and gain information to help me sleep better.  I just used my fitbit one for the first time last night.  It was my first time ever using any gadget to sleeptrack.  I apologize if my question seems ridiculous, but am a techno-neophyte. On the dashboard I saw that the fitbit did track my sleep.   I also see:  "You have not logged any sleep."  and am told to "create a new sleep record" to show when I enter and leave my bed.Is there any advantage or reason to do this?  Does it help the tracker to be more accurate and know when activity begins and sleep ends?

I am having problems entering the sleep manually when I go to bed after midnight.  I have to change the date to today's date.  But then I get a message that the time is in the future and I am not allowed to enter my sleep.  Any suggestions?
Hi @Ace864  you're right about that. Getting enough sleep is important. I've noticed it when I don't feel well, too. @kinvon  the answer isn't always to use sleeping pills. Developing good sleep habits and keeping an eye on your health is best.

I have forgotten to 'wake' this morning.How do I change mt sleep record to show the real time I got up?
You just enter the times like normal and switch the default "previous day" to "same day". So you are saying you entered bed say 1 am and got up 7 am "same day".
Thank you for your response. So it sounds like I shouldn't consider thesleep results as being accurate. That's very disappointing. Thanks again.

Is there anyway to fix or alter that or receive the data of other shift workers to compare? I appreciate the information and advice you have shared. I will try to figure it out for more.
The tracker automagically tracks sleep when laying still for about a hour. When sitting and not moving much for a longer time (playing console games, sitting in a train, bus, reading a book..?).. it could then be detected as sleep while not sleeping..
I sometimes read before bed. But I'm also trying to get into the habit of doing some light yoga (in bed) before going to sleep. A few gentle twists, a minute or so in the bound angle pose (sit with the soles of your feet touching and the tips of your fingers touching the floor behind you), 30 seconds to a minute of child's pose, 30 seconds to a minute of a reclining goddess pose (lie on your back, pull your legs into a diamond shape, and put your arms over your head), at least a minute of corpse pose. If you have a tight groin, the reclining goddess pose will do wonders. I cobbled together a routine from a book called Yoga in Bed and a flipbook from 2005 called Yoga to the Rescue. Sometimes I'll do a bit of aromatherapy to help me.
Hi, I currently have an Inspire HR 1, use iPhone Fitbit app.  I recently purchased Fitbit premium.  
 
I wanted to look closely at my number of times awake in a night but I am unable to find it? In the past I thought this was provided? Can someone direct me to where?
 
I am looking for the total time count, not necessarily the graph where I have to count the times myself nor the total awake minutes. Thank you. 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Hi @Elkebelle Welcome to the forum. Your Versa should track all your sleep. However, it will not show up as separate events, it will be added to the total of sleep time. Please check to see if your overall sleep time increased (first sleep + second sleep) and let me know what you see. Good luck!

I have noticed this too.
Hey guys, I noticed my heartrate increased from 55 to 61.It has been around 55-56 for multiple weeks, and since last week it has been atleast 59-61 during nights which makes it a avarage of 61. Did my sleep changed? Or is it caused by a software update? With kind regards,rilapwn ps: had a little bit stress this week, but dont think it could influence my heartrate this much.
Hello @SGHinDC Welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thanks for sharing your experience. Deep sleep typically occurs in the first few hours of sleep. Also, note that if you haven't moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you're asleep. Probably this is happening when you're watching TV but your experience is really interested.  
 
See you around.

I have a charge hr and the sleep record on the 13th is correct, I did wakeup for about 45 minutes and back to sleep with getting up. On Sunday I gotout of bed after 6 but did not go back to bed but just watched TV sittingrelatively still. Generally it does seem to give errors is wake up times(broken lines) but often it is correct. Time to sleep is alos very goodsince most of the time I fall asleep quick. However, when I do wake up inthe middle of the night, I often do not tell the tracker I am going back tosleep so it could be my fault. I still think the Consumer Reports (CR), Feb2016 probably makes a good point for some people but the fitbit does notover estimate my sleep, and definitely not by 20%. However, the CR doeslike the heart rate and steps accuracy. All it all, the only complaint Ihave is sometimes getting sync in the morning. By the way I see that BlueCross is taking some interest in FITBIT readings and, at least in someplans you can sync your Fitbit readings to the Blue Cross health tools tocheck your individual health goals. Good idea, the health insurance plansshould have been doing this for some time.
It possibly could be that you might be bumping the button as you sleep and turning it off accidently.  I do that, on occasion, because I do so much tossing and turning.
Please Fitbit. I'm returning my flex I got as a gift and buying something else that will have the smart alarm. I like your interface but you need a smart alarm.
This happened to me sometimes. When I see bad dreams I ultimately wake up and can't sleep the rest of the night.
Hi Froggss, I'm not sure if you're around on this board anymore, but yes I see a huge difference. For example, I had a good size seizure yesterday afternoon, I have no memory of it and a hour or more afterwards. However, then last night I slept 47% of my night between deep and rem which is unheard of for me, the most I ever get between the two is somewhere between 12 and 25% a night. Nights that I have nocturnal seizures you will see numerous pink lines all over the chart that given night, not thick ones very faint ones. If it is a larger seizure in my sleep you will see on the heart rate graph that it looks like I worked out doing cardio. ( it's odd but it always makes me laugh). But we have to deal with in our lives you just have to laugh sometimes. 🙄
@WMarc I'm not sure whether there is a correlation between your sleep cycle and the 11 minute increment of restless time, or if there is something strange going on with your tracker.
 
The Fitbit Support team can definitely look into this on the back end, though...so I'd encourage you to reach out to them if you're skeptical. 
 
Thanks!

The graph should be fairly low on the scale and hopefully fully green.With my readings I see this quite a bit, but occasionally see some spikes with the yellow peaks.  One thing I am noting is that when I see this my heart rate has dropped too low.
Looking for answers to the same question.
For development team Suggest new Sleep graphs from the Fitbit app by improving it with the ability in editing sleep bits when the Flex accidentally has being tapped into the Sleep mode or forget to turn off in the morning until later. Thanks
Just wondering if my numbers for restless sleep could be higher since my husband is also a restless sleeper? Could the fit bit also be picking up his restlessness since we tend to cuddle?  Thanks!
Hi, @Carogilf! I know this doesn't fix the underlying issue of Fitbit not auto recognizing your sleep, but I would suggest going in and editing the sleep record to match your schedule, especially since it sounds like you're pretty consistent. Getting up briefly shouldn't impact your record, but if you're tossing and turning all night, it may be that Fitbit just isn't recognizing it.

Last night I recorded my sleep.  I was just looking at it, and there was an option to 'move to activity log', so I clicked that, ...and now I can't find last night's sleep history anywhere?  Can I get it back?
it is not stress, it is a fitbit bug. you can see that by going to edit the sleep log and adding a couple of minutes when you know you were awake. the heartbeat "rate" will shift up even though you didn't sleep longer.they can tell when you sleep and when you're awake, and they could filter out the awake time but they're lazy. people use their app whether it is good or just okay, so why bother. Terrible quality control.
I hate it! I have narcolepsy, and my sleep cycles are not at all what the algorithm "thinks" it should be! I wish I could switch it back!

I've found that the software flux helps me with this, too:https://justgetflux.com/ It filters your screen to match the time of day in your time zone. It's awesome. 🙂
I just read that it's an android update issue and several people are seeing the same with version 3.64. I'm still following up as I do have other sleep apnea symptoms.
I've had the Fitbit for about two weeks now and so far, I really like it. I've read some of the postings with relation to sleep patterns and how accurate it tends to be. I'd like to share that what I've noticed is that is does seem pretty accurate to me. I sometimes use a CPAP machine - I've tested with and without, and found that both results seemed pretty accurate. My main question is - How tight or lose does the device have to be worn? I do wear it on my right (non-dominant) hand, and it's not really snug, but tight enough. I'd love some insight on other experiences please.
I'm confused. The thread that you linked to has only a vague description of a problem so I'm not sure if it's the same thing that I'm seeing. It also says that the problem was fixed on Wednesday and is fixed by an update. I have an iPhone, and there is no available update for the fitbit app. In that thread there is a link to a procedure to getting the fitbit app version info under iOS. It refers to clicking on things that are nowhere to be found in my fitbit app.
I've been in your situation for possibly a year, can't remember any dreams, etc. Until last April when I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and prescribed an automatic CPAP machine.  First week or 2 I would vividly remember 2-3 dreams every night, waking up briefly after each one and remembering details of them. (Oddly I've seen one of the "side effects" of CPAP is listed as Excessive Dreaming, such an odd way to put it) Since then (it's been 6 weeks or so), I remember maybe 1 dream a night, possibly b/c I'm not waking up after the dreams anymore.  I think that is the key.  My fitbit is brand new (bought a Charge 3 yesterday) so last night's my only reference, but it showed 3 separate sessions at times that look similar to what I recall during the early days of my CPAP therapy, when I would briefly wake up after a dream and glance at the clock.  So they're happening just I'm not waking up enough to remember them.

Don't you get a screen like this when you tap on the individual day?  Your sleep score is based on 100 points: 50 points for time asleep, 25 for Deep and REM, and 25 for Restoration.If you want to read more, see What's sleep score in the Fitbit app? 

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I set my fitbit one and turned it off when I awoke.  The data didn't register on my sleep log.  Is there anyway to retreive the information?
Hello Everyone! I just purchased my fitbit yesterday and last night i tested out the sleep tracker. I am so shocked to see how much sleep i loose. I am seeking advice on how to get my sleep on track. I would post a screen shot of my sleep tracker but i am still not sure how to upload it to my post but it says i only got 3 hours and 45 mins of sleep.

Yeah, but I mean, it's annyoing because in all of the other aspects, I'm satisfied with Fitbit. Before, I used Sleep Cycle on my iPhone but I thought that the wristband could replace all of the functionality without having to plug in my phone and position it under my pillow every day before going to sleep. I thought Fitbit would integrate this functionality but it's been a while now and nothing happened 😞
Let me start with a question. Apple or Android? what do I mean by this? We all know by now how phones and tablets affect us in our daily lives. For the past month I began taking a few hrs to read articles about health and specially better eating. I notice when I do not do this I sleep less hrs. sometimes from 4.30 to 5.30 Hrs I feel I can work and operate regular but the biggest changes happen when I sleep 7 hr. no more than this otherwise I feel tired and liturgic. How many of you have this same experience or think can function just perfectly fine with 5 hrs?now days I think 6 to 7 hrs are just right. Let me know what you do to sleep better?My best companion to achieve this my trusty Charge 3 with the oxygen really helps with my snoring
Do some research into sleep cycles. We all cycle through different phases of sleep over and over all night. A cycle is about 90 minutes long and during that time we go from lightly asleep through REM (dreaming) into deep restorative sleep and back. It makes sense that at the lighter point in your cycle you would move a bit more as you are not as deeply asleep. As long as you are getting enough sleep (7-9 hours is considered ideal) and you feel like you are getting enough sleep I would assume this is normal for you.
The average person sleeps about seven hours a night around the age of 40, and about six and a half hours a night between the ages of 55 and 60. A healthy 80-year-old will usually sleep about six hours a night. But these are all only averages: everyone needs a different amount of sleep.You can read hindi health point for more info
i do relaxation 30 min yoga in the evening sometimes and honestly sleep much better those days
Hey there! I'd like to add something else to @Rich_Laue's excellent information.
 
Keep in mind that having an HR based tracker does have an impact on your sleep logs. Having your settings on "sensitive" or "normal" plays a big part on checking your restlessness. But there are some cases where your sleep may not be accurately logged with an HR based tracker. This can be for different reasons, one of them a high resting heart rate or trying to rest after an intense workout or a stressful situation, since it will take longer for your body to 'wind down' and recognize a sleeping pattern. 
 
I've been on that road; while I don't get to sleep much, on top of that my sleep is also affected by the state of mind I'm in before jumping in bed. 
 

Here are some tips that may help improve the quality of your sleep.

Just bought a new fitbit flex and thought that I had followed the instructions for logging my sleep. However there is no sleep log this mornng when I sync. Any advice help?
I have a Fitbit flex 2 and mine does that every night as well. I have tried to reset my Fitbit, but it continues to wake me up in the middle of the night, every night. I have held up with this for over 5 months and I can't figure out how to stop it except for wait for the vibrations to stop. I have checked that I have no silent alarms and everything seems normal. It makes me very annoyed. What is the problem? Thank you.
Like you my heart rate is much higher than my RHR at bedtime and by 4am my SHR starts to dip below my RHR.  If I'm lucky my SHR is lower than my RHR 40% of the night but usually a lot less.  My heart rate stays very low all morning after I wake up even if I am active.  Perhaps this has something to do with sleep chronotypes, different circadian rhythms?
Hi @RockinRach  you need a compatible smartphone or tablet with the Fitbit app in order to join the community groups, join challenges and interact more closely with friends. You can't do it from the website.

Hi all, first sorry so I’m sorry if this is in the wrong place. It’s under the sleep section so I guess it’s right! I’ve only just happened to notice this oxygen variation bit on my Fitbit app and I’ve read up a little bit to understand it a bit better just I’m just wondering what would be considered ‘normal’ oxygen variation. Mine stays in the ‘low’ part the entire time and only fluctuates slightly in the low part, it never goes into the high bit. Is this normal?

A score in fitness is understandable. How far did you run? How many steps did you take? How quickly did you cycle? But sleep is completely different. Sleep is sooo complex. You get a score but so what? What does the score mean on any one particular night? Did you have more deep sleep? More REM? Did you sleep longer? Wake less? And the thing is none of those are changeable through any act of will. Yes, you can choose to go to bed earlier but will you sleep any better. You could choose to build your sleep pressure by going to bed later but is that what impacted your sleep on that particular night. ANY sleep specialist will tell you that one of the greatest enemies of sleep is anxiety about sleep - and to be given a SCORE on your sleep is not helpful at all. Anxiety is reduced through a sense of control and predictability and accomplishment. The score does nothing other than, as one poster said early, provide judgement and judgement over something over which you have so little control. Some people sleep terribly despite doing all the the right things. Fitbit needs to recognize that sleep is completely different than every other aspect of fitness. Please, please, please get rid of the curse of the sleep score!!!

Do you take calcium/magnesium before bed or?  I don't have trouble falling asleep just staying asleep.  fitbit shows very restless sleep patterns and waking every 30 min to every hour.
Aw, don't freak out @SarahLucy145, things will be alright. I'm glad you have an appointment with a doctor, who's advice will be far better than anything I could say. As to your question about resting heart rate, it's difficult to say. Could you post a screenshot of a 24 hour period, so we can see the high and low periods?

@ScottSmith @Purpletiki Did your devices track last night? I rebooted mine yesterday afternoon and it tracked last night. Not sure it's 100% a fix but it worked for me. If you need to reboot, scroll up to Settings, then the option 2nd from the bottom is to reboot device. You'll have to hold the screen for a few seconds while a white box draws around the screen. Then you'll see a smiley face.
You're right, I should have elaborated on the 'why'. I'm analyzing and trying to find relations in my own 266 days of Fitbit data.Resting heart-rate and the efficiency score pulled from the API correlate strongly. What I need to know is: is the efficiency score (pulled from API) calculated using the resting heart-rate? Or is it calculated using the formula from the thread in 2014? Because if it is, then the conclusion taken from the correlation significantly changes. Thank you.
Just got premium with the restlessness percentage...and I've seen answers on how it's calculated but like what should your percentage actually be? What are people's average percentage? How does this percentage help us if we don't have any actual parameters for it? (I feel like this is a usual problem with the feedback fitbit gives you)
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Ambidextrous or not, the problem is that fitbit (most likely in an effort to simplify) named the setting wrong. 🙂 What the setting does is set the sensitivity of the fitbit. non-dominant sets the sensitivity higher and dominant sets it lower. So for me, a rightie who wears the fitbit on the left but apprently moves his hands a lot when talking or sitting or pretty much doing anything that's not walking the dominant setting (ie lower sensitivty) works best. It still overestimates my steps by about 2000 a day though...
Hi @Josh.F It looks like you didn't get an answer to your question. I can offer you this from research (that seems to indicate the effect on REM sleep doesn't go away)"Antidepressants may aid depressed individuals in treating their insomnia, however they tend to affect sleep architecture as well. Specifically, SSRIs, are known to inhibit REM sleep. This class of antidepressant works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin in the synapse, thus increasing the amount of serotonin available to bind to the postsynaptic cell. Those wi"th depression have lower than normal levels of serotonin, which is ameliorated by SSRIs. Specifically in regards to sleep architecture, serotonergic activity is almost silent during REM sleep (Drago, 2008). Thus, SSRIs increasing of serotonin in the synaptic cleft would suppress REM sleep by increasing the amount of Non-REM via serotonin activity."

Agreed the sleep score is just a gimmick. It needs removing or making an option. You can still see your average hours in the app. Click on the little graph at the top and go to the fourth page. The averages are still there, just not as convenient to view as they once were
Hi all, as I'm sure everyone knows by now, the general rule of thumb to having a great rest is waking up at the end of 1.5 hour increments since that's typically how long REM cycles last (e.g. you feel refreshed after sleeping for 6 hours or 7.5 hours vs. 6.5 or 8 hours). Correct me if this premise is wrong. So my question is, my fitbit shows that I am awake for around 1 hour every day. So if I go to bed by 11PM and wake up at 6:30AM, it shows that while I was "asleep" for 7.5 hours, I was only sleeping for 6.5 hours. Meaning I didn't take advantage of the sleep cycles. In this case, now that I know I am always "awake" for 1 hour, I should aim to sleep for 8.5 hours, but in reality I would be sleeping for the perfect 7.5 hours?Did this make any sense...haha. Thanks all in advance!
Hi Gullly58 Chelated Magnesium Glycinate - I take 400 mg in the morning and 200 mg at night.  It really works for me. Lynn
There are external factors than effect sleep. Like spending too much time on phones, tablets or computers for example. You can do some simple things that may help your sleep quality. I would check Shawn Stevenson on YouTube. He also has a great book you could use for reference.
I am having the same issue, I had a sleep score a few weeks ago and after an update it seems to have disappeared. I paid money for something that is not working.  I have hard reset my Versa 2 and logged out off the app still nothing. I am a Samsung user. Thanks GG2

Thank you!  Somehow the "heart rate" button got turned off. Maybe when I had to restart it. Still having syncing issues though. 😕
Thank you for your help.
I have a similar problem.  The top of the screen shows 'hours spent in sleep stages' and the different colours are there for REM light etc.  but everything is in No stages'' and I have had the update for around two weeks.  Is there a problem with the blaze update?
I had a heart attack following a stroke.  Unfortunately I live in Missouri and finding a good cardiologist is next to impossible.  After a triple bypass surgery I was having a problem with fluid retention in my legs.  (turned out to be medication enduced).  A drug called Furosemide will help clear it up, but the side effects are that it WILL not may destroy organs.The first cardiologist I was to see was going to have me check into the hospital thru the ER and be put on massive antibiotics for an infection in my legs which I did not have.  I walked out.Later I saw another cardiologist from a different hospital.  By that time I was back to walking 45 minutes every day and doing 15 minutes of light to moderate cario exercise.  This doctor did not listen to anything I said.  Eight weeks following surgery and she was telling me I should be briskly walking 10,000 steps a day.  Even my wife, who dosen't think any doctor can do wrong, commented that she was very condescending.  Unfortunately I have not actually seen a cardiologist that I trust and can work with.Using fitbit I closely watch my heart rate while exercising and try to keep from going past cardio.  I am currently doing about 30-50 minutes of cardio daily plus walking 45 minutes.
Hello @deltonabill. Welcome to the community forums. 
 
Thank you for the detailed information. Regarding your question, I'd like to let you know that the benchmark in the Fitbit App is based on published data and shows how your sleep stage estimates from the previous night compare to the averages of others who are the same age range and sex (source). In the graph, the typical range for each sleep stage is shown as the shaded area between the two horizontal lines. Keep in mind sleep cycles vary naturally, and you’ll likely see your sleep data fall outside the typical ranges at times. Another way to analyze your sleep stages is to compare your data from last night to your own 30 day average (under the 30 Day Avg tab), as your sleep patterns may vary over time. 
 
Also, take into consideration that the first phase of REM sleep typically occurs after you’ve had an initial stage of deep sleep. You generally stay in REM sleep for a longer period of time during sleep cycles occurring in the second half of the night. During this final stage of sleep, your brain becomes more active. Dreams mainly occur during REM sleep, and your eyes move quickly in different directions. Heart rate increases and breathing becomes more irregular. In principle, muscles below the neck are inactive to avoid acting out dreams.
 
For more information on sleep stages, see our blog posts REM, Light, Deep: How Much of Each Stage of Sleep Are You Getting? and Your Heart Rate Is the Key to Smarter Sleep Stages. Here’s Why. For additional sleep information including tips for feeling rested, visit the Fitbit blog.
 
At this time, this is the only available information for Sleep Stages. 
 
Hope this helps.

UPDATE: It tracked last night. I had rebooted it during the day so if yours is still not tracking, it might be worth it to try. If you need to reboot, scroll up to Settings, then the option 2nd from the bottom is to reboot device. You'll have to hold the screen for a few seconds while a white box draws around the screen. Then you'll see a smiley face.
I have been a Fitbit user for several years. I had the original flex and now I have had the surge for over a year. I am concerned about my sleep patterns because of a chronic pain condition and I’m wanting to know how accurate the sleep tracker actually is on the Fitbit. I know that Fitbit has a disclaimer that it’s not a medical device but I want to try to track my sleep as accurately as possible. And if it is accurate, I am scared for my sleep. I will be in bed for 8-9 hours and only be in deep sleep for 2-5 at most. This has been over the course of years not just a few nights. I’ve talked to doctors but they said I’m still technically getting sleep. Obviously I don’t feel restful but I wanted to ask the community their feelings of this. I also have it set on my non-dominant wrist on the sensitive setting. I want it to be accurate. I also sleep with someone else in bed with me. Advice is greatly appreciated.
Did you try restarting your fitbit?  It often helps if it's the fitbit at fault.   But also to add:  I find that when I don't sleep continuously though the night, it doesn't give me the stages (REM, Deep/light sleep), but gives me the older way (restless/awake).  So I don't know if it's me.. since my sleep patterns fluctuate so often, not sure if this was helpful for you.
Hello!So I'm tired a lot....I have Bradycardia (a very low resting heart rate) and also Polycystic ovaries. My fitbit Charge HR is set to normal. My sleep efficiency is anywhere from 25%-35% on average every night. I get between 2-4 hours sleep (4 hours seems to be the max). I don't snore (so don't think it's sleep apnea) but I have woken myself on the odd occasion with a loud snort!  Any thoughts? I'd really appreciate hearing other people's experiences...Thanks.
Hi all, Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during this time! I'm interested to know people's sleep experiences when they started taking SSRIs.  I've been taking Lexapro (Escitolopram) for just over a week now and I have noticed a significant drop in my REM sleep on most nights. Have other people experienced this? If so, did this subside once the drug stablised within your body? The doctor said symptoms tend to be more severe in the first two weeks. I understand SSRIs do act as a REM sleep suppressant, but interested to hear others experiences. Thankfully my sleep scores are still averaging 83 or so, but still would like more REM haha! Thanks all Josh
Are you female? I have the same problem and the only theory I am left with after desparately trying to find answers is that it could be a hormonal imbalance. One of the reasons I say this is that I'm also always too hot at night (but not menopausal...!) and my nighttime heart rate fluctuates with my monthly cycle consistently.
There is a product coming out called Sense.  It sits on your bedstand and has a pill that attaches to your pillow.  It records everything about your nights sleep such as inside influences, outside influences.  But not only that, it provides recomendation for what needs to be adjusted in your room for a better nights sleep.  For example it may sense your room is too bright.  Or if you wake up at 4AM and you listen to the sound log you may find that at 3:45 some butthole always drives down your road on a loud motorcycle.  Anyway it does more than just track, it recommends improvements. It is still in development so Google : Sense Kickstarter and you can contribute to the project and get the device for the same price as the FItbit.  Maybe it can help you find the issue.
Small handful of 80s, mostly 60s...my Fitbit usually cuts off my first sleep cycle and that drops everything a lot.
It is normal unless it skyrockets past your personal normal. You also want to look at your average resting heart rate - not individual points of time unless you are worried about arrhythmia or other heart concerns.

I've recently bought a Charge 2 and I'm finding the sleep graphs really confusing. It breaks my night up into little chunks and there are gaps in the recording. Last night I was in bed by 11ish and up at about 7.30 yet it's saying I only had around 3 hours sleep! Can anyone explain? Below are screenshots from the app and also the online dashboard.
On the sleep tracker there are two charts, one is normal, and there is another cant think of the name. Are they the same as such or is one (the one I cant name lol) more detailed??My sleep tracker shows what I thought, that I only sleep for 3 1/2 - 4 hours a night.Is there a difference between the 2 charts??Thanks
Thanks. I'm trying it now! 🙂
@1970GenX You can't edit the "Jogger" title.  It is just a title that is automatically assigned to you based on how many posts you have on the Fitbit forums.  It doesn't actually mean you are a jogger.

Is it normal to go from awake to deep sleep? Would be greatly for any insight.
you can change the brightness of your tracker in the app to dim. There is not a feature currently that has adaptation like your cell phone when it is in sunlight or dim lighting

It’s jsur happened to me for the first time on my charge 2 I have 100% battery and had manually restarted it whilst it was charging before I went to bed. As I was getting simplified results due to why I believe was low battery or not enough sleep. However I know what time I was in bed by and what time I woke up had there is no data for last night whatsoever.
My flex and my wife's one have been recording 100% efficiency since Sep 5.  Seems a software update on Sep 4 must have affected the calculation of actual sleep time.  If I delete the sleep log on the computer and relog it with the exact times, the calculation is correct.  Hope someone from fitbit reads these logs since I couldn't find a way to tell them directly.
Hi @SGHinDC If you look in the app, under Benchmark, it will show you the average sleep stages. The amount really depends on your age. For me, about 90 minutes deep and 2-2.5 hours of REM seems to be fine.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
For a sleep score three hours of sleep and a consistant heart rate is needed.
Which sleep sensitivity setting are you using: normal (which is the default) or sensitive? 450 steps sound like a lot of hand moves. I’m in the opposite situation: I don’t get any steps during the night, even though I know for a fact I’m taking trips (from 1 to 3) to the bathroom. They show up as spikes on my HR graph, but don’t register as steps. Apparently, the trip is so short it doesn’t exceed the threshold for consecutive steps before steps are registered.

Since this post, I've tried restarting the device and then switching the sensitivity setting to "sensitive". That seems to have helped greatly, and now I am getting far more sleep scores.
My fit bit is doing the same thing. I wear it nightly but do not get a score. Mine is also not tracking my exercise daily and I do water aerobics daily. Some days it will track and other days it won’t.
My deep sleep averages 40 min according to Fitbit. it goes as low as 6 min, the clinical study was 101 min.I often lie in bed in the morning listening to the radio and even though I know what is being said my Fitbit claims I was asleep. Go figure.
My Doc said I didn't have sleep apnea but told him I wanted to have a sleep test.  Sure enough I have it and am on a CPAP machine for over a year now and am never tired since I am now getting a good nights sleep and it registers at about 95%.  So I suggest getting into a sleep clinic and get it checked out.
Thanks for the response. I understand that the devices aren't specifically designed for my purpose. But in all my searching, there doesn't appear to be much else that I'm finding that's better suited. The FitBit devices tend to be recommended by a lot of articles about sleep tracking. So just some specific questions that are not 100% clear from the Help page if that's OK: - Are you able to see specific times where your heart rate changes (e.g., elevated at 4:30am, back to normal 4:50am)? - Has anyone experienced them tracking you as awake if your wrist/arm is moving? Wondering if I could purposely do that every now & then if awake to make the device track as awake? - Can you edit the data and/or make notes later on? Thanks. I'm still looking if anyone else has more specific insight. I sleep with white noise, so anything that tracks by sound probably wouldn't work for me. Thanks again!
Me too.  I often go in and manually edit beginning sleep time.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I'm not sure if the Alta will make a more "complete" graph than your Flex 2. My mom got the Alta and it appears pretty much the same.. as far as I know, sleep stages will be shown only if you have an Alta HR, a Charge 2 or a Blaze. Again as far as I know, the Sleep Sensitivity it's not about having a more (or less) accurate report.. it's more about "finding the right setting for you".. it might be that during the night you move a lot and the sensitive setting is picking it up as if you were awake/restless when, instead, you were sleeping.The normal setting will still show you the awake/restless times and, in my mom's case, we believe it's more accurate for her.

Hello @momo43 ,We are still waiting to hear from you. I hope they can find an answer for your problem.Be aware that heart rate diseases are more difficult to find with women. You can check the literature for that. A monitor will not always give you the results.

Hi Linda,No solution to my knowledge. Mine did come to life again of its own accord but it's still not reliable now.
Hi everyone, I seem to have opposite problem to most. I seem never to have grown out of the teenager "I can sleep for 12hours easily" thing. I'm 32 this year! My fitbit reflects this - sometimes I struggle to get to sleep but when I do, I don't wake AT ALL until my alarm goes.  It's HELL to get out of bed as well, even after 9-10 hours, to go to work. At weekends I can sleep 12-14hours, almost all day if I'm hungover!!  I've got a sunrise alarm clock, a nice wake up tune and a vibration from my fitbit and it's still HELL! I've tested my fitbit on my parents - they wake 4-5 times a night so I believe it's recording accurately.Is there something wrong with me?! If I don't wake up at all then does that mean I'm NOT lazy?  I don't have a hard physical job or anything.  I am on antidepressants tho.  (Citalapram). Any suggestions welcome!

Maybe you are right, if I slept longer then I still could have gotten the same sleep score. I am sure that if you contact Fitbit they can give you a breakdown of how it works! keep me in the loop because I am curious to hear what they have to say
@Aurora17 and @Itw It looks like @Rich_Laue has got the right idea, the thin red marks as I understand it are the minute times that you were either awake/restless for such a short period you may have not noticed it, so it is periods of time that you are not in any of the other 3 stages (on the mobile app if you tap on the main graph you can then swipe through each stage with a bit more of an explanation

I don't binge on coffee or sugar (drink decafe), but it is good that you know why you don't get much sleep. I also have had my bloodwork done (every year) and all is good. I do not nap; don't feel that need to rest during the day as I am not tired. All I am saying is if you feel tired, rundown, etc., see a doctor. Otherwise, some people need to function on more sleep than others.
HiIf there are regular oxygen level variation what does it imply?
I had this issue and had a sleep study back last September. I found out I wake up around 80 times an hour and never reach REM sleep. I got a cpap back then and have used it everyday since. I show almost no restless on my fitbit. For me, it made a dramatic difference in my life. Also previous to this I had tried melatonin and various prescriptions. I now am off prescriptions and sleep well
When Fitbit did their last update on my watch, it all works now. Why dothey not post when they plan to do an update? Grrrr. Had me fuming forweeks.
I find the sleep function to be very accurate. It shows when I'm restless and my partner corroborates the times sometimes!Do you have it set to sensitive, rather than normal? Or have a partner/pet that moves around a lot while you sleep? Maybe you're just a fidgety sleeper!
Mine also does the same thing but I don't know why.

Over the last four days, my 'Deep and REM' score out of 25 (one of the components of the total sleep score) has been behaving very strangely:  Day 1: Score 21/25 from 47 mins Deep and 19% REM. Day 2: Score 19/25 from 1hr 38 mins Deep and 14% REM. Day 3: Score 18/25 from 1hr 19 mins Deep and 34% REM.Day 4: Score 20/25 from 30 mins Deep and 27% REM.  How can Day 3 be scoring lower than Days 1 and 4, with much more Deep sleep and REM also higher???? The only explanation can be that the system penalises too much Deep sleep, or maybe places some value on Light sleep? Grateful if Fitbit can clarify? Thanks,  Strahan

All you are doing when you set the timer and don't wear it Fitbit it gives you your BMR. When you set the sleep timer and wear the Fitbit it waits for a predetermined amount of no activity and assumes you are asleep and then records the movements. This feature has confused others over the last few years because they set the timer to measure an activity, have a period of non activity and when they turn the timer off there is no log in the activities. It has gone into the Sleep area and that is why we can reverse a sleep record to an activity record. Hope this helps and maybe you are having blissful sleep. You can edit the sleep record and change it from Normal to Sensitive after you have recorded sleep and analyse the sleep period. It does not affect future sleep records.

I downloaded the app, I've heard many good things about it but has anyone who has used it, does your sleep improved within the 6 weeks ? or do you happen to find something that works better 
 
Moderator Edit: Clarified subject
I've been wearing my Inspire 2 every night for over a week, and it still says "No Data" (Yes, I signed up for so-called "premium").There are other features that don't seem to be doing anything either, but I don't even care about most of that. I had an old school fitbit that I loved, and my husband got this one for me, thinking I would like it. Nothing seems to be working on it (other than steps), and I am tired of being furious with it every time I look at my wrist.If I hadn't had the old school, easy fitbit, I don't think I would be hating this one so much.
Last week I had two very poor nights sleep, like 3% deep sleep, yet my sleep score was 86. And I felt unrested. So I know now that the numbers are truly incorrect & not scientifically anything.Please provide a disable option!!!
My alta hr is showing that I spent only 28 minutes in deep sleep while I slept for 7.45 hours.Why did I had only 28 minutes of deep sleep?How can I improve my deep sleep time?
@MikeN. wrote:I’m only getting basic sleep stages with my Fitbit Versa, I’ve had full sleep stage data with how I wear it, so I know it’s not the fit. I’ve checked for an update, and I’m not seeing one. I got my Versa for Christmas and I’ve been seeing full sleep stages since I’ve been wearing it, but the last 2 nights just basic stages. Is anyone else having this problem? Mine started on the nights 1/11/19 and 1/12/19.I wouldn't expect too much from Fitbit by way of a response on this. There is something seriously wrong with the way they process the sleep data and it has been pointed out in numerous posts but nothing seems to be being done to even acknowledge there’s a problem or start a dialogue with the user base to establish determine the root cause and solve it. However, communication is also a problem with them. In the meantime, get some dice they would probably do a better job.
Mine is usually right on---BUT--las night I was in bed, and hubby started snoring (he does not do to this very often) and getting to the point, I did NOT get to sleep until maybe 6:30 in the morning! Slept  only 4 and a half hours (what I say), but Fit Bit HR said I went to bed and slept 1 hour and 53 minutes the first time----and then 6:15 A.M. I went to sleep and slept for over 5 hours (almost 6). What's up with that?

I am not too happy with the way Fitbit Flex keeps track of my sleep. Most times it shows 97 % sleep quality when it took 1 hour to get to sleep and wake up or restless 14 times. Most total hours is 5 1/2. This is not a good nights sleep. Whoever made these stats needs to look up the quality of sleep. I thought 8 hours is a good nights sleep. Seems like any sleep is good acording to Fitbit.   Please respond and explain why they cannot give a more accurate result that will tell you that being restless 15 or 20 times a night is NOT a good nights sleep and the efficientcy should be lower and telling you to get better sleep.Thank you
I generally don't get the recommend 6-8 hours of rest. I typically wake up 2 to 3 times during the course of a night. And my sleep is inconsistent. Good sleep one night followed by bad the next, over and over (here's what it looks like). https://andrewdigenova.com/sleep/sleep.jpg. As you can see by the graph, I seem to get one good night's sleep followed bad the next. If I get a good night's sleep on a Saturday night, I can pretty much count on Sunday night's sleep being bad. Looks like a kind of saw tooth pattern on the Fitbit graph. It drives me nuts. I'd really like to know why the alternating pattern. There must be a reason, right?I have pretty good sleep hygiene. Cutting down on LED light. Pretty consistent sleep start times and pre-bed routine. I get in a lot of walking daily. From 10K to 18K steps. I get solid exercise during the weekends playing tennis and jogging. That seems to help some with my sleep a bit. But there is no direct one to one correlation between intense workouts and good sleep. My eating habits are very good. Lots of green vegetables, healthy bowls, green smoothies and green juices. Anyone have ideas why my sleep looks the way it does? Anyone else experience this pattern?
Hi @ECP123 - You may want to try the Relax app. It relies strictly on vibration. When I use this, I close my eyes and let my breathing follow the vibrations. Relax can be set for 2 minutes or higher. When I studied meditations, we learned to do it without music so this suits me well. I use it daily.
Hi @katstoudt, Welcome. Many people use the sleep tracking to help them keep tabs on their nighttime health. There's a lot of interest in how Fitbit might be used to help identify sleep apnea.Here's some more information on sleep stages:https://blog.fitbit.com/sleep-stages-and-sleep-insights-announcement/ Also, I hope you are following doctor's recommendations in regards to the CPAP. For some people, that machine is critical. Obviously, I don't know your situation, but felt I should say that.

Hi all, I will preface this by saying I wear a Charge 2! I have recently noticed that I get pretty low amounts of deep sleep on a regular night (anywhere from 9-15%). I am not sure why this is the case, but somehow I get much higher amounts of deep sleep after a night out drinking. For instance, 28% deep sleep versus my normal 12%. Why could this be the case? I thought your sleep was worse after drinking, so I'm very confused why my sleep tracking says I'm getting much more deep sleep!  Also, does anyone have any idea what could cause such low deep sleep in the first place? Could it be due to medications? Thanks, caroline
@HelenaFitbit- Also, my fitbit is on normal setting. Not sensitive. Which was slightly alarming I guess. No TV/ other electronics before bed. No caffeine, etc.
Thanks Steve good read!
So you see if you are truly getting a good night's sleep. It's amazing how restless sleep can be. If you see you aren't sleeping soundly, you can make changes. My doctor suggested I track my sleep. Studies show that lack of sleep takes years off your life.

I have had a sleep study and I have mild sleep apnea ( not enough to justify a cpap).  However, when I changed the fitbit sleep to sensitive I went from averaging 7 hrs sleep at 92% efficiency to just over 4 hrs at 50% efficiency!  (As you, hours of reslessness).   I have restless legs and primary limb movement during the nite.  I'm thinking (hoping) that since the fitbit measures movement, this sensitivity setting means nothing for somone who moves alot during sleep, but is still asleep. I'm going to move my fitbit back to nomral 🙂  I don't need anything else to worry about.
@chris_in_cal  I don't think this is related to heart rate at all (otherwise it would be mistaking all of your asleep time for awake time or something like that, rather than being able to give you your sleep stages).  I think this is a problem with the app.  I had some number of months where the thing worked properly, but it has been doing this new thing off and on since December.  I believe one of the updates messed it up.
How to Sleep Better   Why Does the Sound of Water Help You Sleep? The crash of ocean waves, the babbling of brooks, the pitter-patter of rain on shingles — many people swear by these watery sounds to help them fall asleep and stay in la-la land. Why does flowing "agua" apparently have such a powerful and popular drowsing effect?Part of the answer lies in how our brains interpret the noises we hear — both while awake and in the dead of night — as either threats or non-threats.Certain sounds, such as screams and loud alarm clocks, can hardly be ignored. Yet other sounds, like the wind in the trees and waves lapping ashore, we sort of tune out. [Ocean Sounds: The 8 Weirdest Noises of the Antarctic]"These slow, whooshing noises are the sounds of non-threats, which is why they work to calm people," said Orfeu Buxton, an associate professor of biobehavioral health at Pennsylvania State University. "It's like they're saying: 'Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.'" You can listen to rain sound in this YouTube channel:  www.youtube.com/rainsounds
These are some things that help me to sleep: Don't answer the telephone after 7:00 p.m..Don't exercise after 7:00 p.m. Read for an hour or so before turming out the lightNo eating after dinner and no alcohol at allNo computer work after dinner - reading from my iPad doesn't seem to affect me though
Thanks for the insight, that helps and makes sense. My app subtracts awake time. I went to bed at 9:56pm, woke up at 3:40am and had 35 min awake time. The Fitbit app recorded my sleep as 5hr, 9 min. Is that a setting I can change? I’ve changed my daily sleep goal to 6hr 15 min. Figure about 15% awake time so that will put me around 7 hrs total time in bed.
The tracker is always active and you can create manual sleep records like you have done. It is only a copy of the tracker data. Keep that in mind because I rarely use the sleep band and always manually log my sleep so that I have an accurate sedentary time for my other calculations.

Hi @Naz00 THIS article does a great job of explaining  sleep scores. I hope that helps.

The point is its a random score and I am scoring fair with 10 minutes of REM in a night, no explination as to how its worked out means we have no way of knowing what it means. My 'sleep guru' is the worlds leading sleep scientist... as I have suffered from insomnia in the past I know a lot about sleep. It is important to get REM, of a certain amount or you wont feel refreshed. 'Light sleep' has certain benifits. Its great that it seems to work for you but I've been told my sleep was good after waking up exausted and not feeling refreshed, which by the way is directly related to a good nights sleep..
There's a lot of troubleshooting and issues threads so just trying to change it up. My best has been 90 which I've got three times since I started using my Sense just over two months ago.
Since childhood every once in a while I will remember waking up gasping for air or mid-gasp, and I've been experiencing other symptoms of sleep apnea (sore/dry throat in the morning, daytime drowsiness, and loud snoring which also sometimes wakes me up). Recently I've been experiencing the mid-sleep episodes of gasping more frequently. Which prompted me to get another Fitbit to see if I could catch it on the spO2 chart.My third night with it, I experienced a mid-gasp episode right at the beginning of the night, which corresponds to the high spikes on the chart in the picture. Otherwise my variance charts seem to bounce up and down below or just above the high line, with a common average spO2 being 95%.Prior I did make an appointment with my primary care Dr. which I had yesterday (event happened night before), to discuss my symptoms. He did order a sleep study based on symptoms alone (I didn't have to show off my Fitbit data).Given my situation am I crazy for actually looking forward to the sleep study just so I can have some answers?
Having had experience with Restless Leg Syndrome and a doctor throwing pharmaceuticals at the problem, I can tell you this from experience.  Some doctors prescribe benzodiazephines like Klonopin as an off-label use for this drug.  For me this was nothing less than a nightmare.  If anyone throws Klonopin at you, just read everything Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac says about her physician prescribed Klonopin addiction.
This is exactly what my sleeping heart rate charts looks like--one straight dotted line.  It has been going on for over a week.  All my past data on these charts is not longer showing as well.
I’ve had the same issue since last week. Simplified every night. It’s got to be the update.
@Bartfliet - what sort of books were you reading before and what did you read last night?  I recommend either short stories or books with short chapters and definitely not hardback or anything that makes you think... the less you have to think while you're in bed, the better.  Also, where were you when you tried reading before?  I find that if I read down here in the living room, I'm wide awake by the time I get up to bed, so reading a magazine while I'm laying down and I've taken my glasses off and turned the main bedroom light off (I read using just the light of a bedside light so that it's not as bright and stimulating for my brain) is the last thing I do, so that I just put the magazine on the floor, curl up and I'm usually asleep pretty much straight away.  The less there is to stimulate your brain at night, the better!

May I ask what meds are you taking that's helping? I can't use night guards (they make it worse for me) and I've tried so much! Anything you can suggest would be fabulous.
Ok, so...I would rather sleep then get up! I can go to bed at 10pm get up at 530am (kids off to school). Then go back to bed or couch from 715am- whenever I get back up or alarm goes off at 1230pm for work.How do I get motivated to stay awake and not go back to bed! I was going for walks with my dog, but it got really cold here.I really really really need to lose weight for health reasons.
I think the problem is you have to move around for a couple of minutes after getting up in the morning.  If you just sit up, and take your tracker off, it has no way of nothing that you are active, and to end the sleep cylce. That's why I suggested opening the app, and it would manually end the cycle.  I don't see a way around it.  You need have to be active for a few minutes...

Yes, but a weighted vest can be worn anytime, anywhere with the same concept of deep pressure therapy IF the weights lie directly ON the body like in a weighed blanket. If the weights are hanging on the vest or in hems or pockets--they DO NOT apply direct deep pressure to the wearer and won't have the calming effect. The patented  OTvest, weighed vest has weights that lie directly ON the sensory receptors of the wearer--across the upper back and upper chest. Not as much weight is needed when the weight lies directly ON the body in the strategic places as in the cool OTvest--which looks like a stylish denim vest! So it can calm all day long AND improve sleep! Wearers have sent in Fitbit readings where they were only getting five hours of sleep and after wearing the OTvest, weighted vest during the day--their sleep improved, according the their Fitbit--to between 8-9 hrs a night, and went back down to 5 hrs when they didn't wear the OTvest during the day!!  https://otvest.com/stress-anxiety/   or https://otvest.com/sleep-disorders-insomnia/
Wow, 20 hours is something. Having bad dreams is one of the disadvantages of sleeping. That Koala is hilarious.

My sleep stat graphs that appear down the right side of the dashboard (after you click sleep detail from the main dashboard) show 4 graphs, but they're 2 graphs repeated (Total Time Asleep and Total Times Awake, past 30 days). Can I customize these to show four DIFFERENT measures instead of two twice?
I am so sensitive to caffeine! I drink one cup of tea in the morning and that's it. If I have even a small amount of caffeine after noon, I'll never get to sleep that night. I hardly ever drink coffee. It's just too strong for me.

There's a great guy Shawn Stevenson. He's written a book called Sleep Smarter - it's well worth a read. Also you can check him out on You Tube. I'm finding it hard to get my 8 hours sleep - averaging at about 6:40.  Getting 50-60 min deep sleep. They say if you go to bed at 10am, you get the optimum sleep and recovery etc. Good luck!
As far as I know, the beta has been finished?As to the other part of the question, none of us know when it might be released widely. We can just wait or check the Fitbit blog for updates.

I really do not like this new sleep score feature.  I liked it best when it just told me how much time I slept.  Now you put an arbitrary number in the margin and on the graph.  Where is the option to just see the time like the old way?

It's normal don't worry. Even the info on the app tells you that it's "typical to see 10-30 awake times each night".

If you have basic fitbit, you tap it 3 times to get the lights to flash that you're putting it into sleep mode...if you're lying still, asleep or not, I don't think it can tell the difference...
amazing
Log into your dashboard via a Web browser, hover your mouse over the sleep pane (the square with the sleep data) and toward the bottom of the pane you should see a gear icon and 'see more'. Click there and you will be taken to a new view of only sleep data and on your right you will see 'Sleep Log' from there you can edit start and end time.

Is there any food or drink that you find soothing that you could try having each time you wake up after 1am?  How warm or cold is your bedroom?  Do you sleep alone or with a partner?  Is there any way you can do something like sit-ups or jogging on the spot or going up and down stairs several times to hopefully wear your body out a bit more?  Might be worth asking to be tested for sleep apnea too just in case you are woken up by stopping breathing like my husband was before he was diagnosed.

Hi @Odyssey13. Nice to see you around! 
 
I was reading what you shared and other tips, and that’s why it’s a good idea to give the home a thorough, dust-busting spring cleaning once the weather gets warmer. Indoor allergens typically include triggers like dust mites, mold, and pet dander, which tend to collect and thrive in the home, however it can also include pollen and all types of outdoor allergens that are tracked in from outside. These often settle onto furniture and floor surfaces.
 
Outdoor allergies: 
 
Tree pollen: 
Trees are the first plants to produce pollen each spring. Depending on where you live, tree pollen season can start in late winter or early spring.
 
Grass Pollen: 
Grass pollen is released from late spring through early summer and, because grasses are so widely grown, they’re responsible for a lot of nasal allergy symptoms.
 
Indoor allergies: 
 
Dust mites: Extreme humidity, flooding, or other types of water damage spur black mold growth. It tends to grow on building materials like fiberboard and on paper, dust, and lint.
 
Wow, I'm surprised on how what you mentioned can interfere with Sleep. Thanks for your input @Odyssey13.
 
See you around.

Just got my 3rd Charge 3 since Christmas 2018!  Complained that the 1st one would only show basic sleep details, no matter what I tried.  Fitbit sent me a new one.  Same results!  Then, Charge 3 #2 started losing the top of the time display.  Just received #3 and anxious to see if I will get detailed sleep info for the very first time since Christmas with 3 different devices.  My hopes are high, but my expectations are low, after the lack of help I got when calling in for assistance.  They made me send the first one back, before they would send the second one, but this time, they simply sent a whole new Charge 3!  Makes me wonder if a new model is on the horizon to correct problems they know exist with the Charge 3?  Has anyone out there achieved detailed sleep results with their Charge 3?  If so, what is your secret?  I have tried both wrists, high and low, tight and loose, and even wearing on the inside of the wrist, with nothing but basic sleep details.
I just created a post on how to get a fix for it if you have to manually edit your time to fall asleep to get the right minutes. 😉 It's in this post (click here).
Charge 2 has Relax - a new on-device guided breathing feature.  It helps to relax your body and mind while in bed.  See link below for more info. https://blog.fitbit.com/heres-why-youll-love-fitbits-new-guided-breathing-experience/

Your not doing any thing wrong. Set it to normal. Sensitive setting is to light of a setting for most adults. You have to understand that this device records any movements you have during the night . That's all it does. Most people will toss &turn for several minutes or even half an hour until you settle down and relax. Ask yourself, What is my routine before bed time? Do you drink any caffeine 4-6 hrs before bedtime? Your job? Is it stressful? Anything going on in your life that causes you to think about things before going to bed. There are a lot of factors to consider in getting a good restful sleep. Do you wake up with erections? This is normal in most males. When males get to REM sleep they will have an erections. This is completely normal. If no, then you are not reaching REM sleep, which is the deepest of sleep cycles and they usually occur 2-3 hrs. Before you awake. This is how impotency in diagnosed. If there are little or no stress in your life, then there are several factors to consider. 1. Restless Leg Syndrome. Do you wake up during the night with leg cramps? 2. Consult a sleep lab and consider a sleep study to determine what stages of sleep you are going through.Hope this helps. Anymore questions? Just emailSent from my iPad
Thanks, MakMak.Any other wisdom from the community?
Sleep score of 76 last night.  We went out to dinner later than normal and I was uncomfortably full when I got in bed last night.  My 70lb dog was pushed up against me all night, so I was having a hard time finding a comfortable sleeping position all night.  And then I was wide awake around 4:15am.  So, not great sleep and I had to adjust my sleep log because it thought I was sleeping this morning even though I was really awake with my thoughts.  🙂

Have you been to the doctor about this? Blood tests will determine if you have an underlying condition (depression, thyroid issues, etc.). How long have you been using the Fitbit? Perhaps a few weeks of reaching the recommended goals (i.e. 10,000 steps may help). But if it doesn't, see the doc. They might also want to do a sleep study.

hmm i've tried it over the past week or for sleep tracking and have been gotten constant 92-3% sleep effiencies. I've tried varying sleep patterns by sleep earlier and later and waking up earlier or later. Is your band set to sensitive? I am by no means a fitbit pro so my readings might be due to my inexperience use of this.
@stubble, That sounds like a worthy endeavor. So if I understand, you have a bunch of data in CSV, and want to create graphs from it?

Hi Paul, you might want to consider examining stress levels and emotional health.  I realize this is kind of personal, and it might seem kind of woo-woo and out there.  Yet the mind-body connection is strong.  Therapy tends to be the go-to recommendation for emotional trauma, and lots of studies demonstrate that yoga and meditation have positive impacts on stress, sleep, and overall well-being.  Personally, I have found alternative methods like acupuncture and reiki very helpful.  This website has some great free guided meditations of various lengths: http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22
Hello @Big-Gee, welcome to the community forums! @FloppyDrive, thank you for input and it's great to see you around! 
 
As mentioned by @FloppyDrive, the Oxygen variation data is limited. But the graph shows an estimate of the variations in your blood oxygen saturation throughout the night: 
 
1. Small variationsShow that your estimated blood oxygen saturation levels remained consistent.
 
2. Big variationsShow that your estimated blood oxygen saturation level fluctuated. A high variation on the graph may indicate you had variations or disturbances in your breathing during sleep.
 
For more information, I recommend visiting the following link: How do I track my estimated oxygen variation in the Fitbit app?. On a side note, your suggestion is greatly appreciated. While there isn't an option to click on any point on the variation line on the graph to get more details, I'd recommend to post this idea in the Feature Suggestions board so our developers can take it into consideration for new updates or product development. You can learn more about how Fitbit decides what suggestions get released in our FAQs

1 1/2 hours deep sleep.I'm interested to know what the best amount of deep sleep to have???
Hi there, 
Sometimes I'm woken by by son within 30 mins or so of falling asleep, so my fit bit misses the initial sleep and counts it from when I go back to sleep. On these occasions I sometimes go into the app in the morning to add a manual sleep log to count those extra minutes. But I'm finding that the app then alters the existing sleep log that it's registered. Yesterday when I woke up I'd had 6 hours 55 mins sleep, but it had missed the first 35 mins, so I added that log and it changed the 6 hrs 55 down to 6hrs 10...i deleted the 35 mins I'd added, but it's still only now registering 6 hrs 10!!! Anyone else finding this and how can I stop it? It's really annoying!
I have found it sometimes takes a few syncs to show up.  Have you tried to sync again?
I know 7-8 hours is the recommended amount of sleep per night. Does that include awake time? If I sleep 7-8 hours, I feel good. If I get 7-8 hours of sleep minus awake time (about 8-9 hours in bed) then I feel tired all day. I feel best with about 6-6.5 hours of sleep and .5-1 hours awake for a total of 7-7.5 hours in bed.
Right now my seep hasn't been real god, but hope after I have my shoulder scope done this month and strart my therapy the I will beable to get back to having "good nights". I have fought solid, osteoarthritis,with 7 surgeries since 2000.  But the pior ones have gotten back to being able to walk miles not feet without pain. So this one is just another hurdle to get over.
@G2EWS, as @G2EWS said that is a really good suggestion, I will look for it in the suggestion board but the link would make it easier.
Sleep tile disappeared about a week ago.i have tried all manoeuvres suggested to no avail. The FitBit is about 6 months old.i would like a  communication from the company as to what can be done or how I can be compensated..
Greetings, By setting bedtime at 9:00 pm and wake time at 8:59 pm, you can see wake and sleep states for the entire day.  Naps may need to be over an hour to be logged as "sleep" otherwise, that may show as, "Restless." This may be helpful; so far, it has worked for me.  Thank you, Cliff
Hi @DHarker Welcome to the forum. I occasionally have the same issue. A quick fix if to go to your dashboard, delete the sleep that auto logged, and then manual add the sleep back in (start and end time) and Fitbit will then populate the data. I'm not sure why this works, but it does and has for several others experiencing the same issue. Fingers crossed it works for you too.

I agree that it would be great if they offered more options for tracking sleep, I just find your sense of moral outrage wildly out of proportion to the actual offense. I mean, okay, I happen to wear my Fitbit One clipped onto my bra rather than my pocket/waistband, and that is one of the options advertised. BUT sometimes when I walk around carrying something in both arms it doesn't register my steps! And then when I look at the premium section that I PAID for, it tells me that I walked fewer steps than I actually did and so when I compare my semi-acurate information to the semi-acurate information from a non-random selection of other people (giving me information that is interesting but clearly in no way medically pertinent), I have no option but to believe that there's something WRONG with me! And, you know, AT LEAST 1/3 of American women sometimes walk while carrying something in both arms. Right? LOL
Have you had an answer to this? I'm having the same issue. Beginning to wonder what on earth I'm up to in those missing hours!

If you have a store in your area that sells oils, that's an easy way to see if you like a scent. Walmart sells some oils in the area near vitamins. You don't have to spend a lot to enjoy the aroma. Cotton balls will hold the oil and can be placed around the house. Enjoy your journey into aromatherapy!

Hmmm, no, I don't think you should have to manually enter your sleep.It can be tricky figuring out the tap sequence. You need to multiple tap until two lights blink then leave it alone to set it to sleep. I know I've multiple tapped over that a couple of times and lost the sleep tracking. I do have steps tracked during the night. I often get up during the night for the bathroom so I'm not sure what day the steps are counted in but I usually have a few hundred when I sync in the am. I don't think that's a problem.
Is there a fix for this. See attached snapshot.Thanks.
Never mind I found it.  The little "block" icon from ad block was blocking (hiding) the edit button in the log.

Hey there @FeelsLike. It sounds good idea in paper. But sleeping heart rate and  restlessness time it's important too. In my case, it's important to know how relaxed I'm during sleep and be aware of sleep heart rate. As you know much tossing and turning lowers your score, but if that's happens is for a reason. And getting those numbers helps me to pay attention to those details during night. I have asthma and I use my watch to check those changes.

Bought it three weeks ago and the sleep tracker device sometimes works ... sometimes doesn't.  Very disappointed as that's what I bought it for mainly.  Tried everything (logging in and out, restarting, cleaning sensor....).  Did you find a solution?
Similar story here, quite confused on what the difference is.  Normal setting on non-dominant it says I'm at 96% with over 6 hrs of sleep time.  In sensitive setting it is 65% with less then 4 hours of sleep.  I don't understand the huge discrepency non found any documentation from Fitbit on it.
fitbit is showing normal sleep cycling between light, deep and REM for me at night times, but I work shift patterns and quite often I just crash  in the afternoon the couch for 2 hours and wake up feeling like total garbage.  According to fitbit these naps are solid dark blue deep sleep.  is this accurate?
Has there been an explanation/answer for all the queries about Sleeping Heart rising above Resting Heart Rate and the shape of the graph ver reaching the downhill through?

Hi @KamilaF, The sleep data is viewed in the app, not on the tracker itself. Because of this, it will need a sync to get the data in the app. If you miss a day or a few days of syncing, it should catch up the previous nights' when you sync. At least that's how it's worked for me.

So i'm sitting on my bed, just woken up, I've sync'd my app· Where is my sleep report?It used to appear in minutes, but I can only see reports recorded 24hrs ago. I've returned to Fitbit after one year, has it changed?
Sorry, but it's very strange that, even if "Sleep stages are brand new" (I am not sure if you mean only for FitBit products - please clarify), they didn't think of a feature that was already available on Jawbone for about 2 years now (company sadly "died" recently - I was considering of buying the Up3 which has this feature), and which has already been a feature in specialized apps on the iPhone 4 (2010!!), when for the first time accelerator and gyroscope featured on a smartphone (I used it for a while during 2011 - 2012). I am considering buying a Fitbit device but the " Conditio sine qua non" is this feature !!
Will it help if we change our country to US in fitbit profile?
Hi Shay,Are you looking at the last sync time reported for your Charge3 each time that you check your Sleep graphs?  Because I find sync issues make it sometimes look like my sleep data is clearly wrong.  I'm not quite sure but I THINK that it sometimes shows "Today" as being YESTERDAY'S sleep, until it does a new sync for the day.  Mine's TERRIBLE in that respect.  And the display of old data is confusing.  So, be sure and look at how current your sync is, for the sleep from last night.
@kelfranHi, when I was little, I did sleepwalk.  And, my father did, too, actually for several years into his adulthood.  I haven't done any sleepwalking in a long time, and I don't think that was what was happening.  But, I'll pay attention, and see if I can determine whether I was active enough that the fitbit considered me up and awake.  Thanks for your reply.
In general, I find when altering the sleep times, I sometimes accidentally alter the date to be "last night", when it should be "tonight". This will cause it to try and create a sleep record that spans an entire day, and gives stats similar to what you posted. If you'd like us to see the chart, post it on a free image site like Imgur, and then post the link to it here. Not all of us use FB.

With a healthy sleeping pattern, deep sleep should not occur in the morning anyway. So at which point in the sleep cyle does Smart Wake aim to awake you? At the end of a REM stage would be ideal. Or does it just pick the next time you're awake anyway?
For the third night in a row, there was absolutely no record of me sleeping at all and I refuse to do it when it should be recording it automatically. Not happy with my Fitbit inspire at all. Changed it to "on wrist" now to give it one last chance, but if it doesn't record my sleep tonight I might as well have bought one that cost less than half the price I paid for the Fitbit Inspire 'cos it's not doing anything more than the cheap ones do unless I manually log it.  If it doesn't log my sleep by Wednesday it's getting a 2 star review on Amazon. I was hoping for better quality after paying a premium price but I was sooo wrong, obviously.

Hi @Mstrish1 On the Fitbit App, scroll down to the number of hours slept, then tap. The next screen will show your sleep score. On the top right side there is a settings symbol, tap on this symbol. Part way down the screen, you will see bedtime and wake up time. You can change the times by tapping on each one of them. Please let me know if this helps.
I'm glad I'm not the only one suffering through the nights. Heres my sleep for the 5 days since I got a FitBit, and again, as others have said, my partner is always saying I sleeptalk/move/just generally fidget, I often wake up with the duvet tied up around my legs or the sheet having come off the bed on my side, its always infuriated me, but I've never realised until now just how much of an impact it must be having. A quick backstory before I give you the horrifying figures, so I'm a Duty Manager in a busy Food Retail Store, if I get to have a break on my 8-10 hour shift I consider it a good day, customers are constantly in and out, items constantly running out, so I'm running backwards and forwards all day (so far a typical day at work is anywhere between 14,000 steps and 22,000 steps based over 4 days) I'm also trying (unsuccessfully so far, hence the FitBit) to improve my general health as I'd like to join the Army Reserves, and hopefully even join the Regulars down the line and do a few tours. On to the figures, so I thought this was perfectly normal to start with, until the misses got one, and her result came back at something around 7hr04mins out of 7hrs30mins give or take.  So I always aim for 8 hours, sometimes things (usually work) prevents that, but as you can see, I'm not quite getting 8 hours, one of the nights I did swap FitBits with my partner to see if my results changed, they and as you can see they didn't, so its not a faulty FitBit or anything, its a faulty me  Has anyone had any success in coming from this, to a decent amount of sleep? I'm tired of waking up in the morning feeling like I want to go to bed, people always remark on how tired I look, and as a Manager in Retail, I feel it sets a rather poor professional appearance because I also genuinely struggle to get out of bed in the mornings, leading to a somewhat hastily put on uniform. Any and all advice is muchly appreciated!!  I am also going to start scrolling through some of the previous messages for other advice too 😃Thanks for your time in reading this

The average deep sleep is a minimal amount of your overall sleep in the night. I find after taking medications sometimes I have a crazy amount of deep sleep waaaay more than normal. Anything can affect your sleep patterns from exercise to medications (including drinking.) that's definitely completely normal 🙂
In my Sleep Profile, on Premium, I'm told the typical REM is about 11%-23%. See above. The axis is a bit short of markers but that seems to be how it works out. In my nightly sleep stats, I'm told the typical range is 15%-25%. Why the difference?
I'm glad to hear that you are getting accurate sleep records. Thanks for letting us know.

Hi all my Charge 3 tracks my sleep and shows on the app but it shows 'sleep not tracked' on the fitbit itself... any help greatly received.
@eezeepee I did 10x8km +ins/outs to the camp. It was a relay event but I signed up without a team (hard to convince people by saying: hey, lets do 24hrs running event!). I hoped for 100km but tiredness was taking its toll and feet suffered a lot (good, for rock climbing I developed technique of using silicone toe caps, this helped a lot). Running tired wasn't too bad (and night laps where awesome). Resting in the camp was more exhausting (but had non-running friend with me, master of BBQ 😁). Some of my friends tell me that I did my first ultra-run but I disagree as the format doesn't match ultra. By the way, it would be good if Fitbit had option to resume tracking later. Otherwise, it made no sense to track it with Fitbit (I would need to record each segment as separate run). My sleep after that was more like recovering from sleep debt.
Good morning everyone!
 
Im new to this community and looking for suggestions/help. My problem is that i have been having problems due to the lack of concentration/attention for the last couple of years, then i was diagnosed with Attention deficit disorder, after this i started to take some medications that helped me improve my performance but not the way a i expected. 
 
Few weeks ago i got a Fitbit as a birthday present from my wife and loved it. After some days of use i realized im not getting enough deep sleep (between 5% and 9% of my total sleep time)  and i know thats related to some memory/concentration problems and then everything started to make sense to me.
 
Has anyone experienced something like this?
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
That's female tracking, maybe days until your period, or some such.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I took my laptop with me (I don't have a smart phone either) but my sleep doctor was completely uninterested in the data and said she would prefer I not look at it at all or bring it up during an appointment.  She was otherwise unhelpful as well, so I am curious if you took your results to a sleep doctor and how it went.
Hm, I may have started too hard then? (Going from a 23:00 bedtime to 22:00... but when I did that I thought I'd still need a full hour to fall asleep anyway. Hard to foresee, these things.)

@wannabfitSince you know you have sleep apnea, you must have a health care professional. Ask their advice on what would best work for you in light of your diagnosis. My sleep log often shows a low percentage but it depends on how restless I am or how often I get up to do something. It varies with each individual. Give it some time in tracking your sleep. You may want to take notes, too. It might help to keep a journal so you know when a stressful day leads to poor sleep or a great day leads to better sleep. Welcome to the forums.

It worked today!! I was able to update from "Sensitive" to "Normal" Sleep tracking!
My weekly report is all wrong because I took the dongle out of my computer and FitBit could not snyc for several days. Is there any way I can get the weekly report to be re-generated now that the correct data exists in my activity log? I would also like to delete the inaccurate one. Thanks!
Yes...I love my Fitbit, too.--
Moderator edit: personal info removed
A couple of things to keep in mind. One, the technology is very new, so we don't have to assume that all the numbers are completely correct. It's a work in progress. If you are experiencing actual symptoms of not feeling rested in the morning, go get a sleep study done (your doctor can refer you). The second thing is the chart posted above is not exactly a reason to worry. The average person experiences dozens of awakenings a night. We just don't remember most of them due to have brief they are.

I am wondering how accurate the sleep reports are?  Specifically, how is Sleep Efficiency calculated?  I see a sleep doctor and I want to show him my reports.  I just don't know if this is an accurate device to use as a true indicator of my sleep cycles.
Hello @SunsetRunner and welcome to the Help forums.  I'm sorry, but you can't change those labels.  It is a limitation of the technology that we all must accept.

After some research and a new app to set up my macros... Fitbit is great to track it all but I want to set specific grams per meal... measuring portions of food was too much variance in the calories I was eating for the activity I do... I wasn’t eating enough... Now I measure my macros in grams, keeping my proteins,carbs,fats balanced and enough calories... and I have more energy to do what I want,sleep much better,look less tired,and inches are shrinking 💥💥💥
Hi @BigjaE90, That's a good question. Once it detects sleep, Fitbit does count awake time as part of the sleep period. This makes sense to me, because there are many small awake periods during the night that are part of natural sleep. You've done exactly the right thing--compare your experience against the recommended numbers, and arrived at the amount of sleep you know you're body is wanting.Personally, I subtract all the awake time and call that "net sleep" )light sleep + REM + deep sleep). It appears my body enjoys about 6.5-7.5 hours of this net sleep. So my total sleep target as Fitbit tracks it is more like 8-9 total hours sleep.

I read an article that recommended wearing it on the ankle to sleep due to the electromagnetic fields. The reason the article gave is that it is farther from the brain when on your ankle than on your wrist.
Hello @sleepingtonight! It's great to meet you! I had an Inspire 2 and it did a fine job tracking my sleep and exercise. It's a very basic device, so it might work well for someone who doesn't want a bunch of extra features that they don't need. One thing to consider with the Inspire 2 is that it's a small device with a small display. Some people find it hard to read and prefer a larger device. If you think that might be an issue, a larger device like the Charge 4 or Charge 5 would be a good choice. I have a Charge 5 now and I am very happy with it.

It all depends on how which setting you're using. On the normal setting I was getting around 98 percent efficiency, which dropped to around 60 percent when I changed it to the sensitive mode. In other words, stating your efficiency without including which setting you're using is like comparing apples to oranges.
Hi @Thaddeus23This is one of the coolest presentations of Fitbit data I've seen yet. Thanks for posting it. I'm sure others will want to copy your ideas.

how to track your sleep:  tap repeatedly near the display area on your flex.  when it goes into sleep mode, you'll see two lights come on.   the lights are a bit apart, kind of looks like eyes  🙂  Do this when you go to bed.to get out of sleep mode, just tap repeatedly until you see all 5 lights flash.  do this when you wake up. when you sync your flex, the dashboard will include what was logged in sleep mode.  for example, how many minutes sleeping, restlesss, etc. can't speak to calorie burn accuracy....  krista
I used to listen to "delta wave" music (tons on youtube), which helped me to achieve deep sleep quicker. I started to feel reliant on it and stopped. Meditation seems to work better for me now.

The hubby has just said that the blue light filter that you use is different to the night light thingamejig - you can adjust how much darker your screen gets and what time it starts and stops... I've got mine going from 7pm to 7.30am and it really helps my body to start shutting down... if you use Windows 10 it's in the settings (cog) bit, then System, then it's right at the top... it really helps my body and mind to start winding down and getting ready for bed at 9pm-ish!  As you want to be asleep by 8.30pm, maybe set yours to go from 6pm to 5am or something like that?  It's not an instant fix, but if you're patient for a few days then hopefully that'll help you too?!

hmm...interesting question. I wear mine on my right wrist.  Normal sensitivity, and even when I know I'm having a great sleep, I still will change position...back, right side, left side...depending on temperatures and whatever.  I does track those as very short 'restless' periods. Did since the summer do some experimenting with melatonin (maybe an age thing?), which did in fact aid in faster to sleep and much more vivid dreams -- sign of deep rem sleep I think.  But wake up rested in same amount of time.
After not wearing my Fitbit for a few months I put it back on today and and just discovered this as well. It's really effed up. I've been using this feature for years for free and now they've taken it away from their loyal customers. Such bull**ahem**.
Completely agree. I have chronic insomnia and I try not to look at the clock in the middle of the night. But I like assessing when I was awake, for how long, etc. the next day. The sleep score is more than useless - it is demoralizing! I get what, for me, is a great night sleep and I get a "poor" or "fair." If the score isn't removed I'm going to stop wearing my Fitbit at night and then switch to another watch.
Is my Sleep Records Suppose to run from 12am to 12am? Say on 7-20-15 I go to bed at 8pm and sleep till 5am, should it show I got 9 hours of sleeps for 7-20-15?
The trackers don't have such feature @Robcorc Feel free to add your suggestions to the 'Feature Requests' Sub Forum, where users can vote, add comments,.. if there's a certain interest then there's a chance the developers pick it up and it'll be developed. Tip: Search if the idea already has been suggested and add your vote / comment!  Feature Suggestions URL: Click to go to the Feature Requests Forum
Hi There I have been wearing my fitbit for months with no problems but suddenly this morning it only collected basic sleep data (sleep, restless/awake times) and no sleep stages or sleep score. I have noticed from reading other posts that this has happened to others. Why would this have occurred and how can it be resolved? It seems to have collected my heart rate data over night so not sure why it did not log sleep stages. Thanks.
I'm going to try coloring in an adult coloring book ~!!
I apparently slept for over 6 hours last night but looking at my log I spent most of the night pretty restless. How can this mean I slept well? I have been getting 3-4 hours a night but again it is broken up with a lot of restless stages. I don't think I am getting into the healing stages at all!I took a screenshot of last night but I can't figure out how to get it on here!
i was wondering if this was a normal oxygen variation or if this was a possible symptom of sleep apnea. i do suffer from a lot of the symptoms of sleep apnea like daytime fatigue, anxiety, extreme morning dry mouth and a few other things. to make matters worse i have what i imagine to be a severely deviated septum. its so bad that i have trouble sleeping on my right side and i never ever sleep on my back. anyways i was just wondering if anyone has a similar EOV. and if its worth going to the doctor and/or getting a sleep study.

Hi kesaiserris, and everyone.I guess I'm a little surprised this hasn't come up, but I think you should research "idiopathic hypersomnia":https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-disorders-problems/idiopathic-hypersomnia-and-sleepIt is uncommon, but I'd say that it's worth looking into based on your description.I can tell that your sleep / wakefulness is having a profound impact on your life, you're really taking extraordinary measures to understand if your sleep is atypical. The references to narcolepsy also stood out to me (I think my pulmonologist who administered the sleep studies that led to my diagnosis mentioned strong similarities between idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy).I'll share my perspective on it; hopefully it can help anyone here narrow down the possibilities or understand a new possibility for themselves. This is how I ended up with my diagnosis (about 5 years ago, maybe 6?): I went to my regular doctor and told him I had bad sleep and would like to improve it, if possible. This was not new (my whole life I've struggled with sleep), but we went through a pretty methodical list of diagnostics. I went on a prescription of antidepressents (which, I'm very grateful to say, did help tremendously with the very legitimate depression I had and had not taken the time to address!); after some time it was clear that the depression symptoms were improving, but my sleep was still a struggle, so we looked around more.When I first read the list of symptoms for idiopathic hypersomnia I was stunned; it was maybe the only time in my life I've looked at a list of symptoms and didn't have to think "is this a thing? Am I trying to justify something here?" Symptom after symptom felt incredibly relevant and accurate.I can sum up my current take on it, which is: "pretty much all the time I'm falling asleep, even though I shouldn't be."Eventually I got a referral to a pulmonologist, we went through a long and (almost)-prohibitively expensive diagnostic process that ended up around $10,000 (Care Credit made that even possible, I also highly recommend them); but I ended up with a bunch of numbers and squiggly lines that showed a neurological root to my excessive sleepiness. There it was.There are several vigilance- and wakefulness promoters available through prescriptions. I've been on a stable dose of Modafinil for several years, and, for me personally, it has completely changed my life. I had not realized what a hell I was living in until I was out of it. Hopefully you've already found a great solution to your concerns that doesn't involve a diagnostic where you sleep with wires on your face, because that wasn't a *super* fun experience, I'll be the first to admit. But I'd check out idiopathic hypersomnia if not.

They did an update and have royally screwed things up.  I can enter my sleep times into the computer and it tells me how many hours I slept.  It gave me a list of asleep, restless and awake.  When I looked for more info it showed me a chart with colored lines, but no times like it used to show. I have written and written to the techies at Fitbit and asked them to stop "upgrading" and to put things back the way they were.  They tell me that the upgrades are to improve the experience and of course there will be glitches.  I should be patient while they iron out the problems.  I am from the old school and believe... "If it ain't broke ... Don't fix it".  These techies are like little boys who have to take things apart and then can't figure out why it doesn't work right when they put it back together and have left over parts.
Hi @adzify106, good to see you in the community. If you swipe right on the graph at the top of the main sleep overview, does the graph not change to hours slept? The sleep duration graph should have a line with your average for the week. I have included some screen shots below. Swipe right on the main overview graph to the second graph tile (hours slept) The hours slept graph should show a line with your average for the week.

@Lorenkwatson they only made sleep score available and not the 3 components / scores that make up the overall Sleep Score.  This is the data I was referring to as being hidden to non-subscribers.
Hey there @BeaRaemy, thanks for stopping by. Thanks for posting your inquiry here.
 
You must see sleep stages in order to see your sleep score information. Can you please provide me with a screenshot of your sleep information? If you see sleep stages but don’t see a sleep score:
 

Note that it may take a few minutes for your sleep score to appear. 
Update the Fitbit app to the latest version. For instructions, see About the Fitbit app.
Take into consideration the information provided in: Why don't I see sleep stages today?

If your device is still not registering your sleep after reviewing the information above, I recommend trying the following:
 

Manually sync the tracker. See instructions in How do Fitbit devices sync their data?
Restart the tracker. See instructions in How do I restart my Fitbit device?
Try sleeping with the tracker on your non-dominant hand.
If steps 1-3 don't work, I suggest manually logging your sleep to reflect the time slept. See instructions in How do I change my sleep history?

 
Give this a go and let me know the outcome.

mam50289, Thanks for the reply. I was referring to the velcro wrist band that you slip the fitbit in at night to wear on your wrist. The Velcro is not very strong. I might have to "sew" my own velcro in place or figure out another way to keep it secured to my wrist. Thanks so much.
I find that diet is a factor to sleep deprivation.  I normally have a well regulated diet, but I find if I eat sweets, I tend to have a restless night.  If you follow the guide MDadourian has set out in this first link, then try checking your diet.

Different things are going to affect your resting heart rate. Caffeine intake and hydration are a couple. However, the resting heart rate documented on my Fitbit can fluctuate a lot.
All models provide the same sleep tracking without premium.  Some people try to make it sound worse than it is because some extra sleep features require Premium, but nothing that varies by model, and nothing that you would lose.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I am seeing all of my daily values in the Health Metrics section now. Ididn't do anything, so I guess it got fixed in the cloud.
Thanks for the info, I am reassured to see women fitter than me with a night time heart rate not far off my paced level. I had been thinking 50 might be too high for me but it probably isn't. I guess I am just not used to having a pulse 🙂
The restlessness of sleep for a fitbit is measured by movement. The reasoning is that if you are moving around a lot during sleep that you are probably in the lighter levels of sleep instead of REM sleep where for the most part your body isn't moving. If I notice that I have a lot of movement I try to think back on my caffeine consumption, using electronic devices before bed, stress, etc to see what might be causing me to move around during sleep.
Has fitbot changed the way it calculates sleep with the last update?
Hi @RogerPerez, welcome to the community forums! @SunsetRunner, thanks for sharing your experience and for the tips! 
 
I think that everyone at some point have experienced different Sleep disorders, of course, everyone is different so the experiences certainly vary. I remember that 2 years ago I was having hard times to fall asleep and I discovered that there were factors such as caffeine, bed-room environment that were affecting me. (I wasn't aware of them) So I decided to look for help and I was able to find this Fitbit blog that has helped me a lot and I still practice all of the tips provided there and I can say, I've gotten positive 😴💤 results! 😊
 
Also, let me share that I found a helpful thread here in the community in which other users have provided different tips and they have also share their experiences. I bet you will get some benefits based on those experiences 😊
 
See you around.

My sleep activity is no longer appearing under activities.
If the FitBit senses you moving around (tossing and turning, changing sleeping positions) it marks that as restless sleep. A full night of that, and you aren't going to be well rested in the morning... Not sure on this, but I imagine if you go a long period with no movement it would mark that as deep sleep.
Mine is similar. It stops recording sleep too early, when I get up to use the bathroom and when I edit it to the time I later wake up, the earlier data changes. It makes me question the accuracy of all the sleep data!
I do know the benchmarks for deep and REM sleep are based off of scientific studies for different age groups. Since Restoration and Sleep Score are proprietary to Fitbit, there aren't (yet) external studies to yield these numbers. Because these features are so new, I would assume there's not enough data yet to make those types of comparisons even among the data Fitbit has collected so far. @brads13, you may want to consider adding this as a formal request to the Feature Suggestion section of the site, which Fitbit actively monitors for new ideas.

Thank you for the response.Both my wife and I got the versa, mine works fine (iphone 7)My wife's does not get the sleep score (iphone 11)versa 2 - both3 days - bothThanks again
I realise sleep tracking is all a bit crazy, but several times now I've had trouble getting to sleep, then feeling like I've been waking up a lot and lying awake, and then get up and feel pretty unrested and generally off. Not super tired or anything, but just feeling like I had a bad night. But the FitBit says I was fine. Maybe a little under my 30 day average on something, but benchmarking as pretty much average - or even better in terms of being awake. And I'm on the "sensitive" sleep tracking in my settings too. Just curious - do other people see this much?
Can I ask how low it was? I just got a 91 and I’m kinda freaking out!
Strange, mine was gone last week but is back today.  Even last week graphs are back.
No, it has always been inconsistent (and pretty much non-existent) for me, even with the Charge 2 I had before. I gave that one to my sister, and she gets sleep stages on a regular basis; so I’m pretty sure it has something to do with my body. Thanks for responding though.

oh same problem here, no Resting Heart Rate measurement either for todayEdit to add:I am in Melbourne, and use Versa 2 as well
Is there a way to rig a fitbit + apps to wake me when I nod? I use a CPAP machine set on 10 successfully. However, during the evening, I have a strong tendency to fall asleep at my computer or while watching TV. I try to combat the issue at my computer by standing up while working.  I am not worried about an alarm going off if I'm just still [ex. watching TV].  I find that when I nod, I may be out for a few minutes or an hour or two. I want to minimize the time I spend asleep without the CPAP.  Any product or app suggestions? ------changeagent7
@billonesty wrote:I am pretty sure I do not sleep walk. Last night I got up once around 6 am to go to the bathroom. The number of steps for the round trip is about 22, but the fitbit seems to have recorded twice that. And there are several other times in the night where it records 10 or fewer steps. My sleep sensitivity is set to normal and I know I put it in sleep mode before bed and took it out this morning. . I feel like I slept pretty well otherwise. Is the fitbit mistaking movement in bed for steps?@billonestyWas the sleep record in the sleep log, if so, that should not happen. Obviously if it was in the Activity Log there was not enough sedentary time for Fitbit to assume you were asleep and the activity timer was working. If that were the case, edit the record and change it to a sleep record. Ignore all of this if I'm not correct and if it is happening too frequently I would send an email to Support at this link

It seems to me that there is some bad math going on in the Sleep Stages calculations. Last night I slept 6 hours and 13 minutes - with 1 hour and 57 minutes of that being deep sleep. According to Fitbit I spent 27% of my sleep time in deep sleep. But here is the thing... 6x60+13 = 373 and 60+57= 117... follow that up with 117/373 you end up with 31%. So - that doesn't seem to match up. Factor in the 54 minutes I was awake and I end up with 37%. So how is this 27%? Is the formula for the calculations not taking into account that an hour is 60 minutes? Furthermore, when I look at the Hours in Sleep Stages it lists my Deep Sleep for the month as 12 hours and 3 minutes - but adding together the amount of time I spent in deep sleep over the course of the month I got considerably more than 12 hours in deep sleep - closer to 3 times that amount.
I just got my charge HR and its great.  My expanded dashboard is on my iphone and it very useful especially the auto sleep tracket.  However today when I went to my iphone dashboard - the auto sleep tracker is gone. Any idea on how to get it back on my dashboard on the iphone.  Thanks so much
@spicynachoo, thank you for your reply!

No sleep paralysis, and def not narcolepsy. Just low heart rate and blood pressure and almost always fall asleep (deep sleep) within a few minutes of laying down. My dad used to pick on me because I fell asleep sitting up during the Peach Bowl one year and slept like that through the entire game 😂 I always assume it’s because I wake up very early and most days I don’t have much down time. For my current job I wake up around 4, so bedtime for me is by 9pm (I’d prefer 7:30 but it’s not really possible). If I try to nap, I usually have a really hard time waking up and getting moving, I’m assuming because I immediately fall into deep sleep and my heart slows down to ~40 bpm. I wake up cranky and freezing cold, which is worse to me than not napping at all. Caffiene is one of my best friends at this point. When I discovered cold brew it helped a lot, because I don’t have to fool with making a pot of coffee or energy shots.
Hello! I have a rough time getting to sleep [I take melatonin at varying amounts sometimes, which can help but is not foolproof], but my  new Surge thinks I fall asleep the moment I lay down, even when i shift, change sides every 5 minutes etc [it says Im restlessly asleep during this point, but I know I am not, because I check the time every so often].  likewise if I lay down to read it thinks I am asleep.It's set the normal. should i set it to sensitive or would that do the opposite? [its only my nondominant hand, and set accordingly]Thanks!Karen
@Aurora17 and @Itw It looks like @Rich_Laue has got the right idea, the thin red marks as I understand it are the minute times that you were either awake/restless for such a short period you may have not noticed it, so it is periods of time that you are not in any of the other 3 stages (on the mobile app if you tap on the main graph you can then swipe through each stage with a bit more of an explanation

Well, you don't seem to understand me, or you don't want to. You seem to be unwilling to admit that it is stupid that the efficiency score is still in the data that is pulled from the API, and that the 'new fancy sleep score' is not in that data. Or perhaps it is the 'new sleep score' but it is just labeled wrong in the JSON data.
I hadn't seen that. Thanks @Namyeknom!
Yeah me too past 5 days no records are being tracked or come up in sleep, stairs ect.??? Frustrated
I wish I had tips to share. I'm interested to see what other people think about this subject. I don't have a problem getting to sleep, but I often wake up too early and I can't stop thinking about everything I have to do the next day. It's really frustrating because the things I worry about aren't that important and, even if they were,  it's not like I can do anything about them at 3 AM.

I never have coffee after noon, usually done by 10.  Unfortunately, the pup knows that I get up at 7 most days so she wakes up at that time even if I don't have to. She sleeps quietly through the night otherwise.I'll be honest, I'm skeptical that mint tea or stretching will help. Is that what worked for you?
Hello @Chinni86, welcome to the community forums! @cathm, it's great to see you around and thanks for your input!
 
@Chinni86 I'm glad to know that you've been working so hard to achieve your fitness goals! Please keep up the great work! As you may know, getting enough quality sleep at the right times can help protect your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and safety. However; there are some factors such as stress, irregular sleep schedule, mental health disorders like anxiety and depression, physical illness and pain that interfere. 
 
I think most of us have had a similar experience and we have found some helpful tips. Here are some tips that have worked for me and I think other users will read your post and will also comment here to give you more ideas. 
 
1.Reduce blue light exposure in the evening. 
2. Stop watching TV and turn off any bright lights 2 hours before heading to bed.
3. Don’t drink alcohol. It also alters nighttime melatonin production, which plays a key role in your body’s circadian rhythm. 
4. Relax and clear your mind in the evening. Strategies include listening to relaxing music, reading a book, taking a hot bath, meditating, deep breathing, and visualization.
5. Taking a hot bath around 1 and a half before bed improved sleep quality and helped people get more deep sleep. 
6. Get a comfortable bed, mattress, and pillow
 
I also invite you to visit the following thread for more recommendations.

You should get tested at a Univ. sleep center.  What you both have described is similar to my condition.  There are three different sleep disorders, and narcolepsy is one.  Another is idiopathic hypersomnia, which is what I have and sounds similar to what you both describe.  It is treatable! Mike
Maybe try taking your Magnesium in the morning for a few months instead of just once to see if that helps?  Vitamins and minerals take time to build up, so maybe your body was still using up the supplies from a few months back?  I hope you find a solution that works for you soon  😊

Hi, You might want to read up here for the calories burned in one of the many discussion made. Hope it helps
Thanks.  Editing the log doesn't really meet my needs because I would lose the data on when I was awake/restless.  I just want to "glue" it together into one sleep event. Also it won't let me create a record that overlaps the existing records. I could probably get around that by deleting the existing records first, but again, I don't actually want to lose the data, I just want it presented in the same manner that it was on previous nights- as one sleep event.
mine is the mid 90s but I turn it to sensitive and drop to 60 I don't know where I should keep it at but My gess is to keep on the defelt setting. I not sure but if you sleep with your hand on your chest maybe it might pick up you breathing and or the interval time for movement is a lot less.  in senitive mode.
HI - I don't think the app has improved much in regard to the sleep functionality.  I track my REM but unfortunately the current functionality only allows me to see it intra day, so over time. I would be great if you could on REM and it would show you REM data points form the previous weeks (or longer). The current display show no trend analysis, so it misses a great opportunity to help be more conscious of their sleeping patterns over longer periods of time. I don’t feel you’ve really done anything with the app screen in some time. More functionality please 🙏🏻
Can I have a good or decent sleep score and have sleep apnea. So tired today and said I had a 77 score.However I had high variations (in yellow) on the blood oxygen variations.I seem to often get fairly high blood oxygen variations.
Hi  I have tried it on both normal and sensitive, both for two days each the varience between them was about 2-3%, however if you read the design for the sensitive setting, that is primerly for people with diagnosed sleeping conditions. Hope that helps  Trevor
So is "waking up" 11-15 times normal?   I don't remember being awake, so maybe that's REM?   Thanks!
Hello to you too! From this article about sleep stages: Why don't I see sleep stages today?There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your device’s battery is critically low. I hope this helps!

Hello everyone! 😁
 
Sleep apnea 😪 is a potentially serious sleep disorder and a condition that causes you to stop breathing for short periods while you’re sleeping. Some people with Sleep Apnea usually don't take in enough oxygen which causes to gasp and often wake up. 
 
Let's see the Causes: 
 

Complex sleep apnea syndrome, this is also known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, which occurs when someone has both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea. 
Obstructive sleep apnea, the more common form that occurs when throat muscles relax. 
Central sleep apnea, which occurs when your brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing. 

Some remedies for sleep apnea can bring great benefits. Here are some treatments to reduce Sleep Apnea symptoms:  
 
1. Avoid alcohol and smoking: Why Alcohol? Alcohol relaxes your throat muscles that control your breathing. It can lead to inflammation in your airways, blocking your airflow and it can also lead to snoring and an interrupted sleep cycle. 
 
Tobacco use can also add inflammation and swelling in your airways. This can worsen your snoring and your sleep apnea.
 

 
2. Try yoga: Exercise can improve sleep apnea, increase your energy and strengthen your heart. Sleep apnea is currently associated with decreased oxygen saturation in your blood. Therefore; Yoga can help you to improve your oxygen levels through its various breathing exercises. Yoga can reduce the amount of sleep interruptions you may experience. 
 

 
3. Use a humidifier: These are devices that add moisture to the air. Note that Dry air can irritate the body and respiratory system, so using a humidifier can help to open your airways, encourage clear breathing and also decrease congestion. 
 

 
Loud snoring can indicate a serious problem, but not everyone who has sleep apnea snores. Does anyone know other Sleep Apnea symptoms and remedies to treat it? 
 
I'd love reading your comments! 😃

Thank you ! i thought i slept well but i checked the dashboard when i woke i was in bed for 10 hours but only slept for 6 ! It's saying that i have 21 x restless sleep ... makes sense of why i feel so tired all the time.I do have a brain and spine condition hense why i'm keeping a sleep record and trying to keep a close eye on my health.x
Hi, It is my first post too and it is not really a reply, but to say I have experienced the exact same. I ended up buying a new FitBit. Just to find out that it was the same, but now I got a message saying that in order to see my sleep pattern I had to sign up for a Fitbit Premium. A tryout for 3 month and then to pay 79.99 £ a year. I got pretty angry, but after a couple of days I signed up, bacause that feature is one of the most important ones to me. But what I get is ridicoulous it is worth hardly anything, so I am sad and pretty angry. I have enjoyed mit Fitbit for 4-5 years.I might have to go and search for some other solution. I tried Apple watch 2 years ago, but because they did not have the great sleep tracker I went back to use my Fitbit again!
3 hours is what is required for detecting sleep stages, i.e. a 2.5 hour nap would not get sleep stages.  But brief waking periods do not prevent sleep stages.  I don't know how long of a period of wakefulness it would take to prevent stages. I assume you also are not using 'Begin Sleep Now', which can prevent sleep stages.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Judith, here's how you switch modes in the web app -- probably different in Android or iOS app:Log into Fitbit, and go to Dashboard.Select gear icon at top-right, and choose Settings.On the Settings page, select Devices in the nav bar at left.On the Devices page, go to the Sleep Tracking area below the Displat Settings -- you might have to scroll down to get to the area.Use the dropdown menu in the Sleep Tracking area to toggle between Normal and Sensitive.Sync your tracker. (Changes won't apply until you sync tracker.)
100% needs a smart alarm. Would not be that hard to code and would set it apart from the competition. Come on Fitbit, it's a no-brainer.
Woohoo!! The sleep function has begun working properly again! I assume the problem was a software issue, as there was an app update a few days ago. I'd stopped wearing the device, then decided to give it another go following the app update.  Appreciate the fix, Fitbit.
I tend to have the same thing. The other weird thing I have is that my heart rate always goes up a lot during this time- the opposite of what’s supposed to happen. I know this isn’t normal, but after hours of googling etc have not found an answer. I tend to sleep for 7.5-8hrs, so quite a lot. Any less than that and I still feel like I can’t get up in the morning.
Anyone have occasional restless nights when you're trying to fall asleep? What tips and tricks do you use to "clear" your mind??

I can vouch for what @john-is-my-name says re little sleep, but I did it the other way around. I've never been a good sleeper, and the common idea that you need to wake up early to push the body towards a certain rhythm never really worked, I always ended up tired during the day without benefit. What has worked for me is that, instead of pushing the mornings to be shorter, I set up a time to go to bed and create a routing that helps you do that (whatever works for you: reading, meditation, exercise at a certain time before, whatever works) and make a conscious decision to end the day at that time. Personally, increasing exercise levels in the early days of this experiment helped me be tired enough to sleep easily and create a virtuous circle. I also started putting my silent alarm 30 earlier, with the intention of having a little snooze time in case I need it, but after a very short time what started to happen is that the body just takes the sleep it needs and wakes way before the alarm. I'm usually preparing breakfast when the alarm goes off. Also the total wake time during sleep is reduced and the proportion of REM/Deep/Light started to converge towards the benchmark. Each body is different and has different patters but my take away from this practice is that the time old belief is true: if you go to bed early, you'll be fine in the morning and you'll have sustainable better sleep.
I'm 45 years old,  5'5 and 135 pounds. My resting heart rate is around 55 and my sleeping heart rate usually drops into the upper 40s.

Due to you sleep periods having an awake period between them they where recorded as two independent periods of sleep. With both periods being longer than 3 hours they both received a sleep score.
Sleep on the FitBit is monitored by heart rate levels--so really what you need is a HR alarm set to to go off when your rate dips below a certain threshold at certain times of the day. The SpO2 sensor, if it were Available & active, would also help measure Oxygen levels in your extremities, if you had problems with Sleep apnea.
How long did it take you to get used to wearing a fitbit when sleeping?  I have recently (on day two of wearing it now) bought a charge 2 as I wanted to be able to monitor my heart rate and sleeping patterns as well as exercise. I slept fine with it the first night, it only showed up that I had a few restless periods, but last night I actually had dreams about wearing it!  I dreamed about trying to check on my sleep pattern in the middle of the night and kept on waking up very confused. Dreams similar to this are nothing really new to me, it's a bit of a sign of some background stress and it normally stops after a while. I was just wondering if any one else was weird like me and had dreams about their fitbit?

Thank you for your helpful feedback!
Check your settings, do you have it set to sensitive? Dominant hand? I wear my Charge HR on my dominant hand and do not have it set to sensitive.
Just wondering if anyone else has the problem that I'm having with sleep analysis. Today my sleep analysis stated that I got less than 5 hours of sleep and that I was awake/restless most of the time. In actuality, I got almost 8 hours if sleep, woke up in the exact same spot as when I went to sleep and awakened fully rested and raring to go! Is there a problem with my Blaze? Every time it says I've had a good rest, I'm exhausted. When it says I've had a horrible night, I feel amazingly wonderful! It actually makes me wonder if this thing really is tracking my sleep. I have another sleep tracker and it always tracks my sleep accurately to how I slept and how refreshed I am. Anyone??

He could be right, but at the same time particularly at the moment, I would rather listen to my body than injure it. Skiing was great. Its sent up my weekly steps to near the top, which is what I love to see. It is health week at my school at the moment and its been great fun doing exercises (hopping, star jumps, sit ups, press ups & burpees) with the kids. We were timed for a minute for each task. I look forward to see if  I can beat my numbers of each tomorrow.  A couple more days of work and then its the holidays! My gym membership is frozen for this month so it will push me to focus more on cardio. My brother's fiancee's hen do coming up mid April will be a break from exercise though... Apart from http://www.westcountrygames.co.uk/games/, which will be interesting to log on Fitbit.. Ha ha! I am so impressed with those that can do exercise first thing in the morning before work. I will try going early on Friday but would like to make it a long run as I am not working then. Hope all is well with you Michael..? Skiing was fun, had to stretch quite a bit after Saturday as my lower calf was quite painful. It is not usually a pain I get after skiing I must admit! I felt super guilty yesterday that I was too tired to do any exercise, I even drove to the gym to eat a banana and a smoothie in hope it would help my energy to come back for run club- but no, it didn't help.   Hey @Hats26 you are not at all pathetic, you are smart to feel what your body is telling you.  If you must walk, you must walk, period.  A runners body takes an incredible beating through the years, that is undeniable.  At this point, we would hate for you to injure yourself through training.   Seems like you are plenty active with all the things going on in your life. Skiing is incredibly difficult and very good exercise.  Most people that are not trained skiers will notice a great deal of soreness after skiing.  I always recommend a good rest to let the body recover, with plenty of water and a raw whole foods. If you have holidays coming soon, might be a perfect time to let your body truly recover.  I hope you will continue to keep the positive attitude, that is the most important foundation.

You know that Fitbit can't measure sleep stages anywhere near accurately, right? There was a recent study about this. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420528.2017.1413578 Obviously Fitbit should still fix this bug (it's happened to me a few times as well), but please don't rely on it for medical use.
I have an Alta HR. I don't take naps often, but when I do, it does track my naps. I took one today (hey, donating blood takes it out of ya), and it tracked my nap.
So fitbit doesn't use the 24 hour clock so I'm finding it a bit difficult to understand the timining of my sleep scores. For example it says TOday: 11:12pm-12:52pm  Its currently 8:20pm so this makes no sense. So how do I know which day is which?  FOr example  look at friday: I've got 10:55pm - 8:03 am... this is wrong... this is two days and not on friday. Is this acutally Thursday night/Friday Morning. but then I also have a friday that is 8:31pm- 9:34 PM Its really confusing and I couldn't find anywhere to explain how it works. and how to read it. I worked in HR and with a para-military organization for years. We always used the correct day. For example if someone worked 10pm-6am crossing two days the data would be entered as two entries as each entry was occurring on a different day. Anyways regardless, Where can I find info on Fitbit's standard for the sleep scores and what process they are using?
Hi @WilsonFitbit,thanks for the link! It only mentions the heart rate sensor but my comment is regarding the active Bluetooth on the device and its influence on melatonin, not the heart rate sensor 🙂
@SunsetRunner Have you tried to mix it with white noise? I use the Calm Radio app to mix music with other sounds.
 
Normally I play the music with a Bluetooth speaker, but I'll try with my Bluetooth earbuds as you do.

You can try syncing your Fitbit right when you wake up. It usually works because syncing the Fitbit by opening the app requires you to click on the app. If that doesn't work, go on the app before you sleep, click on the sleep section, and hit "Begin Sleep Now". When you wake up, go back to the app and click "I'm Awake" or the button that declares you are awake (I am unsure of the exact phrasing). Worst comes to worst, take a bunch of steps before you shower, because it should trigger the Fitbit and let it know you are awake and moving around. I hope this helps 🙂

I don't think I am ready for that.
What Fitbit Or sleep app are you using?
If you wear your Fitbit loose then I'd snug it down a bit and see if the anomaly happens again; if not, chalk it up to the loose band. The other issue, to me at least, is your seemingly high heart rate when you sleep; from my perspective at least, a sleeping heart rate up in the 70s sounds way too high. I have always had a slow heart rate, and even now in my mid-60s my sleeping heart rate rarely rises out of the 30s.
Hello @luckypenguin. Welcome to the community forums! 
 
I'd like to share some tips that have worked for me. 😁 Poor sleep can have negative effects on many parts of your body and brain, including learning, memory, mood, emotions, and various biological functions. 
 
1. Avoid naps during the day: 
I'm not sure if you usually take naps but I used to do it frequently and that had a very big impact in my sleep routine. While naps of short duration have been linked to improvements in alertness and well-being, there are mixed opinions about the effects of napping on nighttime sleep. 
 
2. Listen to relaxing music: 
Music can significantly improve quality of sleep. It can even be used to improve chronic sleep disorders, such as insomnia. 
 
3. Exercise during the day: 
Exercise can increase the duration and quality of sleep by boosting the production of serotonin in the brain and decreasing levels of cortisol, the stress hormone. The time of the day when you exercise is also critical. To promote better quality sleep, working out early in the morning appears to be better than working out later in the day
 
4. Turn off all electronics: 
Using electronic devices late at night is terrible for sleep. Watching TV, playing video games, using a cell phone, and social networking can make it significantly harder for you to fall and stay asleep. 
 
These are some of the tips that I've tried so far, specifically the number 4 and my sleep has improved a lot. 😴😴. On a side note, I invite you to visit the following thread for other tips and suggestions. But, if you still notice your sleep activity doesn't improve despite following many tips, I think it is recommended to contact your doctor for profesional advise. 
 
See you around.

I am in bed 7 hours and says am only sleeping 4 hours and lots of restless stuff what does this mean?am very new at this dont know what half of it means  means
That's a good advice @BruceM, thank you for sharing. 
 
My goal is to be able to get to the point where I go with the flow and just wake up more naturally, while still being able to get a few things done in the morning. I've just gotten used to waking up to an alarm over the years. 🛌

Hi @negodkin Has the issue with sleep statistics not showing up corrected itself? If not, try restarting your tracker. 

Marci | Bellevue, WA
Two years late to the discussion but I wondered the same thing (which is of course how I came here :-). I have had a couple different Fitbit models and have had the same experience. I have compared nights I wore my CPAP and nights I didn't. I definitely see less deep sleep reported by my Fitbit when I wear my CPAP and maybe less REM as well. I also see lower reported estimated oxygen variation, tossing and turning, and sleeping heart rate.
I wish I could sleep in on my off days. I swear I feel like I have a alarm clock set everyday. No matter what I always wake up at 6am and with a 5 and 2 year old they definitely don't make it any easier.
is the Heart Rate notification on? It should be triggered by such sort of events
I set my sleep schedule yesterdat and I noticed today that my tracker did not even log my sleep time automatically. I have the flex. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks
Hi @LisaaMariee,,Thanks for sharing your wonderful love letter to sleep. I hope it comes to visit, and stays all night from now on. Have you tried the usual tricks and tips for sleep..such as sleep mask, keeping bedroom cool, not using electronics for a few hours before bedtime?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Agree! I want to share my sleep stats with my partner, not with everyone I have friended in Fitbit!! Having ‘friends’ is the only way to set up challenges but it doesn’t mean I want all my personal days available to all of them. Fitbit should allow you to share specific things with specific friends
I have found that if I change the start or end time back to what it was originally, then the original tracking is restored. Hope this will work for you BikeBot. For my own part I am still waiting for an explanation from Fitbit why the tracking for the whole night invariably changes whenever I edit start or end time of my sleep.
same problem;  checked with Fitbit support,  deleted/reloaded app,  wait til next morn.......still not there
Hey there @EW0103 welcome to the Community! I've heard about this neurological disorder before and found a link that might help you http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/narcolepsy
 
It also mentions that to reduce symptoms, some adjustments in your lifestyle may also help such as:
 

Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and heavy meals
Regulating sleep schedules
Scheduling daytime naps (10-15 minutes in length)
Establishing a normal exercise and meal schedule

@SunsetRunnerI don't know which is more accurate, but are you logging your workouts in addition to the data that your Fitbit automatically calculates? If not, that may be the cause of some of the discrepancy.
Okay that make sense
@eezeepee it's after 24hrs endurance race (8k trail segments repeated over 24 hours as many times as possible). I remember I woke up with mild fever and after hydrating I went back to bed but Fitbit didn't catch that part of sleep.
i did all the above but the the sleep score has stopped showing after two weeks. It was the reason i bought a Fitbit. I have deleted the app and reinstalled but so far Fitbit sleep score has not worked. The info on this from Fitbit has been outstanding useless. If it is a known fault in the Fitbit,  I should be able to get a refund on a Not for Purpose unit.
Hello @Lindamariebooth  First I moved this post to the section about Sleep Well.Second I think there is no hard number, basically restorative sleep happens when you are below your resting heart rate, even 1 or 2 BPM is enough. Of course this is not the only factor having an influence, and I guess we are not even sure of the causation here, just that there is a correlation between being well restored and heart rate below resting heart rate while sleeping.
Hello. I've been having sleep issues since.....forever. Since I was a child I remember looking at a clock until 4am in the morning.At some point i've tried Melatonin (1 night only, when I was a student), but I woke up so tired, just like I never slept.So usually when I was student and had an exam, stay awake all night, coffee, cigarettes, getting the exam, get home at 4-5pm next day and then sleep until next morning.I've read a book about sleep stages, "Sleep" by Nick Littlehales. It helped alot and I started to use some techniques from there. Now, I'm 30, work exclusively from home and have a 1 year daughter. My go to bed schedule is the following:- 23:30 - 01:00 - reading- 01:00 - 01:30 - sudoku (you can laugh) to kill any processing power left in my brainThen I fell asleep in 5mins or so (before this it would take me about 30m - 1h30m to fell asleep)In the morning I wake up at 9:00-9:20. I'll try now to push everything down by 30mins so I can wake up 30mins earlier. Hope this helps.
If you tap on it repeatedly with quick sharp taps it will vibrate on your wrist to let you know it is in sleep mode.
Where is the sleep efficiency % from?? It does not show up in my app or online.  I know I could calculate it based on minutes, but I would like it to show me efficiency % like that!!
Lordgoata that gadget looks really good. It would help me to know about light, mid and deep stages of sleep. I almost always remember my dreams, sometimes several dreams, every night, so I think I am stuck in REM a lot and don't get into deep often. I know my cycle is 60 mins instead of the normal 90 mins. I will chat with my GP and see if I can get a referral, if not, I will get the Sleepace Reston and get some more evidence of my abnormal sleep pattern. Thanks!
I havent been able to get the sleep tracker to work. I followed the directions and tapped it twice, waited for the lights to blink across the screen, next morning, nothing. Am I doing something wrong?
Agree.  It's built-in obsolescence.  If everyone was satisfied with the current product, the company would lose sales revenue and go out of business.
@WyldHaggiswrote:Hm, I may have started too hard then? (Going from a 23:00 bedtime to 22:00... but when I did that I thought I'd still need a full hour to fall asleep anyway. Hard to foresee, these things.)  Yes, I think the body gets very ingrained with sleep patterns, and it takes time and small increments to make changes. That's just my observation.

Yes, I take my logs with me to see my sleep doctor. I take a screen shot of each sleep log and put them all in one file, with notes on what I used (meds) or did special that night (called a hygiene routine).
This is not a normal, if you already restarted your Fitbit, please feel free to write to our support team. They might have to check what is happening with your Fitbit.
 
Hope this helps.

I'm ambidextrous. I do everything left handed except write(I write with both hands but mostly right as years ago in school, they made me use my right hand). I keep it on my left as I'm a full time nursing student (at 45 😉 & I write A LOT!! I've figured out all the writing was counting as steps!!
Do you know if putting your phone in flight mode affects this? I don’t like having my phone on or not in flight mode while I sleep, however even with sleep sensitivity on instead of normal, I only get results that look like the one from the normal setting (awake-restless-asleep). I want to see all my sleep stages though... any advice?
Hey everyone! I’ve had my Fitbit charge 2 for a month now and don’t understand this sleep thing. I’ve read the manual and search countless articles here on the forums. However, my dilemma is that it rarely tells me sleep stages. Only twice in the past month has it registered deep sleep or rem. Other than those two times, it just shows asleep, restless, or awake. Surely I am getting deep sleep more than twice in a month. I also changed the sensitivity setting which was suggested in another forum but then my Fitbit app showed I was restless/awake for 5 out of 8 hours a night. So I changed it back to normal. I tried wearing is lower on my wrist or tighter but nothing seems to be getting it to register deep or rem sleep.  If anyone can give me suggestions for my Fitbit that would be great.
In fact it presumes started to dream when using the tracker yet laying still for a minimum of an hour.
Thank you. 🙂You are right, my sleep are even worse if  I am overly tired.A typical nigh for me, may look like this:I go to bed at the same time every night, but even if I can sleep longer in the morning i wake up early anyway.  In hours I get enough sleep, but ...I'll take your advice to relax for a few days to see if that helps.  🙂  The picture was a little blurry, but the details are:Awake: 34 times, 47 minutes, 9 %  (3 times awake, 31 times restless)Rem: 1 hour 20  minutes, 16,4 %Light sleep: 5 hours 33 minutes, 65 %Deep sleep: 58 minutes, 11 %
Try to update the app from the app store. This has fixed this problem for others.
Hi there, @M.Aurelio. Thank you for your participation in the forums.
 
I can see that you already found this suggestion: Monthly view of different sleep stages. This is a great way to make your voice heard. Members of the Community can post new ideas in this board so they can be implemented in a future updates, this is a great way to make your voice heard.

You’re not overly hot or cold? Don’t have to go to the bathroom (not just pee)? Have you thought about getting out of bed for that hour or so and doing either something relaxing or very light chores (like washing dishes or getting laundry started)?  Then go back to bed and see if you can sleep.  I’ve done this when I’ve wakened in the night.  An hour or so later and I sleep again.
I have this same exact issue, (with my Inspire2) and its so frustrating. I'm so confused, like it must not be a common issue if nobody has a solution, so... Idk. Just, why?
Try skipping ALL screen time after dinner.I also wonder if the tightness of the wrist strap is a culprit in bad sleep records. Mine is loose because I read about the germs they carry. REM Sleep Disorder, characterized by acting out your dreams physically, causes my 50% sleep efficiency.
Perhaps a person's sleep chronotype or circadian rhythm would affect the amount of time one's sleeping heart rate dips below resting heart rate.  Perhaps Fitbit will take this into consideration in setting up their algorithms.  I am not sure how to make such a recommendation -- are you?
You can, depending on which model it is (which you didn't say).

Hello 😊 Am only in my first WK of using a fitbit sense so am quite new to all of this. I specifically got it to track my sleep. I never get a very deep sleep, I may be insomniac too, always am fatigued. I do have other health issues that contribute to that but my gut has been telling me there is something not right about my sleeping. I've not being diagnosed as having sleep apnea but having many yellow fluctuations in my graph maybe it's a possibility. I'm not sure how to.post the graph but it saw somewhere that you can't post an image until you post at least once so will try that 😊
@_Louise_ thanks for reaching out! This new feature is not encompassed by a new tile - instead, it is within the sleep tile that you can set a Sleep Schedule. If you go to your dashboard on your mobile device and click on the gear icon, you should see the Sleep Goals page pop up. Here, you can set the Sleep Schedule. Let me know if you have any other questions!
 
@PDX_Karen I'm glad you figured out where to set the Sleep Schedule! Thanks for troubleshooting 🙂 
 
@Scott4 if you click on your sleep tile within your app, please click on  the gear icon. If you don't see the Sleep Goals page pop up, please let me know! Screenshots are always helpful as well. Thanks!

Hi @AlanJB and @DanielleinDC, For me, there is a big difference. Getting some extras hours of sleep during the weekend helps, but not near as much as adding even a half hour to each night's sleep during the week. The weekend sleep gives some relief, but it's adding time onto the other 5 days of the week is what really gets one out of sleep debt. A lot of the recuperative value of sleep is based on having a regular schedule.But like @DanielleinDC said, we do what we can.

Hi, I don’t usually get high variations but I noticed this today and it looks (to my untrained eye) very alarming! Should I be worried about this? It may be worth noting that I am unwell with the flu currently. I have tremendous health anxiety and this isn’t helping my cause! Thanks for any advice
I am noticing my Light Sleep can be 7hrs but my Deep Sleep is minimal.. sometimes only an 1hr... im abit concerned... any ideas what i can do????  thanks
Nice article
I was very interested in getting the Flex to track my sleep.  Once I started seeing how much I was waking up and restless during the night, I had even more issues with sleeping.  I want to go back to tracking sleep but trying not to over-obsess about it is going to be a challenge.  Anyone else having this issue?
Karen4uMy solution may sound different and harsh but it is sure to succeedTell your self u would do 1000 - 2000 steps before u sleep again Believe me it will work

From everything ive read and heard about recent studies. 6 hours of sleep is not enough for anybody. In fact its quite scary missing even 30 minutes of recommended sleep.
Why not make it optional or hidden in the stats, like the cardio score? Which you see only when you are intentionally looking for it.
The only way I've found to change it is to restore the original time.You could try experimenting with various times.Good luck.
Everything else works fine I think...it just will not track my sleep! I do understand that I don’t sleep very well at all and I’ve struggled with sleeping for a very long time. I’m confused.....my tracker will collect my sleep and show me one night and then his week or even longer with nothin but an occasional 42min or 1hr 20min never consisted....any suggestions? I’m convinced I’m just dead with no pulse when I do get to sleep....lolLee
A suggestion that sleep records should have an option to be amended, i some how did not turn my fit bit flex off sleep mode. and realised a few hours into my work morning...i work with children so i was "awake/restless" for like 45 times haha

Hi @dcychen, thanks for posting! 
 
I'm sorry to know about the experience but I hope things get better soon for your toddler. As mentioned on a post above, Ace and Ace 2 are the only trackers for kids and the Ace 2 is the only one that tracks sleep. 
 
Ace 2, is an activity tracker designed for kids ages 6+ so I believe it can't be used by your toddler. Take a moment to review our complete safety information at fitbit.com/safety. Ace 2 is not intended to provide medical or scientific data.

I just use a meditation app (either breethe or calm) to FALL asleep. always puts me in a good place of mind before drifting off.
Dave; I got an idea from your idea; My pre-bed read-and-relax is a great time to charge my FitBit. Thanks!
I haven't seen that mentioned in the documentation, so I will say no. The Fitbit alarm is a standard one, and doesn't adjust on the fly like that. I've used that kind of feature on a smartphone app before. It's really nice, but pretty complex in terms of the programming I believe. The tracker has very limited memory resources compared to a phone, so it won't have the same robustness in its function. I like the idea a lot, and hope you head over to the Feature Suggestion board and add that as a request. If enough people vote for it, they may implement it next time around.

Sleep hasnt been logging by band tapping as it has been fine until last few days. So last night tried setting from phone, didn't know you could do it that way.   It worked except it logged as 10:20-6:20 instead of 1:20-6:20.  I really don't want to have to write stuff down or keep track of this or keep entering info manually.  What's the point of wearing it at night if I have to do itall myself? TIA,Mary

I've got a question..... I got the Charge HR for my birthday a couple of weeks ago and gave my Flex to my husband.  My sleep patterns are bizarre.  Most nights I have a few times awake, even though I don't remember waking up and lots of restless minutes, generally 100+.  My Fitbit is on sensitive, but this is ridiculous.  Since I've had the Charge, I'm getting reports that I go to sleep say at 10:30 p.m. and it registers sleeping from then until about 12:15, and then there is nothing registered for approx. an hour.  Then it says I was sleeping from 1:20 a.m. to 5:20 a.m., but with lots of restless periods.  Does anyone know what this means?  No wonder I'm so tired all the time.  Are they really accurate?
I am also a night exerciser due to the heat. Although, I do exercise indoors on my treadmill and Total Gym, I do wait until I lower my A/C at night. I'm also very much a night owl! I'm not sure if I can exercise in the mornings. Really doubtful. Good luck with stepping away from the electronics at 8pm. I'm going to try to step away earlier from my laptop but I will have the tv on. In fact, I go to sleep with the television on. Bad idea but I can't really sleep without it.
In the Log, under sleep, on the website. I see a percentage, in a box in the sleep area near the restless and awake.

I usually wake up at 3 in the morning.  These are the things I do to fall back to sleep - First, I try counting.  If that doesn't work, I try clearing my mind and think of nothing (it is hard to do and takes practice but really helps).
Thanks so much for sharing.  I don't know if you saw one of my posts that my 2 doctors don't agree on my sleep study.  One says I'm not that bad; the other says I need to be treated.  I'm trying to gather information to make an educated decision. I appreciate your info.
@GoldieU you ask about the Sleep Tracker and restless sleep.... that is the main reason I got my Flex. And it has proven worthy in solving some of my sleep patterns. The tracker cannot diagnose you but it will provide pertinent data that will enable you to better understand and possible help you improve your sleep status. Restless sleep is an interruption from your sound sleep... movement or getting out of bed will show up this way. For details about the sleep function got to http://help.fitbit.com/  and choose your area of concern. Happy ZZZZZs make for Happy Energetic Days... you may find a pattern ... like every night at 3am you are restless for a few minutes or longer... then you can try to seek the why... I have a dog... she influences my movement... I too am always restless at the same time of night which really made me aware and gave me data to discus with my doctor. Bottom line is that the sleep tracker over time will allow you to associate a why for the patterns that surface. Your restlessness cause might be as simple as what you ate before you went to bed. May you sleep be sound and restless free soon.

Hello, I recently charged my Fitbit after a couple of months of not using it.  The past two nights it's been completely inaccurate on recording my sleep.  I've been going to bed at 12:30 AM and waking at 9:00 AM.  The Fitbit has been recording my sleep as going to sleep at like 5:00 AM and waking at 7:30 AM. What's going on? Thanks for your help! Nan
Hi @cmommyof5 - Which Fitbit device do you have? And which Phone?  In general, there are two things to watch out for when you are not getting your sleep scores:Fit - Make sure you are wearing your device about an inch above your wrist bone, away from your hand. Not too tight but not too loose.Care of the area - Many of us like to apply hand lotion before retiring to bed. I know I do! Take care NOT to apply lotion to the area that will be under the Fitbit sensors. Also wipe the back of your device to make sure nothing has accumulated there. If these tips do not work, I can offer more once I know which Fitbit device you have.

I've been monitoring my sleep since I've gotton my Fitbit about 1 1/2 months ago, and it says I've been reslesss around 30-45x / night and awake 3-8x/ night, losing around 2 hours of sleep per night. I've checked the sensitivity and it is set on normal. Even before I got my fitbit, I've always been tired during the days, needing at least one nap and having to got to bed early each night. I've cut out all caffeine out of my diet to see if that would help, and nothing!Does this mean anything??
UPDATE: My tracker is now tracking time in the middle of night when I am sleeping (likely REM) as awake. These aren't short bouts of awake time (< few mins) but 15min+. I don't sleep walk or anything similar so I am unsure why I am getting these poor readings. I really think there are some serious flaws with the stage tracks; the option to revert back to the "old" sleep system or ability to change a stage would be a nice option in the interim.
Ok, noted - my job means that some times I finish work at different times.I am so tired that I need to have a sleep in the afternoon. I have tried to fight through it - but I don't sleep any better at night if I do and I get more and more grumpy as the days go by. I know thats bad sleep hygiene but if I do, I fatigue fast.
I'd like to hear your experience in regards to sleep tracking. I try to wear my Versa every night, following my sleep schedule. I don't use sensitive sleep settings on my watch since sometimes I move a lot at night and I don't like to see extra restless or awake time in the morning.
 
Some other night I remove my watch from my wrist before going to bed just to give a rest to my arms. I'd like to hear about your experience on how you're tracking your sleep. Do you track it every single night or do you prefer to track sleep on specific days of the week?
 
I've been improving my sleep habits since I'm aware of different things that can help me to have a better sleep score. 😊

Hi, I notice lately that I feel I get a longer, more restful sleep if I have a bedtime snack...(it’s usually a small cheat of protein with one carb)...my calories are about 2000 per day as I cheat if I go lower than that... unsure if I should up my total calories or save a bit of my daily allotted servings for a usual bedtime snack...any ideas?My burn is about 2100 to 2400 calories per day and  I am at my step and activity goal...still going through recomp and unsure yet of my final weight goal.

I have tracked my sleep for two nights so far.  Both nights, in normal setting, say I slept about 6.5 hours, with many interruptions or restless/awakened times.  17 x the first night and 20 x the second night.  I switched over to Sensitive setting and looked at the graph ---- WOW!  It says I really slept for a mere 3 hours and 39 minutes and was awakened 10 times.  Last night, I was lying awake for a long time...I remember it clearly because I actually got up and went downstairs to get two sleep aid pills.  I couldn't stand it anymore and was sick of just lying there awake!  In the normal mode, it doesn't reflect that.  In the sensitive mode it clearly shows I was awake for the time frame I remember being awake.  However, I have no idea how I can function ( went to work) on 3 hours and 39 min. of sleep, interrupted to boot!  Your thoughts on these two settings pretty please and thank you!

I think 1 1/2 hours deep sleep with about the same REM makes for a pretty good quality sleep.The most deep sleep I've had is 1 hour and 37 minutes plus 149 REM. That's out of 8 hrs 37 min total sleep. I notice the higher those numbers are the better I feel during the day.  There's a function in the fitbit app; open sleep, look at sleep stages and then click on benchmark which gives the averages for other fitbit users in your age group. I need to read up on information explaining the 'benchmark' percentages. It's not clear to me, yet.
I was so surprised that you told that I am using technology before sleep 🙂 Thanks for your reply, and I will try not to use any technology before I go to bed.
That's a pretty good idea. It would be interesting to compete to see who can rest the best. It sound like a lot of fun to be honest. You can always suggest ideas or new features here: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/idb-p/features I hope you get your idea through and have some sleeping competitions with coworkers/friends 

	Yours Truly,Geoffrey
Recently, the sleep tracker (Blaze) updated to include REM, light sleep and deep sleep tracking and not just the total minutes slept and awake time. That lasted about a week and then last night it went back to the old way of tracking sleep where it just gives you the total minutes slept and awake time. For last night, I am not able to see the break down of REM, light sleep and deep sleep like the past few days. Am I missing something? Why did it go back? Thanks!!!
This has happened to me too.  I went from averaging about 4 awakenings per hour to 4 awakenings per night.  Also, my sleep totals and sleep stage totals/percentages have changed going back back months.
Gotcha. In the settings inside the app, there's a section called Sleep. In there, make sure it's not set to Sensitive, which may cause it to underestimate your sleep. Also, try a restart and then let us know tomorrow if the sleep reporting improves. Restart Fitbit Tracker

Hi, I am also finding the information from the FitBit very interesting. I barely get a full hour of deep sleep according to my sleep trend data. However, I do think there are better ways to tackle this than medications.I have always been a terrible sleeper, and always had difficulty going to sleep, but this trend data is concerning for me so I am also looking for some ways to improve my sleep quality. I found an interesting article that might be of help to others. http://www.helpguide.org/life/sleep_tips.htm I think I am going to need to set a more stringent sleep schedule and take the TV out of the bedroom.... Hope to see some more posts on this topic.
Thanks for your response!  The article you  "clicked" did help.  I have had it on the "normal" setting but I'll try it for tonight on "sensitive" and see what happens.  I could feel better about about 96% if I get less!
Thanks for sharing this insights @MarreFitbit. Disconnecting from electronic devices is really difficult for me, but I will give it a try. 😋

Hi @Oh2beFIT  sometimes when you feel off balance, it could be your body needs water. Sometimes you could have an inner ear problem, the flu or a number of different conditions happening. If you feel things aren't right, then take note of them and if necessary, get with your health care professional. Only you know what medicines you're taking and which medical issues you're facing. Try sipping on something and see if it helps make you feel better. Hoping you'll soon feel more balanced.

No, there is no alarm for skin temperature.But for the "smart watches", primarily the Versa family, and Sense which is essentially a high end Versa, people can develop their own apps and clock faces.  I myself don't do any such development but from the little I have seen, that seems like something could possibly be done.

hello fitbit, I am unhappy about the new feature of the sleep score.  I purchased the fitbit to monitor my sleep patterns and have been very attached to the weekly average. Suddenly this feature disappeared and was replaced by the sleep score.  It is very discouraging to see something like 'poor' for the sleep score when I am working to improve my sleep patterns. I have no interest in the sleep score and want the weekly sleep average returned. at least if you had a choice about this, that would work better.  Please return my fitbit dashboard to how it was when I purchased it.  thank you!
I  have the same problems. I will take 1 Tablespoon of Nyquil or something for a Nighttime Cold. I don't wake up feeling groggy but rested.
Follow-Up: Another good night's sleep after last meal around 4:20pm and no eating or drinking at all after that. If this is what it takes to not be up ... overnight, it is worth it. Undoubtedly water is involved, but weight is lowering as well. The calories cut from the munchies counts, too. For full disclosure, I've also been walking 10K steps of more most days.
Where you see this sleep efficiency score?
Hello @TZiady. Nice to see you around. 
 
Thank you for the detailed information and for considering the Fitbit Sense. I was able to see that the response from @JohnnyRow, helped to resolve your inquiries.
 
So, at this time, I'd just like to share that the benchmark is based on published data and shows how your sleep stage estimates from the previous night compare to the averages of others who are the same age range and sex (source). In the graph, the typical range for each sleep stage is shown as the shaded area between the two horizontal lines. Keep in mind sleep cycles vary naturally, and you’ll likely see your sleep data fall outside the typical ranges at times. Another way to analyze your sleep stages is to compare your data from last night to your own 30 day average (under the 30 Day Avg tab), as your sleep patterns may vary over time.
 
For more information, I recommend reviewing this link: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
Hope this helps.

How much sleep is considered good vs. the restless that is being logged?
I set my sleep right from my phone.  I go into fitbit, click on sleep, click on the plus sign in the top right hand corner and choose "Begin Sleep Now".  That's it, I;m done!
In August I gave birth to my fourth child in a planned home birth. Everything was going well, however when my son was born he was unresponsive. We spent eight days in the NICU. By the grace of God, our son Gideon is an adorable six month old with four teeth and so full of joy!
 

The NICU stay, mingled with hormones, four children under six years old, running a business and farm and a slew of other responsibilities was a recipe for stress. Because I was postpartum, I knew I had to get help. I reached out to my midwife and told her I was struggling. She said, “When we need help the most it’s the hardest to ask.” Truer words had never been spoken. She referred me to a highly recommended postpartum therapist. 
 
During therapy I discovered that sleep deprivation was one of the biggest contributing factors to the symptoms I was experiencing. I had heard about sleep hygiene in the past, but now it was a matter of necessity. 
 
A friend of mine had gifted me her Fitbit when she upgraded to a newer model. I heard that it could track sleep. So, I started wearing it. I also started walking for the mental health benefits. Every morning I woke up excited to check my sleep score! It was so fun! I also loved learning about the different stages of sleep and which parts helped with mood. 
 
It became a challenge to try to get a high sleep score! Within a month I had gone from scores of 74 to scores of 91. Along with my therapy sessions and the daily walking, my entire attitude and daily outlook had shifted. Life had gone from feeling so hard to light and possible again. 
 
Don’t believe the lie that just because you’re busy or have young kids, or even a newborn, that you can’t get sleep. Sleep doesn’t get enough credit for its restorative properties. There is no substitute for sleep. 
 
I would recommend joining the sleep community for ideas and support. It is possible to get sleep. And the benefits are immediate. Within two nights I could feel and notice improvements in my outlook and energy levels. 
 
Start experimenting. Challenge yourself with sleep scores. One of my favorite sleep hygiene tips is a mug of hot sleepy time tea, fresh clean sheets and diffusing lavender essential oils. Oh, and a 9pm bedtime - who knew that was feasible with four kids? It is!

OK, thanks. I believe with that one the best thing to do is turn off bluetooth on the phone while sleeping. When you turn it on in the morning, it will perform a sync.

I’m glad to see other people are experiencing the same issue. I went to a cardiologist today for an ECG bc I thought my heart rate was spiking (140+) at 1-2am every night. My doctor even prescribed me beta blockers bc of it!!! So yeah this is a big problem. This is reassuring though. The HR chart says it was at 67 at same time the target HR chart said 141.
I do get over 90% efficiency with the setting of "Use Normal Tracker". I am a morning person and majority of the days I wake up refresh and ready for the day. The percentage given by the "Use Sensitive Tracker" setting is what surprises me. I wonderful if I can improve the % or I am within the normal range. Anyone have overnight sleep in the 90 percentile?
I don't clip it to the band at all.  I just shove the fitbit in the pocket without the clip and I'm done.  Never had it fall out.

i think ive found the problem. ive switched it to sensitive, so this means it lirerally tracks when my arm has moved or ive rolledover causing me to be 'restless'swithed it back to normal mode last night and ive had 9 hours sleep, i think sensitive it to sensitive for me im not waking up or aware im moving but its says i am!

Hi @cathm, no I don't see that option anywhere.I've also been told by the support that I do have the latest version of the fitbit app.
Hi @opiatedsherpa! I'm so happy to hear that you are using the Flex tracker and that it has met your expectations in regard to sleep tracking. It seems that you are having a very good sleep quality, however, regarding your question on body rest, this might sound a bit funny but have you checked if your mattress is in good shape? I believe this is super important when it comes to a good night rest. Just saying, it could be an option.  Keep up the good work!

I found this on my Andriod phone but cannot find on Windows 10 even though I tried to follow the instructions.  Has anyone actually found it on Windows, I assume from the dashboard, the only things I can set from the sleep tile are sleep length goal, and manually log sleep.  Does it maybe work only on touch screen mode but not in traditional keyboard mode such as on a desktop?  I think everything else has been accessible from traditional desktop.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I have had a problem lately with remembering to put my FB1 into the wristband and set it for sleep mode. I'm going to put the band on my electric toothbrush handle so that when I get ready for bed and brush my teeth it will be there. Brushing my teeth is the last thing I do before going to bed so it should be a great trigger to get the FB1 set up for sleep mode. Then when I get up and start my day I weigh myself, brush my teeth, get dressed and head out. Put the FB1 back into the clip and I'm ready for the day!
His is the problem I’m having. My oxygen read as 78 last night. But I feel fine, lol. Did you ever get it figured out?
How does fitbit know how much we sleep?  Or when we are sleeping and when we are just laying still?  How accurate is it?
No that’s not it. What I am requesting is for Fitbit to wake me up, using vibration, within 30 min of nap initiation (some times it may take some time to actually fall asleep after I indicate the start of a nap). That would really help people take just the right amount of nap and wake up before disrupting circadian rhythm.As for tracking/logging night sleep of shorter durations, I do not care what’s recommended or not. Many people unfortunately have somewhat fragmented sleep, which should be tracked in totality.
Doctari Welcome, you can create a Custom Activity and I called mine Surge Sleep HR. When you enter the data you will probably find on the PC you will need to enter the calories but on the Android it gives you the calories. Just type the description into the Activity Log view and that will prompt you to create the activity. If you do this analysis for other periods of the day it levels the calories over the time period and you may lose Active Minutes. Here is a sleep example comparing my Charge HR and the Surge @SunsetRunner wrote:I am new (less than 1 week) to Fitbit. I have a Surge and was encouraged by my coworker to get a premium account.  With all that I can't figure out how to get a heart rate plot with an arbitrary start and stop time from the collected data.  I have looked in the main website client, and in the Android app, and although I have heart rate graphs for defined exercise sessions, I can't find a way to show them for sleep sessions, or for any arbitrary time period, e.g. sitting in meetings, etc.  Please point the way for me.  A thousand thanks.

thanks, I actually don't have the other tracker in the house at all.  I sold it when I got this one so I doubt it's still sinking.  as I mentioned in the other post, it's only happened once so I'm just gonna see what happens. thanks for your suggestion...
I have/had severe sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine.  I can not read the sleep patterns on the CPAP and compare to what I see on the Force sleep patterns but what I would say is the sleep clinic has the correct means to diagnose sleep apnea, not the fitbit device.  Maybe if you had not had your diagnosis and the fitbit what showing a lot of sleep disruptions, it would send you to the sleep clinic.  For me, the apnea events were severe and frequently I woke up with dibilitating headaches.   The CPAP has been a life saver..truly.  I've lost 100lbs since the diagnosis and I probably don't have as severe of a case, but I'm still using the CPAP.  Eventually after I lose my last 30lbs, I'll go back and get retested. Short answer - don't be lulled into a false sense of security if the fitbit doesn't register apnea events.  That's not what it is designed for.
Thank you for your response. Sadly there’s nowhere else in our house that I could sleep, because believe me, I would if I could!!!!Sent from my iPhone
Beware. I was interested so followed your link. Advocare contains lavender. I did an intolerance test and it says that I am intolerant to lavender. I had long heard that lavender helped sleep and in the past had bought some to spray on my bedding. It did not help me. I guess the intolerance test shows the reason why.
I sleep so hardly and only a small trigger is needed to wake me up and then I can't sleep for a long while. I wish I could sleep better. A small sound, movement, a nightmare, having to go to the washroom, the cold, the warmth, anything can break my sleep.
Hi my Inspire 2 has been automatically logging sleep details since I got it 3 weeks ago but has stopped the past two nights. Any idea why?
Thanks. I can get the basics, but it does not appear that benchmarks are available on my laptop. I have found them on my cell, so that’ll do.S.
In addition to what @kawaiiko mentioned, which is all good, if the tracker loses the heart rate signal during the night, it won't register deep or REM. The next time it happens, take a look at the screen when you click on that night's rest. It will often tell you if there's a problem and what it is. Mine is usually losing heart rate signal, from wearing it too loosely.

Moderator edit: subject updated for clarity
Fans and/or AC are on all night, @BraulioFitbit.
I first had a Fitbit Versa and now a Versa 2 and the situation is the same in both instances. My typical sleep times are from around 23:30 to about 06:30 or 07:00. Almost every night my Fitbit shows that I slept for an hour or two and then that I only slept again after about anything from one to three hours later. It does not show it as awake time, but as two separate sleep sessions. In most cases I am not aware of being awake during that time at all and therefor doubt it it is true. Do you have any explanation for this?
The report for the past three days are typical of most days:
Today: 00:04 - 03:06 and again 04:28 - 07:09
Yesterday: 23:38 - 00:41 and again 03:20 - 06:49

I don't want to write a long story so I'll keep it short. I was tired all the time and had some other issues, especially in the morning, like headaches and trouble concentrating. I would usually really wake up around noon.My doctor said it was stress/burnout.I bought a Fitbit because I wanted to exercise more and lose some weight to see if that would work (male, 39, bmi:25, 22% bodyfat).My Fitbit said my SPO2 fluctuated a lot during the night with almost every night high peaks.Asked my doctor for a sleep studySleep study diagnosed me with heavy sleep apnea: 33 respiratory arrests per hour. Now I have a cpap device to help me sleep.Normal: First night with cpap: Another thing that changed is my bodytemperature. It was 1.6 degrees lower than normal. Need more data to see if that's a lasting change due to the cpap. I've read that the thyroid lowers your bodytemperature for the deep sleep phase and respiratory arrest could prevent that (which makes you sweat more during sleep).
This is the first time I've had HRV readings, the old fitbit didn't have this capability. I'm not sure what to make of it.Get Outlook for Android<>
It is very frustrating!   With Jawbone it worked perfectly but since they went out of business several of us switched to FitBit which is a better product so it sucks that this feature does not work.  You would think they could master this feature but so far no luck.
Yes some days it can be a real challenge!
A link to my feature request as asked for:  Graph to show when we get to REM Regards Chris
Yes, Yesterday it only tracked half my sleep and today apparently I slept zero hours.. 😒
I've wondered the same thing.  When the recommendations, though perhaps unofficial, were made,  most people had no way of knowing how much of bed time was actual sleep; so I wonder if 8 hours was actually considered 8 hours in bed, perhaps minus time when you were obviously awake such as from insomnia. I rarely see 8 hours mentioned now.  It seems more common to see 7-8 or even 6-8 being mentioned; perhaps that is why.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I found the article to be very helpful.
Usually fitbit subtracts time awake from the time in bed to give you the actual sleep time. I noticed today and yesterday it is not subtracting the time I have been awake. For example if I am in bed for 8 hours and restless/awake for 30 minutes, it should say my actual sleep time is 7 hours 30 min. Now, it is saying my actual sleep time is 8 hours. How do I fix this?
I just set my sleep settings to sensitive.  Will see tomorrow if that changes the results.

I assume it is based on how long you are awake, although I suppose it could look at steps too.  If it is too long (I don't know what that time would be), it will break it into separate sleep segments.  If that happens, sometimes you can edit your sleep log to treat it all as one sleep.

Anyone know how to export my sleep logs? I'd like to show my doctor. Come to think of it, my heart rate  logs would be useful to show her as well. I did a search of this site, no love. I have a Versa 2.
I always felt my left hand was my dominant, although in school i was taught to write with my right hand. I do everything else left handed; ie throw a ball, etc. So...which hand is my dominant hand?ma
Hey @Choreo did you see @betpchem's reply? 
 
She is correct in telling you that the movement of your tracker is mainly what constitutes "asleep time." As she mentioned, when you're reading in bed, you're likely still moving about, and not as still as you would be if you were sleeping. This movement while reading is how your tracker still knows you're awake, and when this movement stops as you fall asleep, this is when sleep recording starts.
 
I hope this clears things up, and please let me know if I can answer any further questions!

Hi, WavyDavey, and thanks for your questions. My sleep log goes back to April of 2017. I realized that I could actually drill down if I kept hitting the "Load more" link (previously unnoticed at the bottom of the screen) many, many times to get back to June 2017. I was able to find the information that I was looking for. Thank you, again.
Lavender does it for me. I have an essential oil blend that has lavender, and it really helps me sleep well.
That was the issue.  I never had any notes below the graph, just basic sleep data or a sleep score on random days.I can confirm that the feature was removed as I now have a dialog box on the main sleep page stating that I need to join Fitbit Premium to see details about my sleep.This is very disappointing as I feel I was mislead into purchasing my device which I have only had for a couple of months. It's probably too late to return the device but it will definitely be my last purchase from Fitbit and right now 3 of my 4 family members have Fitbit's with the fourth having a Garmin.  That won't be the case going forward.
Hi @astair Moved your post from the Charge HR to the Improve your Zzzs section since being more relevant to the topic and increase the chance of getting a solution. Wishing a wonderful day
I would really love a 'smart' alarm that tries and wakes you up in a moment of light sleep. Some people report great success with such alarms. Any plans to implement something like that for the Fitbit? Is there any 3rd party app that does it? Thanks!
It'd be great if you can come back to tell us how did it go @philchenevert ! 😊

I cannot answer your question. However, my fiance is a sleep specialist. He said the sleep data from fitbit does't tell anything if you want to take it serious with your sleep issue. One of his patients has severe sleep apnea but the sleep data from fitbit says he has over 95% of rest time.I don't have any sleep issue. I just use the data from fitbit to make sure that I have enough sleep hours each day.
A friend and I both just got our year end stats emailed to us.  Am I to believe that he and I sleep the exact same number of minutes, at the exact same average time, with the exact same minutes of deep sleep, REM sleep etc?  EVERY STAT WAS IDENTICAL!  What time we get up in the morning? Same minute on average for a YEAR?  Really Fitbit? I am throwing the BS flag!!  The steps seemed believable, but this just makes the whole Fitbit program look HORRIBLE!  I really want the better heart rate monitor that Apple offers.  Now it appears that the sleep stats are total BS.  Anybody know if the difference in the newest Apple is worth any extra $ vs last years model?
Well, mine's been off recently from catching bronchitis. But there's a lot of things you can do to improve your deep sleep. Check the stickied thread up above I started for tips from other Fitbit users.

If you go to your profile and set it up to show your sleep efficiency. Then you have to set the sleep monitor on your Flex by tapping it until it vibrates. Then two lights will flash and toggle back and forth. That is sleep mode.When you make up, tap it until it vibrates again then you are back to active mode. Once you sync, it will show your sleep.Hope this helps.

I agree. I've downloaded and used Sleep Cycle alarm clock from the App Store, and yes, it does work very well. I just don't like the fact that I'm sleeping on my phone (which you are told to place under your pillow), that's plugged into the charger, that eventually overcharges the phone. (I usually don't charge my phone overnight.) It just doesn't feel right, so I've stopped using that app.  I'd love that feature to come to fitbit.

It happens sometimes; I wonder if I'm tapping it in my sleep. Just log it on the sleep log page. fitbit.com/sleep
My Fitbit says I consistently get over 25% REM sleep.
My sleep tracking time is being weird. I once went to bed at 9:33 PM and woke up at 4;55 AM, and it said that I got 7 hours 7 minutes of sleep. Anyone else finding that problem?
@Calathea77: sorry to hear about your medical condition, and thanks for all the insight you provided. My understanding is the idea behind using large safety goggles is they could fit on top of existing glasses (for people wearing prescription glasses, like me).

Thank you for your comments. I believe you are right @SunsetRunner, at that time when I was experiencing these episodes of paralysis, I was under a lot of stress due to a tragedy it happened in my family. 
 
So I agree with you, exercise its a great stress reliever. Its great how much benefit you can have from being active, because at that time I was feeling tired, even when I was not doing any type of exercise. Now that I spend almost 3 hrs in the gym, Instead of feeling tired and sleepy, I feel a lot better and with more energy.

Putting aside whether skin temperature is an effective proxy for body temperature for my purposes, does the temperature-triggered alarm functionality that i described exist? I don't mind taking a bit of a shot in the dark on the skin temperature thing, as my plan B right now is buying a USB IR camera and writing something myself to interpret the feed, which would take me months.
Not sure if this directly affects what you are saying, but sleep is always credited to the day you wake up, so I suppose generally yes it is added to the night before, though you might be able to concoct a case where that was not the case, especially for night shift workers where is gets complicated.

Looking at my chart I seem to go straight from awake to deep sleep as soon as I go to bed at night. Is this normal? I don’t stay in deep sleep and generally have less than average time there but just thought it strange that every night I don’t seem to go through stages to get todeep sleep, I just go there instantly.
Hello @anaximenes, @stillc Welcome to the community forums! @stillc Thank you very much for your input and I'm glad to see you around! 
 
@anaximenes Your time asleep is calculated by subtracting your time spent awake and restless from your overall tracked sleep time. For example, if you slept 8 hours but woke up 2 times for 15 minutes each, your time asleep would be 7 hr 30 min.

How and when do you remove it? I usually get out of bed, walk over to the dresser, and then take it off before my shower.  Never had a problem with the tracking.
Well @Rosettaw1 they where not forced apon the user, but added as a response to a much requested suggestion by the Fitbit users, yes fitbit responds to suggestions. We do have a feature suggestion to make this optional. Make sleep score optional

I’ve tried white noise, @BraulioFitbit.  It’s nice but … soothing, solo piano works best for me. I recently underwent a medical procedure where I could not be deeply sedated. The anesthesiologist was apologizing for that. But I told her that if she will just play my preferred music in the OR, I would be fine. She did. I was.
I’ve learned that eating later in the evening will result in restless sleep. Even drinking anything but water or a nice cup of decaf tea will affect my sleep. What helps me fall asleep faster and seems to result in a more restful sleep is Fitbit’s Relax feature. I do the 5 minute session in bed to clear my mind. Relax is a controlled, deep breathing exercise. It’s almost like meditation. Works for me. One of my granddaughters was so very anxious about the SAT test that it kept her up at night. I showed her how to use Relaxion as she went thru the test study guides, urging her to use it before studying, then after studying to clear her mind. I also urged her to use it again before going to sleep. She said it was a big help.
Typically a person goes through a 90 minute cycle. So each 90 minutes you begin a new cycle. This cycle includes all the stages. On my fitbit chart I see a 'blip' about every 90 minutes which means I am at the point in my cycle where I am closest to being awake and I move a bit. I am not awake, but I roll over or move my arms or whatever. I regularly get 95-97% sleep with 1-3 awake periods in a 6.5 hour time period.
This has been very frustrating for me and my friends as well.  No matter what we do our sleep data does not automatically share with each other.  We loved Jawbone UP bands for that feature but Jawbone is basically out of business.  Wish Fitbit would work this feature out!!!
Thank you so much for your response.  I have a Versa3 (not Sense as stated) so my charger does not have the  button you  mentioned.  Just removed the app from my phone and reinstalled; hoping that will  resolve the problem.  Happy Holidays!
Good morning, I use a Charge 3 and recently noticed the addition of a blood oxygen variation graph in my sleep data. I've been googling a bit but am unsure how to interpret it. Can someone help? Unfortunately, I'm unable to include a picture, but I'll try to explain as best I can. The x-axis is clearly for time, but what about the y-axis? There's a line about halfway up where labels say "large" above it and "small" below it (my translation; I use the app in Swedish). The graph legend also states that a green line indicates small variations, while yellow marks bigger variations, so that's also pretty self-explanatory. My graph is almost entirely green every night, but it's fairly low on the chart. Does this mean my Charge 3 estimates I have a fairly low level of blood oxygen, but with small variations? The few times the graph has been yellow, it's been to form a peak rather than a trough. Thanks in advance.

Sounds like a bug to me too. I would contact support to let them know of your issues.
I am late to this thread, but I know that REM sleep is important for memory consolidation and that there is actually a positive correlation between REM sleep and IQ, nonetheless, a balanced sleep will always be best I suppose, personally I have very high % of REM sleep but rather little deep sleep, it could be a fun study to compare a lot of people like us to see the expression of low REM / high deep and high REM/low deep in everyday life 🙂
Hi there @dallasdoesfit. I'm not sure how is the symbol you're describing. Where did you see it? You can find some symbols in this page depending what Fitbit you're wearing.

I have had a Fitbit since Sept. 12, 2022 and I have worked hard to increase my sleep to 8+ hours per night.  For several months, my watch would say I should wear my Fitbit to bed (I have always wore it to bed) or that it can't do a profile because I didn't get 14 nights of 8+ sleep in during the month.  Well, in January 2023, I got 21 nights of 8+ sleep.  Still, I don't get a sleep profile.  Yes, I can open up the hours slept on the app on my android phone or PC and see when I got up to use the restroom or was restless and time that I was asleep but I do not get a profile of my sleep stages.  I am extremely disappointed over this and figure I must be doing something wrong.  I bought my Fitbit in Sept. and it is a Versa 2.  Does anyone have any ideas? On a side note, I have lost 57 pounds since Sept. 12th with the assistance of the Fitbit and getting my exercise and diet in line with my goals.  I believe the device has truly changed my lifestyle for the better. Fitbit folks - keep up the good work.  Let’s see more advances in the software.

You need to know WHY you aren't sleeping well. It might be something as simple as you need a new mattress/pillow. Or maybe you need to use 'breathe right' strips to help open your nose so you can breathe better. Or maybe it is more serious and you have sleep apnea. Talk to a dr and have a sleep test done. Then you will know WHY this is happening and you can decide what you want to do about it. There are meds out there that aren't addictive or problematic if they are right for you.
I had my watch off for a bit yesterday night, from about 6/7 PM to give my wrist and watch a rest. I put it back on at 10:45 when I went to bed. Woke up this morning and it seemed to have tracked my time asleep the whole time it was off and my time asleep but didn’t actually track any of my sleep zones. I deleted the tracking from my day since it was so thrown off. Anyone else experience this? Now I’m nervous to leave my watch off for an extended period of it’s going to mess with the sleep tracking.
The "Estimated Oxygen Variation" feature is available now on Fitbit Charge 3, Fitbit Charge 4, Fitbit Ionic, and Fitbit Versa series. See: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1876/ In that help file it says: "To receive EOV data, note the following:Make sure your Fitbit device is snug and secure before you go to sleep. For more information, see How do I wear my Fitbit device?Make sure your Fitbit device is charged.You must have Charge 3, Charge 4, Ionic, or a Versa series device. You must sleep 3 or more hours. "
Hello! I've been recently using my fitbit charge to track my sleep and thought I had a normal sleep schedule until I've been reading other threads and started to get a bit worried if I should consult a doctor.  Here's a few pictures to show my sleep: http://imgur.com/a/pHy11 I'm not necessarily waking up through the night but my restless sleep counts (per night) can reach up from 10-25. I've been trying to get 8 hours of sleep but even if I'm sleeping for 8 hours, my actual time of sleep is never more than 5 hours. I wake up very tired and can barely function throughout the day. I've been avoiding naps for the past few weeks but I'm constantly very very tired. Any tips to get more sleep or how to fix my sleep?

Is there a way to bring back the weekly sleep average? As a shift worker this was more helpful with my sleep patterns than the new sleep score is.
What does x mean restless x9  asleep x32?
Here's another example from today:What I'm asking for is the ability to select and delete that fifteen minutes of REM sleep that didn't actually happen (because I was awake that whole time), so that one continuous period of sleeplessness is what the data shows. Alternatively, it might be a good idea to add some specific parameters to the sleep sensitivity settings, instead of just being sensitive or normal.  I'd like to be able to increase the amount of time one must lie still before the device considers one to be asleep. And, once again, I'm requesting that the mods move this thread to the the "Feature Suggestions" subforum.  I'm not interested in tricks that might fool the existing system into providing slightly better data (I've tried them, and the quality of this data is still poor); I'd like to help improve it for everyone.
Read your sleep suggestions.  They are very practical and should help.  Read Reply 13 of 13 for something not on your list which works for me.  Why it works, I do not know.  But I do offer a suggestion for its usefulness, at least to me.
I try not to be on my phone or laptop within a half hour of going to sleep! This usually helps me. @Emamino88 wrote:Anyone have occasional restless nights when you're trying to fall asleep? What tips and tricks do you use to "clear" your mind??
I called them the other day to ask about the new sleep app because I don't have mine yet.  I was told I'd have it soon.  A friend of mine who has the same FitBit as me (Charge2) already has the new sleep app so I emailed them to ask again.  In the meantime, those of you have it (the new sleep chart), how is it working?  From what I understand, it's supposed to be more sophisticated because it uses HR in addition to movement to track the sleep stages.
See this help section:What should I know about sleep stages?particularly the section "What does each stage mean?" Different stages have different purposes. Greatly simplified, deep sleep is for the body, REM sleep is for the mind. Thinking of food, your question is something like, which is better 10 grams of fiber or 20 grams of protein?  There's no answer - you need them both.

Any ideas when sleep score will be available to everyone?
Well I can't figure out how to unaccept this solution, or post pictures or delete a post. I tried to paste a link to facebook where I posted a screen shot of my sleep chart and this came up.
15 to 20 awakes is pretty normal. Usually we don't remember them because they're so short.

I think because I am so restless when I am awake it reads my sleep pretty accurately... but if I lay on the couch reading or watching TV - it will say I was asleep. so I move around a bit when I am truly awake so it reads it more accurately.

I work 3am-12pm and absolutely love my shift; it unfortunately makes it difficult for me to find other jobs because I prefer midnights so much. I sleep one of two ways: from 7pm to 2am or 1pm to 8pm
I would really like it if there would be an hook up with "sleep as an droid" .With that a reminder could be sent to the fitbit when to go to sleep.The fitbit would tell sleep as an droid when the user is asleep and awake.Also could tell with the sensors when the rem sleep and deep sleep are there, please also use the heart rate sensor.The user could be awakened with the fitbit when the user is almost awake and it is almost the time for the alarm.
Hi,  My fitbit tracker consistently shows that I do only light sleep after 6am, does that mean I should start waking up at 6 am? I usually wake up around 8 am and sleep about 6 to 7 hours a day, so if I start waking up early it will cut my overall sleep really short. Thanks!
Thank you
I also have a low HR during sleep, low 40’s. During the day its usually around 58bpm. I am also wondering if this all started from too much cardio running.
This might help a lot of LEFT handed and AMBIDEXTROUS people. In either case put the fitbit on your right hand and use as dominant hand and you will get much more accurate readings. REASONING: Regardless of our handedness we live in a right handed world. 99% of all doors open to the right handed advantage. Even rifridurators leave the factory opening from the right. The controls in your car are all on the right. (in the US) Laptop Keyboard delet, return, arross, punctuation is all on the right side.  You may be Lefty or Ambi but the world we live in is for the Right handed.
Hello @Pksrowland37 It's great to see you around! @JohnnyRow I'm glad to see you around and thanks for your great input! 
 
@Pksrowland37 Thank you for the detailed information! It's very odd since you've mentioned that you've received details about REM, Light, and Deep Sleep Data. As @JohnnyRow mentioned, while using this option, your Sleep Stages should not be received. For more information, I recommend visiting this help article: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
On a side note, I've noticed that you inquired about "Awake" on this thread and you have received information. Please note that for future reference, I recommend creating a single thread for each question. This way confusion can be avoided. 
See you around.

Hey @dave_in_ni ! We're in the same situation, I have to start my day at 3 AM 😵.
 
On my days Off I feel upset because I would like to sleep more. Normally, the night before I go to bed later, almost always I watch a movie that will keep me awake. I'm awake at 3 but because I went to bed later I still feeling sleepy and after 30 min I can sleep again. Of course this does not happen every time so when I can't back to sleep I get up and I take a nap later. 
 
If someone knows a solution I really would like to heart it too!

I bought the Fitbit Charge 2 for the Sleep Stages recording ( Awake, REM, Light, Deep )...It worked fine for the first 2 weeks till last Thursday.Then it only showed Sleep Patterns which is not useful for me. I checked my settings to see if anything had changed, but no, all was the same.So I contacted online support. 'Pablo' was very helpful at support. He checked my account setup and after a bit of a chat, offered a solution to try.I'm happy to say the solution did work. Sunday nights sleep was back to showing Sleep Stages. To fix my Charge 2, I had to put it onto the charger and then do a reset on the device. To reset whilst on charge, you need to press the button on the Charge 2 in for about 4 seconds . This will be confirmed by the Fitbit symbol appearing on screen with a vibration. And then it's done. Just leave on charge for a couple of hours.I was worried I would lose all previous info, but that was no problem. All OK.
Previous implementation made this unnecessary benchmark buried at the very end of your sleep stats and it was easy to ignore it. I don't even remember when I saw it last time. Not with this sleep score though, which is very much in-your-face. Now, if you don't want to be judged and graded, you have to remove the sleep tile altogether, making the device mush less useful. And you know what usually happens with useless devices? They usually end up in the trash can and never upgraded. And the manufacturers of useless devices usually go out of business.
You have the same problem as I do!  I could always fall asleep given the chance yet I can sleep for 8 hours but still only get 20 minutes deep sleep!  My children have long since grown up @And left home so that isn’t the reason!
@Meganmx33, Can you post a screenshot of the heart rate chart from one of the nights where it couldn't calculate sleep stages?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
I read scientific literature to help me sleep better. It's boring and I fall asleep quickly
I have always experienced excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, vivid dreams, sleep disruption, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea some time ago, although have never been able to adjust to the CPAP. My sleep doctor didn’t do the MSLT and I’m not sure why. I need to go back and see if they can do it, because I am positive I have narcolepsy! I’m not sure how to post a photo here, but I’m interested to know what others who have narcolepsy think of my sleep reports. Thanks!

I just tried to share a screenshot from the app twice using the “share” feature, and it’s not showing up, not sure why.

Hello @Gwenniepennie. Welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thank you for the information. Please make sure that the Fitbit App is updated to the latest version. For more information, please visit the following links: What's changed in the latest release of the Fitbit app? and How do I use the Fitbit app?. 
Also, take into consideration that in order for you to receive a Sleep Score, you should receive Sleep Stages. Please consider the following: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?. 
 
On a side note, I recommend performing a restart to your Fitbit device. You can get instructions about how to perform this, by visiting this link: 
How do I restart my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps.

I am concerned with my sleep efficiency. According to my fitbit one i average 40% efficiency. Can this be wrong?
I only have two days of sleep logged so far but I have 91%
I have tried so many things to get better sleep but nothing works. I average 10% REM and 10% Deep sleep. Often I am getting less then this. I have mild sleep apnea but that doesn't seem to be the problem because I am not waking up during my sleep cycle often, I just don't seem to cycle from deep to REM. As soon as I put my watch on my wife she get like 20-25 % Deep and 20-25% REM. I can't seem to find any information other then apnea as a cause, but I have tried CPAP, Mouth peice, THC, Melatonin, sleeping pills, removing tonsils and fixing deviated septum. What else can I try? Here is my fitbit tracker.
What should I look for? Heart rate monitor?Any specific sensors I should look for?Smartwatch or Fitness tracker?My goal : Sleep tracking, Heart rate (all day), Respiration Rate (all day), (plus any health metrics I can get)Your perspective and recommendation will be much appreciated.
So SleepNumber have access to the fitbit data. But Fitbit doesn't have access to Sleep Number data? Since I have connected my Fitbit account to my sleep number app. Since it would be nice to have access to all your sleep data in FitBit and how you can improve as it knows more about what you eat, drink, and do.
It may also be a tell for disease later on. With long term sleep trends... you can understand depression or another illness by subsequent changes in sleep patterns. There are lots of interesting things we can learn and we are just scratching the tip with what we will be able to find out.
Hi @FredBloggs Welcome to the forums. Yes, sometimes if you are still for a long period of time and your heart rate is steady, your Fitbit will track it as sleep. I occasionally have that happen when I attend long meetings (always fun to tell the meeting organizer later that the meeting was a dud because Fitbit thought I was a sleep. LOL). You can edit your tracked sleep to remove your movie time to have a more accurate representation of your sleep time. How was the movie?

I remember most of my dreams, but I think the one that I'll always remember because it was so vivid. Actually, it made me worried about myself for a bit, I had a dream that I had walked into a warehouse for a party and when I got there, everyone had been brutally murdered. Not just like, stabbed or whatnot, like actually cut up into pieces, bit by bit. There was one person who was still alive and all she had left was her head and her torso, bleeding out and she told me they had all been cut up while alive and conscious still. When I woke up I was like "wow what is wrong with me". I also used to have dreams about work, all. the. time.
I have found that a good bit of the time I am awake is recorded by the Blaze as light sleep. One evening I recorded the time I work up and a time about two hours later during which I did not sleep. The Blaze recorded all but a couple of minutes of that as light sleep. I was wide awake. Any way the accuracy can be improved?
Stick to a sleep schedule. Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. ...Pay attention to what you eat and drink. Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. ...Create a restful environment. Keep your room cool, dark and quiet. ...Limit daytime naps. ...Include physical activity in your daily routine. ...Manage worries.

hello everyone , can anyone suggests how to improve the resting bpmearlier mine wan 60 but within a month it has reached to 69
I get up several times a night to use the bathroom, and it never records it as "awake."  It always just says restless...but as the other poster pointed out, I try to move as little as possible when I do get up, so I guess it's not enough for it to feel like I'm awake.
Great suggestions @Glenda
I agree, it's worthless the way it  is.
@marynotsleeping Can you describe the uncertainty you've encountered with sleep tracking? I'm sure that the community can offer you insight or assistance.
 
You may want to check this help article for sleep tracking instructions.
And this article can describe some of the finer points of the sleep tracking data that you'll see.
Fitbit takes into account your basal metabolic rate (BMR) which is the calories your body burns just by being alive.
^^^^^. Exactly what he said. I am also a Respiratory therapist and a Registered Polysomnography Tech.Fitbit will not diagnose sleep apnea. Please see your physician if your sleep is affecting your daily activities.
I don' even get that far - my Charge 2 doesn't bother recording the sleep at all.
@tkcornbred I recommend reviewing the sleep record on the online Dashboard here to confirm if the sleep record is showing the same as on your mobile device.

Fitbit will then establish a time period of inactivity and it "assumes" you are asleep and any movements it detects are interpreted as "wakes" and "unrest", not steps. So when you sync you have your sleep pattern. There is no need to log the sleep hours because they should be there after your sync provided you tapped.

I completely agree with Guy_. When I take coffee or strong tea at night then I can't sleep.
Thank you, will try that!
Did you use the begin sleep now command?
@ARoe The sleep log appears on the sleep tile, any chance the tile is hidden? Check out the Fitbit Article: URL: How do I change my dashboard on the Fitbit app for iOS?
I'm not trying to be  jerk. What are the advantages of tracking sleep? The main reason I'm asking is that I find it annoying to wear my Charge HR all night. But if there is a strong reason to wear it then I can try to get used to it.

Thank you!!! I just got my FitBit this weekend and this morning I went back to bed after my kids left for school. I wanted the Blaze specifically because of my sleep issues. I had gotten less than five hours of sleep last night. I was thinking I was just going to have a time log, but was pleasantly surprised that it still had all of the awake/restless information as well. My mattress has a vibrate mode and I was afraid that had thrown it off. But now knowing this, not a problem!
I'm sorry that no one responded until now.  My background is physiology and agree that this graph is very confusing.  But the explanation that "high variations can be linked to breathing issues" seems to indicate a lower than normal oxygen level.  I think it's a little over dramatic to say "not enough" when the graph has no values attached to it.

Hi !!! Have a look here (https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/More-functional-sleep-data-analysis/idi-p/1195744). Here are more reasons to track you sleep.
@WavyDavey Thanks! In my business we create our own benchmarks from historical data. I think people are taking these as "good" but they're just "average".
laughing was not a very professional way for your doctor to react. minelooked at the printouts, made no real comment, put them in my file. i willkeep printing them and letting him keep them in the file. there is toomuch time between tests and visits for him to understand my sleep patterns(in my opinion) and i believe that the printouts will show patterns thatintermittent sleep tests and office visits won't show. you'll find itinteresting to see what, if any, patterns emerge and maybe, in time, yourdoctor will take your printouts seriously. best of luck. G.
So I have a  question  because I use Google website for the fitbit app since I don't have the actual app do you think anyone can tell me how to navigate  everything on here using  google also can someone  help me navigate on how to find and join groups from this page
i cant get my brand new fit bit to go into sleep mode
I got up 2 nights ago, sat and read in the living room for 2 hours, apparently with my left hand (wearing flex) motionless most of the time. That time was logged as sleep. But, in general, I think over time, flex records sleep fairly well.
Do you know if you level is set on normal or sensitive that can make a difference
Hello, I was just wondering why only my total sleeping hours is displayed on the tiles on my online account. On the app there is more detail - the sleep score and details of when I was in light sleep, REM and deep sleep. Ideally I would like to find a way of exporting all the time related graphical information for how I am sleeping every night. Thanks. 🙂
I have changed the day, and on the days where I felt particularlly awful in the morning, knowing I didn't get ANY sleep whatsoever the normal setting has me getting over 9 hours of sleep. The sensitive setting has me at 3 hours of sleep. There is too much of a discrepancy for me to believe either one.
Hi @Marmcharm What type of tracker do you have? I’d you have a tracker that doesn’t monitor heart rate, it doesn’t have any way to know that it is sitting on a desk verses being on your arm while you are sleeping. Small vibration, like a forced air furnace blowing near it could show slight movement while on a desk, thus replacing sleep movement.

@SleepForFit, thank you for this info!  I wasn’t aware of this beta feature, I have now activated it.
I'm pretty sure that is not how the settings work. I believe that the nights you go to bed with the tracker in sensitive mode, then the output will be 'sensitive' graphs and the nights that you go to bed with the tracker in normal mode, then the output will be 'normal' graphs.
It didn't take many weeks of recording my sleep patterns to notice a trendl.  Overall my sleep is typically really good (90%) except if I eat late in the evening or drink anything 'stronger' than water.
My sleep efficiency is registering as 100%, 4 out of the past 7 nights... Dashboard clearly shows my 10-14 awake periods, however the sleep efficiency is still 100%. This has just started happening. Any suggestions?  -Callahan-

I am experiencing the same problem. Since yesterday, for the first time ever, my sleep is not showing in the app. Let me know if you find the solution for this.
I agree. Mine is still not working either. I assumed when they said it was resolved, it was! But after waking up a short while ago (I reside in China so may be ahead of most people time-wise), there were still no sleep patterns showing, rather only the length of time I had been asleep. This feature was one of the main reasons I purchased this Fitbit Alta. It was working fine up to about 5 days ago, and I have been doing nothing different from when all was well. Hmm.
I passed out and it shows a grey section for around 30 mins on flex2, I'm still unsure wether I might have knocked my self out when collapsing, has this ever happened to anyone?

Good suggestions I’ll let you know what happensSent from my iPhone
I have some serious sleeping issues, just made a post about it. Staying a sleep is an issue, though recently I've found a way to get to sleep really easily. I use a white noise generator :). Might sound a bit weird, but it really works. Used to take me half an hour to an hour to fall asleep, with the white noise takes me maybe 5-10 minutes.
I just purchased my fitbit flex. I input my wake time as pm instead of am, so it says I slept 22 hours (I wish!!). Can I delete that sleep time and reinput? Thanks for any help
I have a fitbit3 and it does the same thing... continually says sleep notrecorded but if I go into the sleep stats it gives me them!! not happy withthis device at all
I'm no expert, but I don't know that that's a healthy solution. I use aromatherapy oils for trying to sleep, and it seems to help. During the drier months, I use a humidifier, and the noise of the motor is akin to white noise, so that helps.
Hello everyone According to the Fitbit app, I slept for 10 hours and 4 minutes and was restless 13 times overnight, so why am I more tired than when I sleep around 8 hours please? I've got dark circles under my eyes and they get bigger and darker the more I sleep.  My prescription decides how long I sleep for so I have very little control over it, but why do I feel more awake and energetic when I have less sleep??  Does anyone know pretty please? Thank you!

My sleeping heart rate is higher than my resting heart rate 80-90% of the night but I’m not having any big variations in my oxygen levels. My restoration score is always low because of my heart rate. Does anyone know what causes a high heart rate at night if it’s not sleep apnea?
Yours are all in the green zone. Mine spike to the yellow zone a few times a night. I don’t have any sleep apnea symptoms.Thanks for sharing yours too (everyone who did)! Now looking at the date of this conversation was 6 mos. ago, but I’m grateful to see the comparisons.
So far moving it to the other arm at night seems to be working. I have frozen shoulder on one side and somehow that makes the fitbit slide down until it cuts the circulation off.

what is the best unit to track sleep?
Thanks fo the article, but tracking sleep is not the issue as I have been tracking sleep since i first got the device. The issue is that through experimentation, my sleep tracking will not return from "sensative" to "normal" sleep tracking.  I can change it manually each day, but I'm hoping to reset to Normal on an everyday basis. Can anyone help? Thanks
I didn’t wear my Fitbit last night because I was charging it.  I checked the “How did I sleep” section in the morning.  It showed my (supposed) sleep patterns for the previous night!  How could this possibly be?!  This makes me doubt the veracity of the entire sleep section, if not the whole Fitbit accuracy!!!  I hope I can get an answer to this!!

Lots of things can cause low energy throughout the day.  How are your vitamin D and iron levels?  Do you have any medical conditions like hypothyroidism which affect your energy levels?  Has the quality of your sleep changed?  Are you keeping a consistent bedtime?  Do you have caffeine and refined sugar throughout the day?  If so what types and how much?   Try measuring your blood pressure, resting heart rate, and percent oxygen saturation as these can also highlight any problems you're having.
I've had the Charge 2 for about two weeks now, and only on two occasions have the new format sleep graphs been generated. Last night I tried having the band a bit tighter, as I thought this would ensure that my heart rate would be monitored more reliably, but still the old format appeared.Not quite sure what to make of it.
I have sleep apnoea  and I noticed the same thing when I had Premium. It was very noticeable that on the rare occasion my sleeping heart rate was below my resting heart rate for about 75% of the night, I felt amazing the following day. The amount of sleep I had didn't make much difference at all. Is it possible you have sleep apnoea?
Great information @WilsonFitbit, thanks for sharing those details. I need to improve my memory, it might be helpful. 😉

I'm confused as to how the sleep score works--I've read the article but still baffled. I slept over 8 hrs the other day and scored "poor"/56...the only thing I can think of was there was a longer period of being awake, but wouldn't have thought it'd affect the overall rating that significantly. Any thoughts?
I have been watching the conversation and aligning it with my own experience.  I would offer this up to anyone trying to make sense of the Sleep Tracking function of Fitbit.  It would seem that the issue is with how the status of sleep is labled.  Looking at WebMd or any site that describes the sleep cycle there is clearly a deep sleep "non REM" as well as the more well known REM cycle of sleep.  My experience suggests that the "no movement" Blue portion of Fitbits monitoring aligns with deep sleep (or NonRem) portion of the sleep cycle.   The red bars align with what would be considered REM sleep - where the muscles are active but the body is still asleep.  This is what Fitbit has labled as "awake" which I suggest is misleading.  In fact it is understandable that a device such as the fitbit would not be able to distinguish from Rem sleep or from being truly away - it is only based on motion.    As such I personally am only focusing on the blue portion which should be an indicaiton of deep sleep and for which only a relatively small portion of the nights sleep is actually expected.  At least for me, I certainly do not feel that the "awake" portion actually aligns to when a person is awake during the evening and as such is misleading.
Hi, can I ask how low your SPO2 was and if the oxygen makes any difference?
My Fitbit luxe has done the same. It was working fine and tracking my sleep and then stopped as I had to reset the device.
I know that a lot of you like to compare your sleep patterns to others' so you can see if your sleep is in the normal range. A lot of you suspect that you may have a sleeping disorder such as Narcolepsy or Hypersomnia. From what I've read, experts believe that there are many people suffering with undiagnosed sleeping disorders, so don't be afraid to bring this up to your physician, and advocate for yourself. My primary care physician initially just thought I was tired because I had four small children. Fortunately (well, in terms of getting a diagnosis is was fortunate), I was suffering from some other symptoms that pointed to more of a sleeping disorder as opposed to just the daytime sleepiness, so he referred me to a Pulmonologist who speacialized in Sleep Medicine. I did an overnight sleep study and a sleep latency nap study the following day. The criterion for a diagnosis of Narcolepsy (at least it was in 2006) is a sleep latency (time it takes to fall asleep) of less than five minutes for five naps (20 minutes max length) that are spaced two hours apart, and you must enter REM sleep in at least two of the five naps. 
 
Here is a sampling of my sleep patterns according to my FitBit. I've definitely seen a lot worse on here. LOL That's why I'm posting this so that some of you might feel confident enough to tell your docs that you think there might be something more than just your average sleepiness. Now, I will say that part of the problem for Narcoleptics is not spending enough time in the most restorative stages of the sleep. Fitbit only records "restless" and "deep sleep" and of course it's not based on brain waves, so there's no way to know when you've been in REM sleep, etc. However, it gives you a pretty good idea of the amount of sleep you're getting.
 
I tried to include a wide sampling, showing some of my best and worst nights. Also, I  have it set to sensitive and dominant hand, but wear it on my non-dominant wrist to see if sensitivty was decreased. I've worn it on both wrists with the same settings and I don't think I noticed a huge difference.
 
Have fun analyzing!
@t.parker 13 hours 54 minutes?!?
For the last ~20 years (roughly my adult life) I've had problems waking up before 9AM.  My natural bedtime has been around 130 AM and I have to fight to keep it around 11 PM so I can make it to work in the morning.  Even then, I wake up tired and really drag in the morning.  Once in awhile I'll have an insomnia episode where, no matter how sleepy I am, I am unable to get to and stay asleep, even using over the counter sleep aids.  It builds over a week or so until it breaks and I can get some sleep. I'm always sleepy in the morning and have brain fog almost every day.  I've been medicating with caffeine so I can function in the mornings, and even then, I'm not functioning well.  I've been living alone until 2 years ago when I moved in with my now wife.  She pointed out how poor my sleep is in ways I would never have noticed on my own. To improve my sleep I wear an eye mask, have put up darker drapes on the bedroom window and talked with my wife and step-son so that they disturb my sleep as little as possible.  I've also obtained a weighted blanket to see if that reduces my movement.  However, I'll still toss that around even though its 20 pounds.  I also take melatonin before bed and often magnesium too.  I set my phone to reduce white light after sunset.   None of this has been a cure.  Things are so @$$ backwards for me, some caffeine and watching tv in bed have actually helped. I track my fitbit sleep data in excel based upon a worksheet I found on here (google pspfrench).  I see that my total hours slept and my total restorative sleep (deep+rem) vary in a sine wave pattern over time, if analyzed using a moving average. Based on that, I thought I might have sleep apnea.  I used another app to track my breathing and it said I breathe ok during sleep.  I'm having a sleep test done in a few weeks.  I'm also in the process of having my mental health checked.  There are several possibilities based upon my medical history, ranging from an atypical case of ADHD to Lupus.  I hope to have answers to that in a few weeks too.
Thank you. Marci. Have tried this and it seems to work. Wish I could get it to include my regular afternoon nap in my sleep time as well. I have had serious sleep problems for about 20 years. Nothing seems to work. Problems with prostate but made worse since heart-attack in 2011. My resting heart-rate is 58 bpm (with medication). Trying to use app to improve matters. Every blessing, AlanBTW I live in Scotland where "old" is "auld".
I knew I had trouble sleeping .. But didn't know how few hours I was really sleeping until I started wearing my tracker. I take ambien on occasion but try not to take it. I've used melatonin and Passion flower ... Both help some ... But I still only average about 3 hrs 20 mins a night of actual sleep . 🙃💤
Just an update, I just saw my sleep doctor again, and reported the insomnia wasn't improving. While he could pull up my logs from my CPAP machine, he also wanted to see my sleep logs. (Either ones I wrote manually or my Fitbit logs). I didn't have my FitBit logs with me, and he said if he could see them, it would help him diagnos what my problem was. So yeah, he (the sleep doctor specialist) took the logs very seriously.
Typically 9-20 times per night.  I think that is a lot.  Before I had my Fitbit, I thought I only woke up 2-3 times at most. Honestly though,I think it sometimes just calculates my tossing and turning as me beign awake. I notice that when I wear my fitbit on my non-dominant arm (left), it says I was awake more often and my sleep efficiency is usually around 30-60 percent, but when it is on my left arm, it says I was awake slightly less often and my sleep efficiency is usually around 90-100 percent.
My 30 day average is less than 30minutes deep sleep (6 per cent) which is way below average. Just don’t understand why I go from a very short deep sleep to instantly awake. The graph is pretty accurate in terms of when I wake at night and how I feel the next day. I fall sleep instantly but very poor sleep. I get 8 hours sleep
I am using normal not the sensitive setting. My sleep did track however it seems to be completely inaccurate. I had woken up, and rolled over, a minimum of 5 times in the night. I was thinking that my sleep tracker would look crazy the next morning but it didn't. It logged only restless for 2 minutes (2x), at very close times together. Has anyone else had this problem?
I ended up changing my Fitbit Charge to a Fitbit Charge HR  and I find with the heart monitor my sleep is better recorded.  Is it perfect, probably not, but I believe closer thanwhat the Charge was saying.I have sleep apnea and insomnia and restless leg so my pattern is all over the place.I find I am happier with the Charge HR.Tracy
Hm, thanks for the tip, but I could have sworn that is where I posted it.  Perhaps I just screwed up, but I'd tend to think that it got moved.
Check out the help topics in Flex 101 and look for the articles on sleep tracking. One in particular, "Why is my sleep graph different on my dashboard than my mobile app? Addresses part of what you're looking for. With the understanding (from the article) that there will be differences, I just check my 11 Mar 2014 graphs where I slept, got up and went back to bed. I stopped and restarted my fitbit flex during the time I was up.  First to set the scene:  I started sleep tracking at 23:50, stopped at 05:52.  Restarted at 06:09, stopped at 09:17. The dashboard tile (website, not mobile phone) shows just before 24:00 to just before 06:00 [@6 hrs] and says 3 hr. 19 min of sleep. When I click on the tile, the pop-up shows both time periods.  When I hover over the first, it says 3 hr 9 min and the second says 57 min. When I click on the arrow in the bottom right, it takes me to the sleep log which show the two graphs you show in your initial post.  They say 3 hr 9 min and 57 min the same as the popup.  On the right edge of the sleep log page are the 30 day sleep stats. Time Asleep for 11 Mar says 3.15 hrs (3 hours 9 min)  which is a match for the longest period. Total Time Asleep says 4.1 hours (4 hours 6 min) which is correct for the total. I don't have premium, so I can't speak for that. Do you really only get 30 minutes of sleep a night?
Anyone found a way to increase REM cycle? My REM numbers are below average, deep sleep numbers are fine. Cannot find good info on how to increase this stage of sleep?  Anyone had any luck with this?
The past few days my sleep chart has changed from a full display of REM and DEEP and LIGHT sleep throughout the night to just an abbreviated version showing much less detail. Can anyone suggest why or how to get back the original settings?Abbreviated ChartFull Chart
There are now Home Sleep Studies available. Talk to your doctor.
I can see there is a fluctuation range: high to low but what does that really mean?  To me I see a line the gos up and down lightly in the middle of range, but this does not really tell me much.  What would be useful would be to be able to click on any point on the variation line and get the time and the O2 saturation level. This would be a lot more beneficial than just the line itself.
 
Please update the app to be able to show the time (exact) and the O2 saturation at that time, when clicking on any point on the variation line. 
 
thanks
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Sounds like you're going to have to manually set your sleep time. You can do this on your pc in your fitbit page. Just click on the sleep page and manually enter the time you went to sleep and woke up.
Does the recorded sleep cycle continue uninterrupted?
Hi @iJackie, Check out this article on sleep, I think it will have some good information for you. For instance, it says:“It’s perfectly normal to have periods of restlessness—10 or even up to 30 could be normal for you.” (Here’s when restlessness might be more concerning.) So based on the number of restless moments, you would be normal. But since you've also reported being very tired, it may not be enough sleep for you.Take a look at the pinned Deep Sleep thread. Also, if you search "sleep hygiene" on this forum, you'll get lots of ideas also.By the way, which Fitbit model are you using?

1st one sr guys my eng is not good if i said something wrong abt grammar forgive me abt that . Like i said in the topic , we knew sleeping have 4 stage / wake up/ light / deep/ rem / but wake up at the first of cycle and the last one will make you feel really good and the otherwise wake up at the middle you gonna feel really bad for whole day and the question is how can we wake up at 1st cycle and the last of 4cycle . In google they have some recipe for caculator time to wake up but some people can not fall in sleep in 15 or 30 min someone like me need close to 1 hour for fall in sleep it's hard to caculator . But we have fitbit watch , imagine if FIbit update a alarm wake up for the cycle of stage it's gonna be really awesome to have a full energy and a great day.
so you are looking for data to support a theory that if you sleep deep enough, even fewer hours will result in healthy sleep.. instead of being in bed for longer with fitful sleep? I think that is achieved through some form of deep meditation. I think for most, it is 6 hours of good sleep to feel productive the next day.

Sleep errors again out of the blue. Sleep stages were advertised as a feature for months before they were actually available. Refuses to log my exercise days properly. Fitbit said months ago they know about this problem and they're 'working on it.'In the meantime they release a bunch of new products they expect me to buy. Fitbit as a company is starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth.

Hi!  Does anyone know what it means if your percentage of REM sleep is consistently higher than the benchmark normal range for your age?  Everything else is in the normal range except for "awake".  That is usually below the benchmark normal range.
Adding to @MatthewFitbit the first single sleep bar will be the greater of any other sleeps for the day.

@shwaldman You're right about closing eyes while driving not being good! I will have to check out the mindful yoga and give it a try. Glad it is helping you to have an efficient sleep! Thanks!
Hello @coolwater  The 02 reading throughout the night are not available. I am not sure where you saw this was and who refered to it but I think there is a misunderstanding or a mistake, as those data are not available.
Hello Benny; Yes, 5.3 hrs sleep is all my body needs. This is pure sleep. When I hit the pillow, I'm asleep in a few minutes. So don't get a headache thinking about how little I sleep. Try for yourself regulating your wake-up time first and your going to sleep time. As your body gets use to this consistency, you can start to slowly push back your bedtime later and later.
Nope 😞 Perhaps it is going to make me wait until tomorrow. I'll try again in the morning. Thanks for the input!!
Anyone know?
That's confusing. According to fitbit: Q: Have any previously existing Fitbit features moved behind a Premium paywall?A: No. All the Fitbit app features you enjoyed before Premium are still available for free, and we’ll continue to add new free features in the future. Fitbit Premium adds new paid features, but does not remove any previously free features. taken from: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Fitbit-Premium-Coach/Fitbit-Premium-Guide/m-p/3744853#M3556 that post also says: "All Fitbit users will continue to have access to their time asleep, sleep schedule, sleep quality details, as well as weekly hours slept compared to their sleep schedule. Additionally, all Fitbit users with a device capable of heart-rate tracking will also see their sleep stages and sleep score. Premium members will see all of the above, and also receive a deeper analysis of how their sleep score is calculated. This deeper analysis includes visibility into sub-scores for time asleep, deep and REM sleep stages, and restoration details, which provides analysis of your sleeping heart rate and time spent tossing and turning." So, according to that, you should still have access to your sleep score. If you don't then something is wrong and perhaps you ought to contact customer support. Could it be that you have your score but not the "deeper analysis"?
It has made me realize how badly I sleep and the need for improvement.
I have come up with the answer as to why they don't leave alone somethingthat works. To keep their jobs, they have to come up with something,hopefully better. Then they have to wait for us to get used to the changes.It seems to happen with all computer aspects. I dread the days when I logoff my computer, when it takes a while to shut down to downloading newfeatures. Then we have to go thru a learning curve AGAIN. For instance, doyou remember when you could highlight a section of an email and print outjust what you need, not the whole thing. That feature seems to be gone forgood.
On a couple occasions my Fitbit 2 has logged a low HR for a short period of time while sleeping. I'm not sure if the Fitbit lost 'signal' for a few moments and the HR is an average of what was collected including non-read zero BPM's. I do normally have a low resting HR (bradycardia) and possible apnea, so I'm wondering if a low read could be legit. Doctor's appointment in a couple weeks and I'm going to present this to him, but looking for some opinions prior.
All the HR-enabled Fitbits will do this kind of sleep tracking. Personally, I recommend the Charge 2 a lot, or the Ionic if you want GPS and route maps. Both will track your resting heart rate also.

OK, thanks. Is it the iOS app or the Windows app? If you're using the web dashboard and a browser, the benchmarks don't appear. Only in the app.

My night was recorded in 2 periods : from 11PM to 2AM then from 3.5AM to 7AM with a score for each period... how can I make it appear in only one period with one score ?
You are probably getting the full 7.  When the setting is sensitive it is tracking every little thing your body does.  Even if you rollover you might be completely asleep but the tracker will say you are restless.  The only true way to know if you have sleep apnea is to do a sleep study.  I suggest you talk to your doctor and see what they say.  Just remember the fitbit is a tool, not a true medical device.

Thanks very much.  I found where to create a custom activityand made one called Surge Sleep.  I will try to activate it tonight.  Great idea.
I'm fairly confident saying that your breath and heart aren't stopping for ten minute periods. This happens to me on occasion, for about ten minute periods also. What I've gathered is that sometime during the night I'm tossing or turning in a way that causes the tracker sensor to temporarily lose signal contact with my wrist, and that's causing the drop-out. In general, if I feel rested and there's not huge area of "restless" in the sleep data, things are fine. Good choice going to see a doctor, as they will be able to tell you definitively about it.

Hi! I'm having that exact same issue. I got my FITBIT CHARGE 3 beginning of Dec, by the 3rd week of January, it changed to the vertical lines, like you stated. I'm thinking, maybe that was a complimentary feature. So I have upgraded to FITBIT Premium and am having the same issue.
opps my mistake should have read the posts here first haha Found out how to edit the sleeps.but couldnt see how to delete my post, so just letting you know all is good!

@GoodGuy5000HD wrote:I can understand why the FDA was hesitant to approve the Estimated oxygen variation (EOV) graph: with little guidance about what constitutes a "problem,"Why would the FDA be hesitant to allow a graph of O2 saturation versus time when they have no issue with the Pulse Rate versus time? If the FDA doesn't allow O2 data to be recorded and graphed, why would the FDA permit the 02 data to be displayed on the clock face?  Puzzle. For sometime now I've been trying to get someone at Fitbit to explain what the Y-axis (on the left hand side) of the EOV graph represents. The latest explanation is that the Y-axis is actually 02 readings with the bottom of the scale at 92% O2 and the top of the scale at 98% 02 and the dividing line between "high" and "low" at 95%. (In red, I've inserted the suggestion made by the Fitbit rep).But that explanation doesn't make sense when combined with the statement directly below that says: I had originally expected that the Y-axis label to be CHANGE in O2 with a scale of (say) 0 to 10%, that would make some degree of sense. But then what do you do with negative changes (for example the observed 02 changes from 95% to 92%..... that would be a  -3% change). I wish that I could get someone at Fitbit (or in the community @ this forum) to clarify what the scale on this graphic is supposed to represent. This question has been asked over and over again over the past 3 years without an adequate response.   Even my doctor can't interpret this graph, so does it provide some value.
I put my One on the sensitive setting, and sleep with it attached to my underwear.  I feel it is most accurate there, and yes, it can tell the difference between sleeping and laying very quietly. I first tried using the wristband, and it seemed like the results were not accurate at all, even on my non-dominant hand on the "normal" setting. Sorry, I missed the fact you were asking about the Flex.
@kneppster, thanks for updating the App! @paperwife, @Westnet, welcome to the community forums! 
 
@paperwife looks like your Sleep stages weren't tracked. Instead, you see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) Note that in order for you to receive a Sleep score, Sleep Stages must be received. This also applies for you @Westnet. 
 
There are some scenarios that prevent Sleep Stages to be recorded, please consider the following: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
See you around.

I to have been to the sleep ap clinic a ouple of times overthe last 10 years and they say origionally said that I have mild sleep apnea then the second time they said I was ok.My family got me the fitbit for my 52nd birthday and I have just started using it.My wife complains that she gets poor slep becouse of me olso.My stats for last night are below which it has broken into 4 sections. I couls only just fit them onto the screen capture.I don't know if this helps you or not but they do seem to be very similar to yours.I also work 8 to 9 hrs per day and drive for 2 hrs per day on top of that.
Hi there,  I am a fairly new FitBit user, and am still getting the hang of things.  I have what may be a silly question.  I looked through the discussions and couldn't find anything relevant.  If there is a thread going, I apologize in advance.   During the day I wear my Charge HR on my non dominant (left) wrist.  I usually wear it on the same wrist at bedtime, but I noticed my sleep pattern hasn't been great, and I decided to try wearing it on the opposite wrist to see if there was a difference.   Usually I am restless up to 35 times a night.  When I wear it on my other wrist, I am only restless less than 10 times a night.   Bottom line is, does it matter which wrist it is worn on during sleep?? Thanks in advance! Sheri

Hi @Twignest, welcome back. Are you still experiencing higher than benchmark REM sleep?  

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
I rarely get more than 30 min for each nightly. I get 7.5+ hrs per night of sleep.  Is this typical??
From personal experience, I just took the info my wife gave me to the doctor and he had me try out a medication to help with RLS.  That did the trick and I was able to avoid a sleep study.
I saw a few weeks ago that Fitbit was still rolling out the sleep stages feature to those with Charge 2s and other applicable Fitbits, but I still haven't gotten mine! Anyone else still waiting, and have you heard anything from Fitbit about how long they expect this rollout will take?
Hello @Katsuzosb  I moved your post to the Sleep well section.Well this is complex. I also look closely at this metric because I can feel that if my sleeping heart rate is under my resting heart rate, I am more refreshed. Various factors seems to affect this, for me most of my night I have around 90% below my resting heart rate. For the night where it is less than 90%, sometimes as low as 30% either I was very stressed, or had a somewhat tiresome day but not in a good way, or I am sick.I also have an autoimmune disease (auto inflammatory) and when it acts up my sleeping heart rate is higher than usual. So I would say that in your case, it might be a contributing factor, maybe even the main. And is a sign your disease is making you fatigued. So not great news. Is there way to make your disease less active ?
Hello everyone. 
 
Thanks for sharing your inputs and experiences. I believe that a normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, but the rate can vary based on age and fitness level. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness. For example, a well-trained athlete might have a normal resting heart rate closer to 40 beats per minute.
 
But I believe if you have inquiries about your Resting Heart Rate, my best recommendation is to consult with an expert. 
 
See you around.

Peppermint smells really nice and is calming. I can sleep sound without any interruptions.  I put a few drops of lavender on a piece of cloth underneath my pillow too.
I am currently in a fitbit step challenge with a number of friends which is great, BUT..... I am really focused on increasing the amount of sleep I get (really the weekly average overall) as well as the most restful sleep.  Can fitbit create a Sleep Challenge that we can participate in? Thanks! Anne-Margaret
I'll give that a shot tonight, and let you know how it goes, thanks.  With my sleep, I'll often be awake enough to know I'm awake, but dreaming at the same time.  That seems to be happening at the same time I'm seeing 1 minutes worth of "awake" at the same time as it's showing "REM".  I'm wondering if this might be narcolepsy, with the hypnogogic/ hypnopompic hallucinations, but I recently had a level 1 sleep study done, and that didn't show up.
@Odyssey13 wrote:@wannabfitSince you know you have sleep apnea, you must have a health care professional. Ask their advice on what would best work for you in light of your diagnosis. My sleep log often shows a low percentage but it depends on how restless I am or how often I get up to do something. It varies with each individual. Give it some time in tracking your sleep. You may want to take notes, too. It might help to keep a journal so you know when a stressful day leads to poor sleep or a great day leads to better sleep. Welcome to the forums.  @wannabfit I have to agree with @Odyssey13 your doctor will know the best way to proceed. My Sleep Apnea is improved with a inclined wedge used to keep my head higher as I am not able to wear the CPAP. The sleep tracker is most helpful if you note when you are restless and or awake and relate it to a pattern within a time period of one to four weeks. Then you can use the stats to help your doctor help you as well. I found that I was eating certain foods that effected my sleep and that my restlessness was most always during the same time period... the great thing about the Fitbit Flex is that I have found the why to  many scenarios thanks to the tracking. Good luck to you!

Not everyone is the same and I am not sure in which ways the tracker can be off. If you feel rested, I would not worry about it. If you are looking to see if you can change it then it would be best to look at how active you are throughout the day as well as your wind down ritual before bed. Meditation before sleep can have an impact on deep sleep and REM for example.

It's been 12 days w/o the sleep tracker working. Unsure why. Anyone have insight? When I asked support last week they just told me to reset it but that didn't fix it.
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Ive just started but some nights ive got up to 1/6th of my time as "restless" yet a reasonable sleey efficiency score.  And what is w waking up 20 times a night?  Is that normal?
My tips to a peaceful sleep are:Comfy pillow, not the hard ones. With a breathable fabric as a pillow cover. Soft lights, even my alarm clock is far away so I have to get up to turn it off.Warm shower before sleepingPhone in silent. Sleep well!

Hi Fitbitters,I am a new user of my fancy tech; I go nowhere without it and love it!The main reason I bought the fitibit was to track sleep, and am having a heck of a time getting used to the data logging. The default sleep sensitivitity settinging is "normal", with an option for "sensitive".Under normal, my log lookd reasonably normal:11:46PM 6:15AM 17min 7 4hrs 20min 71%  11:23PM6:01AM14min75hrs 56min93%  10:42PM6:23AM9min136hrs 50min91% On sensitive however, the numbers go way out of whack:  1:50AM6:36AM7min42hrs 32min59% 1:24AM6:46AM30min52hrs 32min60% 9:30PM5:30AM25min73hrs 51min53%2.5 hours, 2.5 hours again, then almost 4 hours? I know I'm tired a lot but these numbers seem highly inconsistent with the data obtained during normal mode.I'm wondering if "awake" is not necessarily "awake" but should be logged as "restless".Any thoughts?
yep, i used to wear my charge to bed, and it was easier. the versa is just plain-uncomfortable in bed.
It will automatically track sleep at any time, if the sleep is at least an hour long.  Shorter naps wont get recorded.  And to get sleep stages and sleep score, 3 hours of sleep is required.  But those have nothing to do with whether the sleep is during day or at night.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Thank you.  I will give it a try..dark room.
My sleep app has disappeared and can’t find it.
It worked!! If your Fitbit Inspire suddenly isn't logging your sleep check that it's set to "on wrist" 'cos that was the only thing I changed yesterday and it's logged my sleep again overnight!  Yaaaaaay! Back up to a 4 star review now, thankfully!  Don't like giving negative reviews for things!

Why can the fitbit register your sleep pattern which is based on your pulse rate i am assuming BUT it won't give you a pulse or a bp?  I would much rather know my pulse and bp then whether or not i am sleeping well?  We have 3 kids i know i don't sleep it comes with the territory.  anyone who can answer me, i would be greatful.  I know they have bands that do that but i don't want to have to wear two seperate bands to get all the info i want i would much rather have just one for everything.
Sleep hygeine is definitely something people need to be educated on. I am able to fall asleep reptty quickly to educational podcasts. For some reason, they keep my mind active enought thbat I can lull to sleep. I have found TED Talks are the perfect duration to play then shut off within a few minutes.

It currently says no more users can join the beta.
Agree!  We should have the ability to choose to display either one, or both, in the app settings!
I work 6pm to 6am. My normal sleep hours are from  9am to3pm.
The restart didn't help. I'm still getting basic details only, without the more detailed display and analysis that used to appear. I've now changed the sleep setting from Normal to Sensitive to see if that makes any difference. It's a setting I haven't changed before. In fact, I didn't know the setting existed. I'll report back again tomorrow.
Hey,i got a charge 3 and i like it very much so far. Only issue: Even though i track my sleeping and my heart rate is also tracked, i do not get any sleep score or info about REM phases and such. Only the times where i was restless or awake, but the rest is categorized as "no stage". My wifes tracking worked the first night, but the second it didn't.What is the issue here? I already tried restarting my fitbit.
I find that peppermint tea really helps me to doze off. It's caffeine free and quite pleasant. I also have the bad habit of using my phone or laptop as I'm in bed.
Well it is what your body is a customed to. Usually people workout in the morning because give them a lot of energy. However, if thats only time you can do it, I don't see why not.
When you sync it you could look to see if there was a change in patterns - heartbeat a lot slower one night than another, or really restless sleep, but it's not medical equipment. Think someone here reported they recharged their fitbit one night yet saw 'sleep activity' when they synced it. You can use it as a pointer, but don't rely on it for medical decisions.

Hi,for the first time I have a simplified view of sleep.did you ever get a reply to this?Did it get corrected?is something that I did to my fitbit?
There's a button for that
It did work yes. I have to say though that since then the sleep recording isn’t very accurate so I’ve lost interest in the function anyway.
I have just started with FitBit and am amazed to see that my sleep effectiveness is only 65%.  What is a healthy sleep effectiveness percentage. --- Thanks.
I've had mine for a couple of weeks..what has happened to you has happened to me a few times..usually when some sort of vibration is going on..I am a teacher and whenever I use the manual pencil sharpener it definitely happens..It has happened on other occasions but very rarely and I usually can catch it really quickly.
I'm retired and l do get up the same time as you .Get up and start your day and you'll feel better .Exercise , check your e-mail, have coffee , go for a walk ,eat ,go to work . Your best time of the day is in the morning ,especially in the summer . You got all the space by yourself with nobody around . Eventually you,ll get tired and go to bed early and have a good long night sleep Sweet dream
Hi..I had the same thoughts when I saw the changes. Then I realized that if you scroll down from the big graph, you will find most of the info you are used to seeing.  However, sleep % seems to be no longer available and I miss that.  Another thing I MISS  is on the graph that shows the nite info, there is no way to find out what time(s) the awake/restless times occur. Gail Thompson gailtdx@gmail.com
I’m having the same issue, every weekday at 10pm! It must be a new update or something and it’s making me crazy. I double check my settings day after day and nothing is turned on. I’m about to throw this thing in the trash…
I have an occasional spiked reading during the night. Latest was 146. Also trying to establish if this is a fault or a potential health issue. fitbit don’t seem to be addressing it.
Hi, I am quite appalled by my waking up pattern , now for last night apparently i have woken up 8 times as per my alta tracker. Is that ok ? or Normal.  Louis
I suffer with a racing mind, either not being able to fall asleep at bedtime or waking up after a few hours and having trouble falling back asleep. I struggle to reach my goal of 7 hours of sleep each night. I am usually at 5 or 6 hours.  Insomnia and a racing mind is something that I have had since I was a child. I have read some of the other posts, and saw some great recommendations that I will try. However many of them include the use of electronic devices (i.e. listening to podcasts, YouTube, etc.) Some suggested reading and I am curious if it means reading an actual physical book or an electronic device such as a kindle? I find watching Netflix relaxing, especially documentaries, but is that hindering my sleep? Many sleep scientists have said that it is a good idea to stay away from electronics at bed time, keep them out of the bedroom all together.  I have tried this a few times, although sometimes I get anxious when I do not have my cell phone nearby, and it seems that if used properly, can be a tool to help relax me, based on suggestions in this thread: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Better/Racing-mind-at-night/m-p/1769930 So my question is, do you feel that electronic devices can help or hinder sleep?
This is something many of us wonder. read this thread

Melatonin might help also, but if you've never taken it before make sure you're off the next day as it wires some people out.
Yes, this morning my sleep chart was . . . different, I'd say dumber, like it didn't receive all the usual data. The chart in fitbit.com dashboard was titled "Sleep Pattern" instead of the usual "Sleep". Could something be wrong with my Blaze? Update: Last night's sleep chart was fine. The cause for dropping to "Sleep Pattern" appears to be if I edit that sleep session (change the wake up time, in this case). Perhaps the software has difficult parsing the data if the duration is arbitrarily changed. But I've changed sessions before; maybe it has something to do with when I do the edit (Sleep Pattern appeared when I immediately edited upon waking).
I know, it's been more difficult to fall asleep for me, since I'm constantly checking all social media and reading bad news 😥, but I'll make sure to start practicing better habits before going to bed.

It seems that many of us here have sleep graphs similar to that. There is something other than sleep apnea called upper airway resistance syndrome. Basically, what this means is that there's an increased respiratory effort to breathe, and you wake up briefly. But unlike sleep apnea, you wake up before you get to the point of not breathing. The increased effort could be nasal obstruction or anatomy issues.
Sleep score of 88.  I feel like I slept good or as good as possible for me.

Reasons why I can’t sleep are stress, anxiety and really turning my brain off - too much to do.  I have a high stress/high demand job - sometimes working from 7am to 2am (on a bad day) and the only thing that works for me is CBD with a lavender scented eye mask.  if I can get some exercise that day, that’s helpful too.
What sensitivity setting do you have it on? Or rather, what hand is your dominant hand, what arm do you wear it to sleep, and does your Fitbit settings reflect those?
I was having a lot of extra heart beats and getting Palpitations in my chest and turns out I have PVC pre ventricular contractions.  After testing it was revealed I have a slightly enlarged heart and doctor sent me to sleep clinic where I was told I have sleep apnea and need CPAP even though I don't snore. Of course he never showed or sent me the data. I'm just supposed to accept whatever the deity says but my graph from fitbit does seem to confirm there's a lot of variation in blood oxygen. Anyon3 else care to paste their pics to compare. Mine has lots of spikes.
all of that is usually corrected by synching your Fitbit with the app. If you are having trouble synching you can watch this video for helpful tips.

Hello everyone!! I've been using my fitibt charge hr for about 2 weeks and i've been very happy with it. The only question/complaint is about sleep tracking usefulness. So far the app only tracks sleeping effectivness as a percentage and that's it. I thought initially that the fitbit would record or extrapolate more information (like sleep cycles, or active minutes vs sleep minutes, etc...) I don't find that useful the sleep efectiveness byt itself if no other information is shown. Any ideas if more updates will bring more info? Thanks
I've been doing this for years.  I have a circadian rhythm disorder called Non-24 Sleep-Wake Syndrome which means that unless I manipulate my light and dark signals, I am on a 25 hour day, falling asleep an hour later every day.  I initially treated this using a bright lightbox in the morning, which got me on a 24 hour pattern but still falling asleep far too late (Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome).  Then I found darkness therapy, which means cutting out blue light for a few hours before bed and during the night.  You don't have to use honking big safety goggles, and there are lots of orange tinted glasses around with reviews for this purpose.  You do need to make sure they block 100% of blue light, which is a fairly strong tint.  I tried it out briefly with orange light bulbs (still useful, as some light gets in around the edges) and screen filters (f.lux on the "ember" setting will do), and the results were so dramatic that I went out and got an orange-tinted pair of prescription specs made up.  A good optician should be able to sort out the right tint, if you need prescription glasses.  There's a fair amount of research about darkness therapy for sleep by now, and also on how nighttime light exposure affects other things such as hormones.  The breast cancer rate triples in night shift workers, for instance.
I was diagnosed with narcolepsy back in 2015 and just last week I saw a sale for the FitBit Flex. I decided to get it while it was cheep just to see what this thing said my sleep looked like... it's depressing. I will open my sleep chart to all but I get 3.5hr a night on average for a 8 hour nights sleep. I went to the doctor to get tested for a sleep disorder when I almost fell asleep driving with my kid in the car. (Luckily I noticed and pulled over to switch drivers with my wife.) Low and behold it was full blown narcolepsy. If you feel like you never sleep but are always sleeping... GET TESTED. Since I was put on Nuvigil my life has returned to semi-normal... still tired, but at least I can do things and not have to be scared I will pass out.
I have narcolepsy (mostly symptom free starting in my 30’s) and I’m ok with close to an hour of deep sleep but feel horrible on night with 20 minutes. Using earplugs helps me a lot. I can’t really tell what causes less deep sleep. It sure messes me up though.
I am new to fitbit and have the Alta HR I am mainly interested in the sleep tracker but the only display I get is the one with shows when your restless etc and for how long.There is another screen which shows when you are in a deep or light sleep which I can't find. I woke one morning and the display showed this screen but not been able to see it again.Can anyone help please. Thank youMichelle
Hello: I have a problem with my Fitbit Versa 3. It is not accurately reporting the amount of REM sleep I get. I have a condition called sleep paralysis. Because of this, I went for a medical sleep study. It showed that I was in REM sleep for 25% of the night. My Fitbit app has never said that I get anywhere near that. It typically shows somewhere between 5-7% of my sleep in REM. I know for a fact this is inaccurate, especially since when I do have sleep paralysis, it should show me as in REM and then waking. It often shows me as in Light Sleep and then waking, which isn't possible, since sleep paralysis only occurs during REM sleep. I am a a male, 172 cm tall, and weigh 71 kg. My resting heart rate usually falls at 55bpm, which I think is oddly low. I have speculated as to whether my heart rate doesn't elevate as much as most peoples does during REM sleep, and if this is why the Fitbit is not tracking it. In short: I know that I spend a lot more time in  REM sleep than my Fitbit tracker reports, but, I don't know whether it's a flaw with the product or something to do with my heart rate, but any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.
How can I get access to sleep score beta? Will more spots open up? I really want to try this out. Thank you 🙂

Ok, there are a million comments and “thumbs up” in the forums on this.We want to see the day the sleep is assigned to as “the day I went to sleep”. If I go to bed Sunday night at 11pm and wake on Monday at 7, this is being shown as my sleep on Monday. This is not how anyone in the real world thinks, that I’ve ever seen. When I look at my records, and I want to see how much sleep I got last Wednesday, I shouldn’t have to look at Thursday. It is counter-intuitive.And if I go to bed after midnight, which I often do, I still deem this as the sleep from the day I woke up (so if I go to bed “Sunday night” at 12:30pm -yes I know “technically” it’s Monday”- and wake 6 hours later at 6:30am on Monday, I want this recorded as my SUNDAY night’s sleep).We all know that’s the way it should be, so please don’t close this suggestion to comments. Hear us.
Hi thereI have a sleepingdisorder. 90% efficiency is not okay. But you should not go over 1 night, but a longer period. How about your heartrate? Does it slow down like it should? I am very curious for the answers to your other questions.
And to add to that, I’d like to compare my benchmark against people with and without kids. Let us choose 🙂
Hi @justinfit2020 and welcome to the forums. I also use the sleep reports to measure the effectiveness of various methods of sleep preparation. The simplest approach is to watch your sleep scores and how/if they are changing. But you can also try this: From the Fitbit app on your phone, tap Sleep -> Deep and REMTap 30 Day AverageThat should give your a good idea of how your sleep stages are reacting to the melatonin. If you cannot find this chart, please let me know which Fitbit device you have and which phone you sync to.
I expect that solid blue is not deep sleep.  It takes at least 3 hours of sleep for Fitbit to detect sleep stages and give a sleep score.When you get a sleep pattern with above key: deep blue - asleep; light blue - restless; red - awake,that deep blue  is not the same thing the sleep stage "deep"; it just means you were asleep with no sleep stage information available.  Actually, with less than 3 hours, it might just mean you were not moving around.

It's very annoying to me that the only "Tip"  Fitbit can give me to get better / more Deep and REM sleep is to  "limit alcohol 3 hrs before bedtime since it can suppress REM sleep." This a totally useless "tip" for me because I don't drink alcoholic beverages.    Fitbit people -- please update this section!
my sleep last night. might be apnea?
You are right @Colinm39, it is a habit and a general idea we all have when starting the day. Thank you for replying!

I'm having the same issue, only thing is I'm having 2 different sleep logs on 2 different dashboards. The newer dashboard is always right the older version always wrong.
I had a similar situation with my Charge 3 @sikorski, I used to get a bit anxious when wearing my Fitbit to bed, but after a while I finally got used to it and know I don't even think about it, but I do prefer to recharge the device at night sometimes. 
 
I also had the Fitbit One a long time ago, and it used a large strap that you would wrap around your arm to track sleep, so the Charge 3 and the new watches now feel a lot smoother. 😄

For Kesaiserris:  Have you ever been tested for narcolepsy? Some of the information here and in your other comments sound like textbook narcolepsy.
Hi,I have a charge 4 and I wear it all the time, throughout the day and when I sleep. Yesterday my device was charging during the night, so normally no sleep data from last night. When I got up and looked on the app at the data my fitbit had collected, it had set up a sleep pattern during the night, where I woke up, rem, had light and deep sleep. It was a detailed graph, not a simple graph like you get when your fitbit can't measure a consistent heart rate. I found this very strange, which is why I'm asking if other people are having this problem and how it is possible that the fitbit has been collecting data. I am also not connected to multiple devices, this charge 4 is my first fitbit device. Thanks in advance for the response.
@CAO59 wrote:I usually sleep between 6-7 hours and the sleep score is saying 3-4.AFAIK, sleep score didn’t change the way Fitbit determines time asleep. Time asleep is counted as total time spent in bed, minus time spent awake. You may disagree with the way Fitbit detects your bedtime, your wake up time and the time you’re awake in-between these, but it has nothing to do with sleep score.

Can someone tell me why my fitbit doesn't show the start of my sleep.  I may go to bed at 10 pm, but my fitbit dashboard shows after midnight
I love my Fitbit, but, I too, have been experiencing bouts of insomnia while wearing it at night.  i think what happens is that if it takes too long for me to fall asleep or if I wake a few hours after falling asleep, I become anxious about what the Fitbit stats will say in the morning.  So I have decided that unless I truly need to wake up at a specific time, I will remove the Fitbit at night and alleviate the stress of those "dang" statistics.  I like the gentle wake-up of the vibrating watch but will go without for a few nights and see if my overall sleep improves.
Hello @CAM345  I'm not sure I understand clearly, but if I do, I think this is something you're probably better off calling an electrician, or a heater maintenance person for instead of asking fitbit? Regards,Bart
If the recommended amount of sleep is 8 hours and typically most people are awake for up to 20% and the Fitbit records time sleeping then should I be shortening my target sleep amount to about six and a half hours to seven hours?  I seem to be constantly failing but I am spending 8 hours in bed.
how do I turn off smart awake
I’m checking my sleeping heart rate and trying to compare it to a “normal” one to see if  I’m on track. I’ve found 3 different shapes of charts here but mine doesn’t look like any of them. It’s more.... level? My SHR seems to just be up/down constantly. I’m wondering if that could explain being tired all the time?
How low is your budget? The question appears because as much as I know, a good mattress is pretty expensive. I bought a new mattress last year, and I chose the memory foam. It looked at the best reviews on sleepauthorities.com. and as much as I know this website has real reviews. My opinion is, you should invest in a good mattress, because it will serve you for many years and it's good for your back. At least, don't go with the cheapest option, I'm sure you'll regret afterwards.
I would imagine that a tracker with an HR function will give more accurate results since it takes into consideration the slowing down of your heart beat when you enter the various stages of sleep.

I've been thinking about this feature for a long time and glad to see someone else had thought about it too, even though it was 3 years ago.  I'm surprised this "challenge" has not been added to the list.  I host step-based challenges with my friends almost every week but the problem is that steps can be faked easily, to the point where I've stopped inviting certain people because their steps wouldn't hold true in an audit.  Sleep, however, cannot be easily faked and I don't understand why anyone would even want to fake it... unless they had a financial incentive? Anyway, I think a sleep challenge is way overdue and is a great way to encourage people to get enough sleep.  We live in a society that puts sleep at the lowest priority and I think this feature is something the world needs.
@pg3t   In answer to your first question, Fitbit doesn't have any current way to monitor either central or obstructive sleep apnea.  In answer to your second question, I am not an expert on sleep disorders.  My internet search tells me that RBD is a sleep disorder where people move during dreaming. Fitbit's Help article on sleep stages makes it sound like the sleep stage algorithm depends on the "not moving" part of REM sleep to put you in REM stage sleep.  Everything I read suggests that a Fitbit will underestimate your REM sleep. I think you should talk with you doctor if you have other concerns.

First, congrats on your weight loss, and especially on keeping it off! Disclaimer:  I am not a doctor or any kind of health professional so don't put too faith in my opinion,and I expect there are others who will say, if in any doubt, see a doctor,but my opinion:I wouldn't worry about it unless you have any symptoms from it.  Lower heart rate is good.  I would try looking at other days you don't work out and see if you normally get a lower HR the night after them. Also, depending on your PCP situation and perhaps location, many places you can leave a message for doctor, or call up and talk to nurse and ask about it.  Also some health insurance companies have a number you can call to talk to a nurse.  I suspect they would say it's nothing to be concerned about but I can understand would at least make you feel less anxious about it.

I noticed today that my sleep pattern is identical every night for the last week or more. Is anyone else having this problem? I have not gone to bed at the same time each night, Sunday night I wasn't even wearing it, but all nights are the same. Do you have any suggestions??  Thanks in advance.
Sad, when your sleep goal is 6 hours and you met it for the first time last night after 5 years.
Hi Sarah, very interesting story. I am 78 still do gym, and racket sports. My wife and I both uses our Fitbit to check and compare our sleep pattern. She sleeps well no doubt. I tend to go after Midnight. I try my hardest to go before 11. I find when i go before 11 my training goes much better and i am stronger in everyway. I try to get 6 hours which i feel is sufficient for me. All the best to all. Byron
Coincidentally -- another change to the dashboard was to switch the weight tile from a progress indicator, to a big fat demotivating number.  I removed that one as soon as it showed up. I'm just getting back into exercising after being off the wagon for a couple years due to health and family issues.  These updates aren't helping.  I've actually now benched my FitBit because of these unhelpful (harmful) scores and readouts -- kind of enjoying the freedom from the minutia and looking forward to focusing on the big rocks. We still have our old Wii, I'll be using that for fitness tracking going forward - don't have to worry about being blindsided by app "enhancements" there.
I do hope this is sorted out quickly. My last three nights sleep have all been recorded in the classic sleep mode. Granted I have been finally meeting my sleep goals of 7+ hours but its not really comparable to the sleep stages I am use to tracking my sleep with.
What I'm trying to do is get more quality of sleep, and if I can get my sleep patterns in a CSV or summarized over a time period (say a week) that would be helpful. I know the fitbit webpage already lists how much I sleep, but I'd also like to see percentage in each stage of sleep. That will allow me to compare whether I sleep better on mattress A vs B, if eating before bed (and what I eat) vs. going to bed hungry, thirsty vs. hydrated etc.  It would also be helpful if there was a field for each night to enter notes.
Hi I'm Larry and sence I starte working out 4 or 5 hours is all I get are bodys are healing your brain is getting tiered but not your body.. Just be thankfull were not dead. I Love this stuff
I rebooted my Charge 4 on Wed morning.  I got a full reading for Wednesday night.  YAY. But then last night it went back to only reporting 3+ hours and I now I slept fairly soundly all night.  I do have my sleep sensitivity setting set to Normal and not sensitive.  That was a suggestion in one of the earlier posts about this problem.  Mine has always been set on normal. Sigh. I also see I have an update but it doesn't seem to want to download. The fit bit is charged, Bluetooth is set up properly, the Internet is available.  All the things they say need to be ready for the update to occur, yet it comes back and tells me it can't do it-unable to locate Fitbit....which it had just barely synched.
Newbie here. I was looking for this exact issue with my Versa2. Does any moderator ever respond to these posts or do I just go ahead and heckle them in person?
Having an issue with my sleep graph showing WAY more hours slept than what my tracker says.  Not it sure of this is due to recent upgrades but would like to know how to fix this. Tracking sleep is important to me because I struggle getting enough and the graph telling me I slept 9-10 hours when I didn't is really weird See below. There is no way I slept 9 plus hours when I went to. bed at 12am and woke up around 5:30. Not sure why it is showing the wrong hours
This was last night. Pretty typical for me - the sleep efficiency, not the "to bed" time - with my Surge set to Sensitive. 62% is about the norm.I couldn't say how accurate the device is though, since I have nothing to complare it to, but I rarely feel as if I've had a good night sleep. Last night I even took a shot and a half of Nyquil (I'm coming down with a cold). Does it matter that I don't recall being awake fo all of that "red" area?

My Fitbit did not record sleep time last night
Hi Personally set to "Normal". To help deciding which setting to use, From the fitbit article: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device? What is the difference between the normal and sensitive sleep setting?Your device's setting can record your sleep in either "sensitive" mode for extremely detailed sleep reporting or "normal" mode for a more basic idea of your sleep patterns. Note that if you use a Fitbit device with heart-rate tracking to detect your sleep stages, this setting doesn't apply. The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.The sensitive setting will cause your device to record nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake. This setting may be helpful for users who wake up feeling tired even though their sleep history shows sufficient rest.Hope it helps
I had bad sleep swings since April, it got harder for me to sleep at night, and would only sleep at sunrise. I was very stressed and would wake up with panic attacks. I don't know tho if mood swings cause sleep swings or it's the opposite. But it's a vicious cycle.. Now it's getting better. I focused on going to bed early and disconnecting from anything work-related that would be stressful at least 2 hours before going to bed. This includes putting my phone on airplane mode.
Interesting! I didn't know you could do that! After looking at the normal version, I'm torn... I KNOW I had a rough sleep last night and tossed and turned, so an intermediate sensitivity is what I need I think. Sensitive is a tad bit too sensitive for me. or I could just be tired because I've had less sleep than i normally do. My usual is about 7.5 hours. I think I need to do some more testing.
Thanks but I don't sleep twice. It just repeats the same two graphs twice, down the right hand side of the sleep stats dashboard. I'm talking about the little blue vertical bar graphs.
That is certainly a bug!  I would call customer service if they have one...
I take one 5mg tablet of fast dissolve Melatonin each night about an hour before bed. It doesn't make me fall asleep but I seem to sleep more soundly.
You can delete one of the sleep periods, and edit the other one to include full time.  Then give a some time to recalculate.  But that will not prevent it from happening again.

Does anyone know what the 'typical range' refers to under sleep stage benchmarks?  I get that it is based off a meta analysis paper, and that the mid point seems to be the average for a my age and gender, but couldn't see in the paper or elsewhere how they derived the typical range. Is it 2 standard deviations? From the data in the paper, or from fitbit's collected data?Is it the range in which 90% of values fall?50%?Is is just an arbitrary number either side of the mean? This isn't explained anywhere and would be useful to decide at what point I should consider my sleep abnormal, and also just because I am a massive data nerd!
None of the fitbits can tell you which stages of sleep you are in at a set time. However, if you look at a simple sleep cycle chart you can deduce that the red spikes in your sleep pattern probably correlates with the REM stages of normal sleep, since this is the stage of sleep closest to an aware and awake state.When you are in deep sleep your body is still, so the blue areas include deep sleep, but not all blue is deep sleep - it simply means you did not move at the time.The red spikes means you have moved (or maybe your partner did?). The sensitive will in most cases show more red spikes...
Last night I did not do begin sleep now and I did not get the detailed graph still.
I bought a flex in September. When I first bought it I had to tap it to put it into sleep mode but a few months later I received an email telling me I could now have the flex automatically record sleep, but I don't remember what I had to do to install that onto the device. Well that fitbit died, I was sent a replacement but again I have to tap it to put it into sleep mode. Is there a way I can get it to do it automatically? Thanks.

My Fitbit Versa light wakes me during the night if I rollover a certain way. What can I do?I turnoff the screen wake and notifications before I go to sleep but it still lights up sometimes.
I'm curious why at times my FitBit One shows that I slept x number of hours when I never use my fitbit when I sleep.  When I got up this morning I looked at my dashboard and it showed that I had slept for 13hrs and 42mins.  In reality I slept around 5 hours.  And if my fitbit is around 25 feet from where I'm sleeping where is this information coming from?
Yea....but how do you know you slept better than previous days without the statistics from the fitbit to compare:) It is probably those little green flashing lights pumping energy into your metabolism!
Something else that is disruptive would be my Siberian Husky, who hates rain and storms.  Twice this week he's woken me up either too early or in the middle of the night because he's scared of the thunder.  Luckily I love him to pieces ♥

How do you record sleep with Fitbit ?

It will track anytime but needs at least 1 hour to detect nap, and 3 hours to get sleep stages. Not officially approved, but I have found if I'm going to take a shorter (less than an hour) nap, I can use the 'Begin Sleep Now' to get it logged as sleep. Also note sleep is always credited to the day you wake up.

Hi guys, I've use now Charge 2 and previously I've used for almost 1 year Charge(non HR) to measure my sleep pattern. Usually I go to bed around 23:15->23:30 and put the alarm at 8:00 AM in the morning. Problem is that I wakeup somehow tired and I don't know why. For normal sensitivity I get something like: 7h50-8h asleep and 14-16 times resteless and 2 times awakeFor sensitive tracking is much worse: 3h20-3h30 asleep 17-20 times restless, 4 times awake and 4h50 awake/restless Question is: how can I improve the quality of the sleep? should I let the tracker on Sensitive mode and try to wakeup on a different hour etc? Any advice is appreciated.

That's a good question, that answer about reading or whatever is off the mark. Other devices do it automatically. I forget to put mine in sleep mode every other night. Plus getting it into and out of the modes is not exactly easy.
I'm sorry none of us seem to have all the answers for you, but we all seem to have the same questions.  I've only had my Fitbit for less than a week and it's been very eye-opening (no pun intended).   I knew I was a restless sleeper - I have back and carpal tunnel problems that cause me to move alot.  But, I was really surprised to see how often I am restless.  My worst night was Friday with 22 occurances.  My best night was last night with only 9.  I had a very busy day Sunday and also took a few advil before I went to bed, so I'm sure that had alot to do with it.  I woke up very groggy, but knew that I'd had a good night's rest.
Fitbit will not auto-detect sleep of less than an hour.  You can still get credit for this on phone app:Sleep Tile > "+" at top right > Begin Sleep NowThen 'I'm Awake' when wake up, but will not get sleep stages or score with less than 3 hours sleep.

As you wrote in a post on another forum, your Charge 3 is your first Fitbit tracker, so your "HR history" is still likely limited (a few months at most). This makes it harder to know for sure what your "normal" RHR is. A fluctuation range of 15 bpm is not uncommon in my experience (based on about four years of wearing HR-enabled Fitbits). My RHR tends to be elevated with stress / disruptions from my regular routines (for instance, when travelling / away from home). If you have other symptoms or reasons to believe something could be wrong with your heart, you should consult with a medical professional, perhaps even a cardiologist, if you’ve never seen one before.

I can imagine it would be interesting to a new parent to see how much (or little) sleep they are getting month on month... though partners may now have evidence to say, hey I'm getting up twice as much as you! 🙂
It's not your sleep, it's definitely the fitbit. I had a Jawbone Up in the past, and it seemed VERY accurate. Other than sleep tracking, the UP didn't do other things nearly as well as the Fitbit Force. I'm thinking of going back to the UP just for sleep tracking because the Fitbit's data is so ridiculous. I can either choose between showing that I slept solidly even when I know I was up in the night; or showing that I hardly slept at all, even though I wake up totally refreshed after spending 8+ hours fin bed. I'm not sure who designed Fit bit's sleep algorithm, but they really need to start from scratch – it's horrible to the point of being worthless.
My phone app (Windows 10) shows that my resting heart rate today is 73, while the Fitbit Connect dashboard says it is 74. Not a huge difference but why are they not the same? Both are synced.
Hi @Rocketr, That's an interesting question. I saw an article here that lists sleep time by age. But I didn't see anything that broke it down to sleep stages. The percentages for Fitbit users are: I've read that with age, it becomes harder to get deep sleep especially.

but how does one explain many spikes into the high zone during the night?  How to talk to my doctor intelligently about the spikes?
@QBee430  You can input your current A1C numbers in the log area of your profile. You can also put in your daily blood glucose readings, too. As for sugar intake, you can log your food and get the daily breakdown of fats, carbs, fiber, sodium, etc. Welcome to the forums.

If you have an Android,  you must change your sleep sensitivity setting on fitbit.com. From the Web Dashboard by following the steps below: 
 
1. From the fitbit.com dashboard, click the gear icon An icon of a gray gear > Settings > your device image.2. Click Sleep Tracking and make your changes.
 
On a side note, make sure that the Fitbit App for your mobile device is up to date. 
 
Hope this helps.

I think if you sleep less than 6 hours regularly - its a bad sign for the future health.. Im sleeping average 8 hours. To fall asleep around 17-20 min, simply cuz im using my fav 'Insight Timer' app with mediation Breathing into Sleep, 17 min. Sleeeping like a baby. bcz we need to learn how to relax, think about nothing, let go... and just breath. It helps. About restless, some nights around 15-20 times for me, but that means im moving from side to side maybe, turning around, im not really 100% awake. Actually scientifically proved that if you turn around 15-20 times each night its ok! Norm. sorry if any gram mistakes peeps. Good luck with your sleep
@sammymack21, which model of Fitbit do you have?

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
That's insane! They should have it for all devices they sell. I don't want a wrist-band type tracker, I've had a Fitbit One for a few years now, beforethe wrist-band ones even had screens. I already have a running watch on one wrist and an ID on another, and some of the wrist-band ones are known to get easily loston long runs. Why penalize me for selecting the device that works best for me?
you can change the setting via the dashboard on our computer version of fitbit....  select sleep, then go to the daily stats, on the top right is a small box that says edit, select this then select sensitive or normal, hope ths helps
Regarding the broken graphs:  You don’t say which Fitbit you have, but some of them (I’m guessing yours is one) can automatically detect when you are sleeping without you manually putting it into sleep mode.  These same devices can also tell when you get up.  So that’s probably why you have 3 graphs instead of one.  When you got up at 5:30 and 7:35, the device detected movement that is beyond even wakeful in-bed movement and reported that you are up and about.  Then when you returned to bed it detected that you were resting again and restarting the tracking. Considering that and your description of the night, your graph looks reasonably accurate.  Note that “Time to fall asleep” is “0 min”, and yet your graph shows that you were awake for a while after you went to bed.  I find I get this result when I don’t put my Fitbit into sleep mode; so it makes me think yours was not in sleep mode, either.  Without putting it in sleep mode, it doesn’t know I’m in bed until it detects a lack of movement that is consistent with sleep or restless sleep.  That’s why it doesn’t detect the 30-60 minutes it actually takes me to fall asleep. As for the graph stripes:  I think this is actually a bug.  Every time that I’ve had more than one chart for one day, there is only one chart that looks solid.  I don’t think it means anything. You don’t mention if your Fitbit is on sensitive or normal setting.  Your sleep efficiency looks like mine after I switched to sensitive.  Do you feel rested when you wake up?  If it’s on normal now then if you set it to sensitive it might be all pink because of your tremor.  If it’s on sensitive now, and your tremor is causing all that red without waking you up, then changing it to normal might be more accurate. For comparison, here's one of my sleep graphs with two charts.  The first was my normal sleep for the night.  The second was after I realized I had the day off and rolled over to try to get back to sleep.  You can see that it reports 0 minutes to fall asleep, but the graph shows that it took me about 35 minutes to get back to sleep.
I'm on antidepressants too.  I keep my doctor apprised of any and all "symptoms" in case the meds need adjustment. I suggest that you talk to your doctor about your antidepressant ---- it may be too strong for you and may be causing the oversleeping.  Your doctor may be able to suggest a different antidepressant that won't cause this problem.  Good luck.  GoldaT.

Oh interesting! Mine was 86 and I had a good night's sleep (over 8 hours), but looking at the graph, not much deep sleep.

Distance is calculated simply by multiplying steps taken by your stride length. As your step counts seems ok, the issue must be with your stride. Fitbit uses defaults for walking and running strides based on your profile settings (height and gender). If the defaults are in use then it's worth checking that your profile settings are ok: https://www.fitbit.com/user/profile/edit You will also see the stride lengths on this page - if they are zero the defaults are in place. If they are not zero then they sound wrong. This article helps you sort them out: http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/How-do-I-measure-and-adjust-my-stride-length/
Thanks for your help, and a very good point. Especially after looking at the graph you posted. I'll say it anyway; kudos on that very healthy RHR of 56:)
Thanks. I've accepted this as a solution, since I didn't know about the one hour minimum (thought it was three, and didn't realize it was for stages 🙂I manually edited the start time to 9pm the previous day and the algorithm kind of figured it out -- it marked the time I was asleep as "light sleep" and the time I was working as "awake."Good enough, but I hope it's better at automatically detecting sleep.Hoping that once the sleep score beta ends, Fitbit will push the feature to the rest of us and that it will increase sleep tracking accuracy.
Hello,      I just started using Fitbit and I noticed a thing about the sleep tracker. So, if I sleep multiple times in a day the sleep tracker shows me the "sleep pattern" for only one time. Should'nt it be showing multiple "sleep patterns charts" ? I slept for 5 hours and woke up for about 5 mintues and slept back again for 3 hours. The fitbit showed only one sleep pattern chart. Could anybody tell me why I am missing my second sleep pattern chart for that night? Your help is highly appreciated. Thanks
My doctor seemed to think it was a Fitbit issue, not a health issue so I amignoring it, although it’s annoying. I have noticed that keeping my handsat shoulder level or below when I sleep helps. Joyce--Sent from my IPad. Please excuse typos,etc. Joyce
Some of the settings locations have recently been re-organized with most of what was in 'Advanced Settings' now under 'SETTINGS' on account page (tap profile pic from 'Today' page).But for sleep sensitivity, first be aware, for trackers with heart rate tracking, that setting is ignored - that was just for trackers without heart rate sensors that had to judge sleep from movement.But if you do still want it, I found it on the fitbit.com dashboard under 'Settings'.

Hello everybody! It's great to see that you've visited the Fitbit Community! @angeldooley I am very sorry to hear about the inconveniences you have experienced with your Fitbit Surge. Thank you for your patience during this process and for giving a second chance to our product. I would like to recommend a different workaround that might resolve your issue. The autodetect sleep mode on the Surge is based on your movement and your heart rate, so we can try working on the HR feature. Could you please measure your heart rate by following these instructions. Then, input your minimum and maximum heart beats here; under the "Heart Rate Zone". Please monitor your sleep once again to see if this resolves the issue. If not, you can turn off the heart rate monitor option here and try one more time to track your sleep. Please keep me informed what results you obtained after following the above instructions.  Thanks @SteveH @SunsetRunner @Gandhi for your great support!

Thank you. That's very clear and helpfulSent from my iPhone
Like you, I'm fed up with change for the sake of change ESPECIALLY when thechange is not an improvement.By contrast, it the change had been from what we have now to what we USEDto have, it would have been a wonderful change.I can only dream....
For gaming, I used a pair of Gunnars and they worked wonders! They are also useful just for looking at screens if you have a deskjob too or for any blue light filtering. These glasses really provide much more clarity on the screen. Also you can get them in prescription and come in a variety of styles.Just visit here. I got the Intercepts and they are really nice! 😄 Hope this helps.
My guess is you have auto recognize set for sleep, thus when you take your Fitbit off (it stops moving) it is recognizing that as sleep. Which would give you an inaccurate reading.

Any insight on this?  I am seeing the same thing.  Only getting basic sleep data on most nights.Heart is being tracked all night and there is nothing saying why I'm not seeing sleep data
It did not. I'm now at no sleep scores starting Jan 26th. The watch is working properly to record heart rate. I've tried every attempted fix for sleep scores I've read about here in these forums with no change. In addition to stopping and restarting the heart rate monitor with a watch restart in between, I've tightened and loosened the strap, moved it higher on my wrist, moved it to the inside of the wrist, and worn it on my dominant arm. Nothing fixes lack of sleep score tracking. Based on my experience and the number of those I've read about here I can only conclude there's something fundamentally wrong with sleep score tracking on these Fitbit watches. I'm still open to trying other potential remedies.
Hi Sanlyn ~Are you sure that your Flex is really going into sleep mode?  I've had a couple of times that I thought mine was in sleep mode but it wasn't.  You may want to try putting it in sleep mode from your phone instead of the actual device. Haven't had mine long, & overall I really like it, but the sleep mode is a pain.Good luck 🙂
Hi @LeoBueno, I would say that's a glitch. Unless you somehow figured out how to sleep 37 hours a day all month 😉 If you go into the daily sleep logs for March, you'll probably find where the problem occurred. If you want, you can edit that (or those) sleep log(s) and either delete them or edit the hours to something more reasonable.

I wonder where you guys are finding the efficiency % because, I don't see it anywhere (I'm on the fitbit one).
I definately think it's important for people to be aware of how you feel when you wake up; especially if they are getting a lower percentage of actual sleep no matter your age, overweight, underweigh, active or not. There is a significant number of people that don't realize they are not getting good sound sleep (many times undiagnosed sleep apnea) and wonder why they're in bed for 7-8 hours but still feel tired during the day. It's very highly documented in the medical field how the quality and amount of sound healing sleep is affecting our cardiovascular system and even type 2 diabetes.  The sleep feature is one of the reasons I bought mine.
I had this problem too for the first 2 days I had my Froce. On the first 2 days it stopped tracking my sleep 3 hours into the night. Then on the third day it just started working and has been fine since. I had a couple other things like that as well, like my alarm didn't go off on the first day and for some reason it's been working fine since then. I hope this helps... good luck.

I use the sleep funtion and find it to be very accuate. I did a sleep study with my doctor and they let me keep my fitbit on, and my results were almost identical. Love my "One"
Personally, I'm in bed between 21:30 and 22:00 most weekdays and up at 06:30 nearly every day. Though my sleep routine is a bit different at the moment as I'm writing a school project using some help of this resource https://writinguniverse.com/essay-format/ . Occasionally I’ll watch something on telly but invariably I scoot off to bed to watch it then fall asleep within 15 mins anyway.
I have sleep apnea. My Dr liked it at my last visit that many tracker had hourly information about my movements.

Hi there @slashflash2011, good to see you here in our Community. I imagine that waking up with small sounds and movements might be a nightmare. 
 
I was reading in the New York Time articles the difference in a sleeper’s reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called “sleep spindles.’’ A sleep spindle is a burst of high-frequency brain activity generated from deep inside the brain during sleep. (They are called spindles because the researchers who identified the brain wave pattern in the 1930s thought it resembled yarn wrapped around a dowel.) The source of the spindles is the thalamus, a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex.
 
I'm curious to know if you put in practice any method to avoid or reduce these symptoms?

Roberto | Community Moderator"Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.” What's Cooking?
How is sleep measured? Some nights is shows restlessness, other nights awake.  Some nights, I don't feel I've slept at all, but the stats say otherwise. Just curious how to read the information
I have the same issue - there are gaps as long as two hours and yet \i know \i wasn't awake.  I am going to change to normal mode to see if that makes a difference.
My log shows a perfect nights sleep with zero restless or wake ups and I know for a fact this is incorrect ....what is wrong?
Nvm found answer for those who also need help ill give you a quote and a link to help you 🙂There are a few scenarios where you might see your sleep pattern (which shows your time asleep, restless, and awake) instead of sleep stages:If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep?If you slept for less than 3 hours.If your device’s battery is critically low.

OK thanks. I've set up the conditional formatting too now.  Yes, I can see that would have affected things!
Why is my sleep not logged on an Alta when sleeping sitting up or propped up in bed? It won't log the sleep hours until I lie flat. It significantly reduces the number of sleep hours it counts each night.   Thanks!
Was able to 'edit' my sleep (Fitbit missed 3 hrs) but could not save.  How?
I find, sometimes, that my FibBit doesn't record accurately  --- I take it out of the wristband, clean the little "knobs" (points, whatever they are called) and replace it.  Then I sync it again and try the sleep logging again; usually this works.  G.
Alcohol greatly has an effect on sleep and your sleeping heart rate (as well as your overall resting heart rate if you're drinking that frequently).  I notice that I sleep worse and toss and turn a lot more when I've had wine before bed.  Therefore, I try to limit my alcohol consumption to only one or maybe two nights per week.  I need my sleep and absolutely hate feeling tired the next day.  Especially if I have to be focused and productive the next day, I don't drink the night before.   I'm not really a big drinker anyway and I can go weeks and months without alcohol, but it is nice around the holidays to have a festive glass of wine or two at night.

HI, i been useing fitbit for 4 months now .I found if you go on the dashboard. you can put the time you go to sleep in .and  when you wake up that works best for me . hope this helps.
Hi MarciM!Thank you for responding. My tracker monitors heart rate.....so......wherein the world would the fitbit get the sleep information?!??!
Whether you are actively working on a sleep goal or just tracking your sleep stages, have you noticed any patterns in lower quality sleep nights? Or conversely, anything that has really helped you improve your sleep?
 
Maybe it's bright summer nights, having young children or eating late before bed, we're curious to hear what you've noticed...
You can edit your sleep logs; delete one of them and edit the beginning or end time of the other one.

I woke up today at 6:45am and did my normal morning routine.  At that point in time, I checked my sleep tracker and I was impressed at how accurate it was.  It showed me waking up at 6:45am.  Awesome! I was playing around on the Dashboard during lunch and I noticed that my sleep time was a lot longer than I had expected.  Apparently, from 7:51am - 8:46am I was SLEEPING. It's odd because I was awake and doing work during that time.  I absolutely, without a doubt, was awake, but okay.  Fine.  I could understand if the device wasn't fitted properly or something of that nature and it didn't detect motion and assumed I was sleeping.  Cool.  Except that  six minutes and thirty seconds of that time was 'REM' sleep and the rest was 'Light' sleep.  I can't fathom what criteria it uses to determine these things but it's obviously not working.  Now I'm trying to edit the day that was incorrectly recorded but the website only says, 'If you edit your sleep you will lose sleep data....' but it doesn't really explain if I'll lose the entire day, or all the sleep data, or if I'll only lose the range I'm filtering out?   Anyway, pretty disappointed.  Has anyone had better experiences?  I'm debating returning and replacing it with a notepad where I write down when I go to sleep and when I wake up.
I am also interested in more on the mobile app. I have an LG optomus G and even with the blue tooth enabled it doesn't sync unless I am near my mac with the dongle thing. I can not get the mobile app to sync to my flex when away from the mac at all. would love to know how to use the sleep mode on and off from the mobile app too
Hi Tallullah,I got my Fitbit Sense 2 months ago and began a 10,000 step a day program.  My sleeping heart rate used to be pretty consistently lower than my resting heart rate but has gone up steadily since I started using it.  Last night, for the entire night, my sleeping heart rate was considerably higher than my resting heart rate.  I called my doctor who is putting me on a heart monitor to wear for a couple of weeks to be sure I am not having heart arrhythmias.  I hope I'm not making too much of this. John
I would like to try to use the Premium Membership again, but seems one 7-day trial is all you get. That's ok. So can anyone show me screenshots of what a few days sleep records looks like. I have OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) and stop breatheing 42 times in 60 minutes *GASP* so I am now on CPAP and sleep so much better w/pressure set at 10, and now trying to weaned off Ambien. I am under the care of a Sleep Doctor that is affilated with my Health Care Facility. She has me keeping a Sleep Diary and I was thinking... if I could provide her with information from Fitbit that might be of some benefit. I know the Fitbit records may not reflect a "True" view of my sleep history, but it would be consistant - be it right or wrong 🙂 So... I digress, can anyone provide me some snapshots of what I can expect should I purchase the Premium. Thanks!Leslie in frigid Michigan
Mine has stopped showing sleep results the next day. If I get online, I can see something, but I much prefer to see it on my Versa 2. Anybody know why this particular function isn't showing?

That's great. What I'm telling you, though, is you can't get "sleep quality" and "sleep stages" both--they are totally different things in the world of Fitbit. You have to choose, and the choice will greatly help you decide which model to get. If you get an HR-enabled Fitbit, you can turn off HR when you want to see sleep quality, or leave it on when you want sleep stages. But it can't do both simultaneously. All the Fitbits I've used are the same in terms of sleep accuracy. Fitbit doesn't advertise any of the models as being more accurate that way, so you're free to choose almost any of them. Here's some more information you may find helpful:https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163

OK, so it changed the amount of time it thinks I slept, and doesn’t do the nice graph for the decreased sleep quantity? Very confused new user here.
I work 12 hour night shifts. I find it best to get up earlier (before work) and exercise then. It keeps you more awake during the shift and I go straight to bed when I get home.
I am sick of this thing i have a flex when i go to bed and put it in sleep mode then when i get up i take it out of sleep mode. When I go to the dashboard it reads went to bed at 9 pm up at 6am  in bed 9 hours awake 12 times  actual sleep time 9 hours 100percent sleep. It use to tell me how long to go to sleep how many times restless awake and actual sleep time. This can not be correct as i get up to go to the bathroom at least 2times.
Yeah, there are over 2000 votes for them to release the feature already on the "feature request forum" and it's only set to 'under consideration'.  Not sure how something you advertised as a feature of the device can only be 'under consideration' after people paid to have that feature.  Lots of angry people considering the 2000 some votes mean individual people that wanted this feature and don't have it.  If each person tells 2 or 3 of their friends that Fitbit lies that's going to be a lot of people not buying a Fitbit.  Especially now that you basically have to pay to get access to your own stats.  So ridiculous at this point.

However, for someone who has been diagnosed with OSA and is required to document compliance with CPAP usage, it's not to be compared in anyway with the data being produced by the CPAP device. As a side note, it's my understanding that Fitbit has developed the platform with software which can integrate and utilize their wearable devices as a nocturnal pulse oximetry device. They haven't decided whether they're ready to turn that function on yet(?)

I found that when I changed my sleep tracking settings from "normal" to "sensitive" it dramatically changed what it said my sleep was like.  Possibly check the settings and see if it's set to sensitive tracking.

My sleep data doesn't start tracking until 1 1/2-2 hours after I start trying to go to sleep and think I have been asleep.
Here is a helpful URL I found in my sleep tracker graph: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/Sleep-tracking-FAQs#Whatisthedifference
I've been working overnight shift (8pm-6am) for about 7 years now, my husband for 24 years.  Once you're not switching back and forth,  you'll probably find that you will sleep better.  Get dark-out shades, or an eye mask (all the cool kids are wearing them these days).  I personally only get about 5 hours of sleep on days when I've worked the night before (my Fitbit keeps telling me to go to bed earlier, but I go to bed when I get home!), but it's mostly because my dogs wake me up and want to start their day (can't really blame them).  My husband easily sleeps 8-10 hours during the day (don't get me started!).  Adding consistent daily exercise or activity vastly improves my energy levels as well, so try to keep up some sort of activity schedule (I know the feeling .. too tired to exercise and fatigued from no exercise - but try to do what you can to get started). Good luck!!
Interesting story, @Moneylogue - we are all different. I’ve always needed less sleep than my hubby. And there is no sleeping in for me. No matter what time I go to sleep, I’m awake by 7:30 am - which I guess is sleeping in compared to my pre-retirement days when I was up by 5:00 am.

Hello.
I am using google pixel watch (latest as od  Jan, 2023) and google pixel 7 pro as my mobile device. I have premium subscription.
I also gave microphone access to the app.
Yet still I dont see any snoring related tracking. I tried resetting/reconnecring my pixel watch. I tried reijstalling application and restarting phone. I checked fitbit setting both on the phone and oj the pixel watch device yet I see no snoring related oprion or tracking data.
Can someone help with this?
Thanks.

I feel tired and have black circles around my eyes. I do crossfit 3 to 4 times a week.
Thanks for the response - I swtiched the setting back to normal and kept it on the dominant hand and the sleep efficiency went right back to where it was when it was normal on the non-dominant hand (around 95-98%).  I know that I wasn't asleep for longer portions of the night last night, but the device didn't catch any of that - it assumed that just because I was being still, I was asleep.  Again, don't think I am as restless as the sensitive setting would indicate (there are long periods - 20-30 minutes of restless activity when I have it on sensitive that I am pretty sure my wife would pick up on), but the normal setting doesn't seem accurate either.
Remember that the fitbit considers rolling over 'waking up'. The point overall is to show you how you move through the stages of sleep. When you are in the lighter stages you will naturally move around in bed, shift arms, roll over, etc. While in the deeper stages of sleep you are more likely to remain still. Most people go through the stages over and over each night in about a 90 minute cycle. So if you see that you were 'awake' about every 90 minutes you were most likely moving through the stages properly and rolled over. Also, if you sleep with someone the fitbit often registers _their_ movement on your graph.
Recently purchased my Charge 3, and have yet to successfully track a night's sleep. No neat little graph lines showing sleep stages--just a bar on each of the last two days showing 1 1/2 hrs of sleep when I was asleep from 11pm to 0630. On the watch face, scrolling up to sleep data, it says sleep not tracked. So what am I doing wrong?
I have days where I took screen shots of the heart rate graph earlier, and now they are blank. It's almost like if I look at particular nights too many times the graph gets wiped out! This is really frustrating, because I'm trying to align the heart rate data with my cpap machine data, and so the graphs I've looked at a bunch of times are the ones that have the most interesting and valuable data on them! I'm about to buy a recording pulse oximeter and give up on the Fitbit as a useful data device.
in sleep mode what determines restless?
As far as I'm concerned the sleep score is nonsense. Look at this example:  How can it be that Wednesday got a 68, only 6 less than Tuesday? I felt so bad the entire day. I was cognitively impaired. I couldn't remember what I was doing at work, I kept zoning out and found it difficult to concentrate, my eyes were sore and itchy and heavy. But according to Fitbit it wasn't too bad! How does it work that out? I fell asleep at 4am, got only 24 minutes of deep sleep. On Tuesday I had 2 hours of deep sleep, and almost double the amount of total sleep. How can the scores be so close? It's useless as an indicator of anything. Edit: also I wonder what you would have to do to get 100. Is it even possible? I've never seen above 86 since they introduced sleep scores. And what would one have to do to get below 50 or 30? My lowest is 65. If you get less than 3 hours then it doesn't track it. So is it not really a scale from 0-100 at all?
@Kvetcher   I agree with @NellyG.  Fitbit's Help article doesn't list sleep goal as one of the factors used in sleep score calculation.

Hi there,If your sleep logging is becoming problematic, please make sure your sensitivity is set to Normal, not Sensitive. You can also switch your tracker's mode into "Dominant", which decreases sensitivity.If that doesn't work, then I would suggest manually tracking sleep using the app.I had your problem with sleep logging because my sensitivity was on Sensitive mode.Have a nice day — let me know the outcome!
You know whats funny? I am ALWAYS below Resting heart rate when I sleep typically 75-90% is below resting and my average bpm is anywhere between 50-57...my natural resting heart rate is very low bc im athletic and very active, so its always been that way BUT...just right now I looked at my sleep pattern from last night- granted, I did not sleep long enough at all but it said 100% of my heart rate was ABOVE...uhhhh...that has NEVER happened while using my fitbit (and its been years). I'm hoping this is just a glitch bc I find that a bit alarming. 100%?? and my avg bpm was 80! ....im beyond confused. 😕
I have averaged 60% range since getting my Fitbid (for Christmas 2016) which I think is terrible.@LindaF wrote:I am just curious what others are getting as a sleep efficiency score. I am averaging a 92 percent efficiency.
@digitll You are correct.. But you have nothing to lose by editing the sleep log and changing the wake time. When you do this you can analyse the sleep even if it only gives you the old graph. I have had success joining the sleep records when I get an old graph and new graph on the same night.. I delete the old graph and adjust the times..

This is SO helpful, thank you!!Yes, if anyone at Fitbit is reading this, PLEASE revert to old settings or make it customizable. This would almost be a deal breaker for me with Fitbit since sleep averages is a primary use of the app for me.
Hiya, thanks for responding.I sleep about 8 hours (I know, lucky me!) And last night for example I got 1 hour 38 mins rem (16%) and 29 mins deep.Previous night 1hr 15 rem (13%) and 59 mins deep. It often doesn't tell me percentages as so low. Maybe I wear my tracker too loosley??Thanks!
Fitbit has definitely helped me sleep better.  I have had difficulty with sleep for quite awhile now.  By using fitbit my doctor and I have been able to come up with a treatment plan that has improved my sleep.  We were able to identify the problem.  I think it's funny that one of the first things my doctor asks me for is my sleep log from the app.  I had hoped to get in on the beta Lab but I was too slow.
Hi @Katotina @LongRoad @Roessie! I'm glad you've found your way to the "Improve Your Zzzs" Discussion board. 
 
I understand what you mean about wanting to write notes for your nightly sleeps. There are some other Fitbit users who have also had this same thought! Please check out this feature request for adding a sleep comments field and vote on it if it's something you'd like to see added.
 
In the interim, something you could do is use a "sleep diary." I did a quick search and found this template, but I'm sure there are many on the internet or in stores that you could find.
 
Let me know what you all think of these ideas, and if I can help in any way!

I've been tracking for a month now and I seem to get somewhere between 10-20 minutes of deep sleep a night, even when I sleep 8 hours. I have always been a very tired feeling person all the time and I'm wondering if this deep sleep tracking is (1) accurate, (2) a sign I should see a doctor? Also, I have little kids and, while they're not waking me up necessarily at night, I wonder if my vigilance about them is keeping me from resting fully? Anyone have experience with very little deep sleep?
I have never heard of this before. Is this a study you are quoting or sharing your experience?

Does anyone else’s heart rate go above resting once they fall asleep and then come back down when they wake up?It’s consistently like this for me unless I’ve had an extended period of time off from work. Could it be stress related?For reference my resting is 61. At its worst, my heart rate has been somewhere around 88 while sleeping and then drops back down when I’m awake.
Ugh - just tried to post the new challenge idea to the Feature Request Forum, but for some reason the system would not accept my post from my IPad. I will try again later when I am back to my computer.
Hi, @dasboot , the sleep score gives quite a heavy weighting for your heartrate. As you may know, Fitbit calculates resting heartrate a little differently from most methods.   The conventional way of calculating resting heartrate js your heartrate first thing in the morning when you first wake up, but before you have got out of bed and exerted yourself in any way. In contrast, Fitbit takes an average of your heartrate throughout the day when you are quiet (no recent steps detected).  From thar it gives you a daily resting heartrate. For the “sleep score” it looks at the amount of time when your heartrate was at, or below, your calculated resting heartrate.  It combines that with the other information, like what per cent was REM, Deep, light, awake, and gives you a score for that sleep.   So, although on another occasion you may have slept longer, if the percentages weree lower, and your heartrate higher the “sleep score” will reflect an indication that that sleep (whatever its duration) was less restful, and therefore you will get a lower score. It is just another piece of information, along with sleep timing, your sleep stages, benchmarks, etc. I hope this helps to make it clearer!

I recently started using a cpap with the same equipment. I'm experiencing the same issues... I wondered if others were experiencing that too.
i would say when you wake up feeling refreshed - matter of fact you need to train yourself and get to bed earlier - i am actually doing so much better in the sleep department - ever since i got this Fitbit

Eric Fitbit.  I do realize that resting heart rate can change based on quite a number of conditions.  I do think, however, that when changes occur coincident with changes/updates to your program that the accuracy of your estimates are suspicious.  In my case my RHR has been relatively consistent for well over a year, with the exception of one short illness.  And, based on my own comparison of my exercise heart rate graphs with those from my Polar Chest Strap device, fitbit heart rate data is often just plain wrong.
I think the watch only tracks about 1/2 of my arousals during the night.
yes make sure your fully wound down from your day before you go to bed and if you keep the tv on during the night find the most boring channel to have running in the background
You might think about your mattress too. How old is it? Is it too hard or too soft? Perhaps something as simple as flipping it over might help.
It will track anytime but needs at least 1 hour to detect nap, and 3 hours to get sleep stages. Not officially approved, but I have found if I'm going to take a shorter (less than an hour) nap, I can use the 'Begin Sleep Now' to get it logged as sleep. Also note sleep is always credited to the day you wake up.

"They" say we should get 8 hours of sleep, and Fitbit will report the net sleep (total sleep time - time awake). So, should we try to get 8 hours of net sleep (e.g., 10PM--6:50AM with ~50min awake time) or 8 hours of total sleep (e.g., 10PM--6AM even though there was ~50 min awake time)? Has this ever been officially addressed by sleep doctors, given such contemporary fitness tracker information? Given all the non-sleep factors for daytime health/fatigue/will-power feelings, I don't think I can detect whether ~50 minutes of awake time makes much difference (assuming around 8 hours total sleep time), but will try for more sleep if recommended.

You can edit the sleep loggin in the app.  I tend to do it when I have a stretch of being up at night.   I usually edit the first one to end at the end of the last log that was created and then delete the extraneous logs.

I have also been having this issue for the past two nights.  Being able to track the sleep stages was one of the main reasons I purchased the Alta HR, so I hope this is resolved soon.
My fitbit charge 4 stopped tracking sleep and I tried all suggestions on the community to get it working again but nothing helped. The last 2 weeks I've been doing the Relax for 2 minutes before I go to sleep, not only do I fall to sleep quicker but my charge 4 is now tracking my sleep once again

It can be hard to find a good specialist in some areas, I struggled to find a good traumatologist to get my back checked when I was in intense pain, but I was eventually lucky enough to find one that was able to help me. 
 
I'm sorry to see that you're still struggling to find a cardiologist that you trust, but it's good to know that you've found your Fitbit device helpful to keep track of your heart rate. 😁

If I drink too much water in the evening I tend to get RLS.  Sometimes I do take the klonopin, but only if I can sleep in in the morning.  Even a low dose makes me really groggy in the AM.I also found that increasing my magnesium helped with the restless legs.  A blood test came back with low Mg, even with supplements.  If you start taking Mg go slow!  It can cause serious intestinal upset if you have too much at once.Congrats on getting back to ground zero!
Here's last night on sensitive: And the same data on Normal. Still fighting with a sleep disorder but there's been improvements. Looking at the overall data, I bought the fitbit in June when I started a sleep restriction/sleep hygiene program. The hygiene work has had the most benefit (fairly stable bedtime each night, no electronics near my bed, blackout curtains, a new mattress) but there's still a ways to go - now I'm trying to get used to cpap. I think the real nightly number today is somewhere in between Sensitive and Normal but some of those early June days were definitely an hour to hour and half of real sleep. I fell into a pattern last year where I couldn't sleep past 3AM for months on end; my second half of the night is still worse than the first chunk of sleep but at least I do fall back asleep.
Hi @Trying2getfittt, If you click through the sleep tile, in the sleep section, you should see a "Benchmark"  tab for your age group. That would be a good place to start. To me, it looks a little light on deep sleep and heavy on light sleep, but if you feel rested in the morning, I wouldn't worry too much about it.

Hey all! I have recently received my second covid 19 vaccine. I’m not having many side effects just groggy, tired, and have a sore arm. But when I sleep whoooaa. I  have added two different nights SPO2 graphs. One from the night before the vaccine and one the night after. The vaccine is so new there is not much about it out there. They say it does not affect your breathing but as you can tell it does!! Just stating a thread to see if anyone else’s has gotten the vaccine and what your Fitbit is telling you!

I gave some thoughts on this subject earlier but wanted to add.  Yes i know it isn’t a sedative sleep aide. It’s like our natural melatonin our brain sends out when it’s near bed time.  I darkened my room 1&1/2 hours before bed to help bring on my natural melatonini take the 3 mg cut it in half and the 1.5 cut that in half due to the anxiety of the 3mg causes.  The 1/2 of the 1/2  is just my speed. No anxiety or nervousness with this amount and it’s the one that dissolves under the tongue.  I found the right amount of melatonin for me. 😊
I have sleeping troubles.  After hearing more and more about adding terpenes, I started to wonder if there could be some value to beat insomnia. Any experiences?
@Noire7 That's the same that I do if I didn't sleep well. Normally a one hour nap helps me to recover energy.

Hello @Cubs27 You should check all 3 components of your sleep score: Duration (time asleep & awake), Quality (time in REM & Deep sleep stages), and Restoration (Sleeping heart rate & restlessness). Although you slept 30 minutes less, you could have spent more time in REM & Deep sleep which would give you a higher score. If you also had more time below your sleeping heart rate & weren't so restless, that would also give you a higher score. Hope this helps clarify what you're seeing with your sleep score. Click here to learn more about: Fitbit sleep score

Hello all.  I am very new to this and have a question regarding sleep mode.  I have followed instructions on how to turn sleep mode on when going to sleep.  And as far as I thought I did the right thing.  So off to sleep I go.  In the morning I Turn it off as per instructions and it all seems to work ok.  However, when I log onto my dashboard it tells me that there was no sleep recorded.  Now my question is. Do we have to manually put down the time we go to bed and anticapated time we want to wake, before we turn on our flexfit?  Hope you understood the question, and hope someone can help?

That is a great idea @Jsand3! I usually sleep in later than intended, and end up being late for something! I am kind of a heavy sleeper, and the phone alarms don't wake me up, so I will probably get one that is pretty loud
Hi.. I have the same problem as your wife and I'm really concerned that no-one anywhere... not even in scientific journals seems to have any answers. In fact, no-one seems to even be talking about the issue. As soon as I fall asleep my heartrate starts climbing (around 20 bpm higher)  - usually for the first two hours of sleep. After that it comes down really really slowly and may eventually reach my daytime resting heartrate levels. My % below resting heartrate measure on the fitbit is usually around 4-15%.  I have done so much research and tried various supplements (magnesium, antioxidants) to see if I can nudge the dial, but nothing. The only thing I can't test/ try to influence myself is hormone levels, which I have a sneaky suspicion might be playing a role. Does your wife's nighttime resting heartrate follow her menstrual cycle? Ie does it fall at start of her period and then gradually go up and up throughout her cycle? Mine does... again.. changes about 10bpm over the month. I really really want to  find an answer to this as I rarely feel rested when I wake up... even after sleeping 7-8 hours almost every night. If anyone has any clues.. please help!I've tried speaking to my doctor, who rang  a heart specialist, but he didn't even want to acknowledge that this is unusual/ not normal and worth investigating.
I use sleep cycle.  I like it.  It uses your movement on the mattress to figure out how soundly/not your are sleeping.  I think it has a better/more useful graph than the fitbit & the alarm attempts to wake you up at an appropriate point in your sleep cycle. It has a good snooze mode. Generally 'good' nights sleep contain regular periods of deep/not deep sleep.  It doesn't tell you minutes awake/restless.
I don't think Fitbit uses heart rate to determine sleep.  I could be wrong, but everything I've seen suggests they use the same algorithms for all their devices.  So the ones with heart rate monitors track sleep the same as the ones without.  I've seen a lot of complaints about this because the sleep monitoring could probably be more accurate if heart rate was part of the equation and it's not. The only way to detect REM is by monitoring brain waves.  Fitbit can't do it.  Other devices have been able to get respectable sleep detection results by combining movement with heartrate, temperature, and perspiration.  But even those can't detect REM. This article has an interesting discussion about the limitations of mass-market sleep trackers:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-christopher-winter/sleep-tips_b_4792760.html
Sure! Depending on which FitBit you have, there is a way to track your sleep. read to see.

I have charge 5. Last night it said awake at 2:30 AM and the night before at 3:15. I did get up to use the bathroom. But then it stops tracking sleep. I bought this specifically for sleep tracking. I know of no other settings to make it continue. Anyone else?
Hello everyone. @peggys123 Welcome to the community forums. 
 
I'm sorry for the experience and thank you for the information and for the steps you've tried prior to posting. Please make sure that your Fitbit device is currently paired to your Fitbit account, but if it's not paired, I recommend setting it up one more time by following the steps here: How do I set up my Fitbit device?
 
Once your Fitbit device is set up, please try to add the Sleep tile. For more information about how to add tiles, check: How do I use the Fitbit app?
 
Hope this helps.

I have the Sense, and mine says "No Data" for: Breathing RateHeart Rate Variability Skin Temperature  I wish I would have waited to buy this until we saw how well it actually works.  Now you can buy it for $50 cheaper. Bummed.
Fitbit support has replied in Twitter: "Meanwhile, your EOV graph is located under sleep stages in the Fitbit app, or, if you’re a premium subscriber, it’s on the Restoration tab under your sleeping heart rate information. If you don’t see your EOV graph, note that you must get sleep stages while wearing your Charge 3. Hope this helps and we're just a tweet away if you need additional assistance." It looks like fitbit support believed the EOV graph is available already.
First off I would think if you were in bed for 8-9 hrs and only asleep 1-3hrs you would be very aware of this fact. That's not much sleep. My guess is your fitbit is probably faulty. Good way to test is have someone else sleep with it and see what they get.
The alarm does not currently pay attention to sleep stages, though that has often been requested.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I was averaging 6 hours of sleep each night prior to the sleep stages update, the moment the update appeared on my charge 2, I see an average of 8 hours each night.  Honestly, nothing has changed in my sleep habits.  What might be happening here?
I am having a the same (similar) problem with the start time.  It is routinely >1 hour late in starting.
Rebooted it. No change. Wearing it in exactly the same way always have. This has to be due the update that occurred the day that the change in sleep recording occurred.Gwennie Sent from my iPad
Try putting back the original sleep times. Has worked for me in the past. You got the sleep whether fitbit says so or not so don't let it put you off your plan.

	Something is better than nothing. Be happy 🙂
Sleep stages are not being recorded int detail.... so there is no record of the amount of deep sleep for example.  This seems to be an intermittent problem, but annoying nonetheless
When you sync it you could look to see if there was a change in patterns - heartbeat a lot slower one night than another, or really restless sleep, but it's not medical equipment. Think someone here reported they recharged their fitbit one night yet saw 'sleep activity' when they synced it. You can use it as a pointer, but don't rely on it for medical decisions.
The 'craziness' of them wasn't obvious to me, but maybe to another; also kinda hard to see detail at that scale picture.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
The fitbit products can't determine if you are sleeping or watching TV. The software needs a switch turned on - the double tap. The question was why can it be automatic? One user expressed his satification with having to manualy enter into sleep mode. I disagee with his assessment that its easy to use, it is most definitely NOT. As another pointed out there is lack of input data to ensure accuracy. The Basis tracker has heart rate monitoring along with perspiration sensors and can determine when the wearer is sleeping. The answer? The Force would need more sensors to do it automatically  i.e. Higher Price.

Hi There, I just got the charge 2 with HR and was wondering... I haven't used it for sleep yet. I was wondering since heart rate changes during sleep apnea episodes, if the Fitbit would at least tell you if you HR went up over night and could give you an idea of when and how many times? I also use a Snore App on my phone which records all snoring sounds - kinda scary!

@cindylike24I didn't mean to come across as confrontatonal. Part of the problem with written language vs verbal.
This is last night:
I used to have the same problem, but I found that avoiding technology for half an hour before I went to bed and not going to bed until I was barely able to keep my eyes open, then putting the radio on to my favourite channel and reading a magasine or book until I was on the verge of falling asleep really helped me. Recently my hubby told me about the "night light" thingy on Windows 10 where it dulls your screen at a certain time (mine is set to 7.30pm to 7am but you need to set yours to what works for you) has helped me too. Basically if, like me, you're using technology right up until you go to bed, your brain is functioning and not relaxing so it's stopping you from falling asleep. I've also set the reminder on my Fitbit to tell me when I should start getting ready for bed.  It takes a few days and a different night time routine, but small changes make big differences!

Hi @FidRewe When setting an alarm, turn on Smart Wake to allow your watch to find the besttime to wake you starting 30 minutes before the alarm time you set. It avoidswaking you during deep sleep so you're more likely to wake up feeling refreshed. IfSmart Wake can’t find the best time to wake you, your alarm alerts you at the settime.
I can see this being simply answered by going to bed the same time and waking up the same time every day or , no devices 30 min before bed, but I deal with many uncontrolled factors when trying to get sleep and its really starting to bug me how little  deep sleep I get ! whats normal for deep sleep any way ? if I'm not getting good sleep am I just wasting  too much time trying ? cause if I'm trying to sleep and i have 9 hrs attempting this but only 45min to an 1h20 is deep sleep is it worth it ? take Monday as an example i got 5hrs 28 m of sleep 3h22 light 1 hr deep , 1 hr6 rem sleep .here are some of the reasons i don't sleepi work nights , i have the black out curtains but it doesn't keep all light outi live with 5 other people none of which are on the same schedule as methere is a dog in the home that barks often and loudlyand an inconsistent temp makes it hard to get comfortable .what should I do ? and does anyone else know my pain of being on graveyard shift ?
It's a bit uncomfortable to wear to bed, and I'd rather preserve my Flex battery life 😁
I was wondering the exact same thing and went on a search... Recommendations by National Sleep Foundation:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29073398Adults 7 - 9 hours is recommended, and 6-10 hours may be appropriate for some individuals Quote: "Adult: 26-64 yearsOverall health and well-being, as well as cognitive, emotional, and physical health, were considered when voting on appropriate sleep durations for adults. Seven to 9 hours of sleep per day is recommended for adults by the Panel. Results indicate that the Panel believed that slightly shorter sleep durations might be sufficient for emotional health. Both convincing and weaker scientific evidence for adults informed the Panels’ recommendations. The Panel recognized that sleep deprivation is widespread and increasing in the adult population. Restricted sleep time particularly affects 45- to 54-year-olds, the age range when time at work usually reaches its maximum in the life span. Sleep deprivation’s adverse effect on multitasking performance, weight regulation, job safety, mental health, sugar regulation, blood pressure, and cardiovascular health was noted, particularly with nighttime sleep deprivation during the workweek."   The appropriate sleeping time per individual apparantly can only be determined by "how you feel".In other words, you need more sleep in case of: Impaired memory, difficulty solving problems, trouble focusing, depression, weakened immune system, fatigue, increased pain, etc. In a 2013 poll, the average hours of sleep needed to function best varied per country:6h58 jJapan, 7h13 US, 7h20 UK, 7h22 Canada, 7h31 Germany, 8h15 Mexicohttps://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-polls-data/other-polls/2013-international-bedroom-poll In general 7,5 hours of asleep time seems to be the concensus across difference sources (with a minimum of 7, and often 8 hours is cited), The Psychomotor Vigliance Test (PVT) has been found to correlate well with fatigue.However, the test can be taken for different durations, and all durations are not comparable amongst eachother (so use always the same test). So, to test your fatigue after a nights sleep to determine your actual fatigue/sleep need might be interesting, this can be done here:http://www.sleepdisordersflorida.com/pvt1.html#responseOut I can't find a good source to state what makes for a good Sleep Efficiency (the time spend in bed that you are actually sleeping), but one source claims that 85% is considered to be normal, above 90% very good, and below 85% poor:Sleep Efficiency:https://www.verywellhealth.com/sleep-efficiency-3014912 You can train to increase your Sleep Efficiency by all the known recommendations, but also by CBT, first restricting your time in bed to time asleep, and then slowly increasing it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy_for_insomnia  General information on how to interpret a sleep study can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246141/ If I look at the Fitbit benchmark (which is different per age group and gender), I end up with a normal awake percentage of 5-20%, thus a Sleep Efficiency of 80 - 95%. So let's take the 85% Sleep Efficiency, which is considered to be normal, together with the recommended asleep time of 7,5 hours:If 7,5 hours is 85% of time in bed, this means that you need to stay in bed for 8 hours and 49 minutes to get the minimum recommendation, In conclusion... Also I am quite shocked at this... devoting 9 hours a day to sleep on top of a full time job every day is quite demanding.  (AKA: If up at 6 = bed at 21, up at 7 = bed at 22, up at 8 - bed at 23). I am curious on how other people tackle this... do they really spend 9 hours in bed?

Hello @WallyBit Welcome to the community forums! 
 
There are some factors that could prevent your Fitbit device to track your Sleep Stages. I'd recommend taking into consideration the following information: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
Hope this helps!

The sleep score system is entirely useless.. I'm assuming it's out of 100? I got 4 hours 53 minutes last night and get a score of 69, this is utterly ridiculous. 8 hours is what you're meant to get as an adult (please refer to why we sleep by Matthew Walker, a leading sleep expert). If it was a simple % based system I'd score 61 but considering less than 6 hours a night on a regular basis is considered detrimental to health I don't feel this is an accurate representation. Please bring back average time per week.
@Steve2744 Thanks for your reply.

Obstructive sleep apnea. Get checked out in a sleep clinic.
Even later to this thread...I just got the Charge 2 a few months ago, and my readings on deep sleep are below average--averaging 7%.  REM seems to be within range.  Am concerned about it because although deep sleep is supposed to go down as we age, I'm being compared to folks my age (so the range is 8 to 16%).  I do have memory issues, and I think it may be related to my lack of deep sleep.  I think it would be helpful if Fitbit included another statistic to show total amount of sleep compared to my average, and then to the population I'm being compared to, in addition to the stages.  I know everyone needs a different amount of sleep, but if my average is 6 hours and I'm worried about it, I'd rest easier (no pun intended!) if I knew the population was only getting 5:45 on average.
Hi @johncooper, There are plenty of people who are night-owls. Work, insomnia, or just enjoying the quiet night time are some reasons. I've done it before, but it messes with my rhythms a bit, and sometimes the noise and light during the day are distracting. Do you use blackout curtains or a sleep mask to make it dark?

No, that is NOT my problem. Quick view is off! I must move around a lot and tap it or accidentally push the button. It still lights up the room. I want to COMPLETELY disable the light at night.
This is how their back compare:  Although they use the same technology, as pointed out by @WavyDavey, the elements used to measure HR are not layed out in the same way.

Hey @cbess Checkout the Feature Request board https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/idb-p/features There are several that have been proposed around tracking caffeine intake and you can vote for the one you like. The more votes, the more likely Fitbit developers will consider adding the feature!
Purchase a night able motion camera with audio.  Set-it up on a tripod and film yourself sleeping.  I discovered that I have very restless limbs and was constantly moving them and waking myself without even remembering.  Then I went to a sleep centre and fond out I have severe apnoea - shock!I, like you, still live in a constant state of fatigue but at least I know why. I also dream a lot (my stress levels are pretty high) so I'm sure that is also part of the problem.

While sleeping, my "Heart Rate Zone" chart consistently shows a dramatic spike in heart rate (>140) at almost exactly the same time every night - between 1:30 am and 2 am, and almost always between 1:40 am and 1:50 am. I looked back over the past 14 nights and 13 of them had this spike during this time period. Heart Rate Zone Chart  However, this spike is not shown at all on the normal "Heart Rate" chart, or in the dashboard online. Heart Rate Chart  Online Dashboard These charts all are exactly the same - except for the unexplained spike while sleeping. Also, the portion in the "Heart Rate Zone" tile that shows "When you got your minutes" never includes the overnight elevated heart rate. Why wouldn't they match? Is the "Heart Rate Zone" chart more granular than the other two, showing a true spike every night? Or is it a glitch in the "Heart Rate Zone" chart since the other two do not corroborate it? I have a Fitbit Vera, Version 71.6.19. I don't drink alcohol so that's not a potential reason for the fluctuation at night.
I'm not sure how a cellphone handles it  but on Dashboard if you mouseover a tile then click the See More option it takes you to a sleep overview page giving dates, times, and sleep lengths. If you click the > icon for any of these you then get a breakdown for that night - a line graph you can mouseover to see times you were in each stage, and a bar graph below giving you percentages for each of the 4 stages plus number of times you were awake. Not sure how this translates to cellphone, or even if cellphone offers the same functionality but worst case scenario you can always use your browser to access Dashboard.

Sleep all night become really hard since the birth of my daughter, even if she sleep well enough for a baby.
 
Also, I used to read but noticed that sometimes in bed I was thinking about what I just read. My phone was also a big distractor. Of course bad sleep was affecting me in my day to day. 
 
I read that for help children to sleep early prepare the environment is important, I think it worked for her but still having issues to sleep all night. I guess now it's about bad habits so I made some changes.
 
As for her I prepare my own environment doing things like :

No phone once I'm in bed. I turn Off the notifications.
No TV or reading.
Like some of you mentioned above, no coffee, tea or chocolate after 5PM. 
I follow the same routine every night.  

Finally, I have to recognize that I slept better when I was going to the gym.

I got my first fitbit yay! and I find he sleep chart to be confusing. I read there are 4 sleep cycles:Stage 1: NREM it means you are kinda of awake but drifting to sleepStage 2: Light sleep. This is went your body gets cold, your heart rate decreases, and your brain activities slowdownStage:3:Transition into deep sleep and deep sleep - During deep sleep, your breathing, heartbeat, body temperature, and brain waves reach their lowest levels. Your muscles are extremely relaxed, and you are most difficult to rouse.Stage 4: Deepest sleep stage! Also known as the healing stage, when tissue growth and repair take place, important hormones are released to do their jobs, and cellular energy is restored. and then there is a stage 5, which is the REM sleep! and boy! magic happens there! you are almost awake! your eyes are rolling, you start dreaming and your body is paralyzed to stop you from acting! Come to Confusing Part: fitbit displays that your sleep goes from deep to light to REM!? I think it should be displayed from Deep to REM. In other words, REM should be displayed on the vertical axis below Deep and not above it.. unless you go back to sleep light before entering REM.... Thoughts?
I woke up in the morning ,  but I stayed in bed for 15 more minutes, but not sleeping. My fitbit insprie hr counted it as restless time, and reduced my sleep score.  Does anyone know how to avoid this? Because this way the calculation  is totally inaccurate. Thank you.
Buying a new mattress is really a tough job. I mean you need to check out many things just to find a mattress which helps you to get proper sleep.Yes, It is really awkward to lie down and give try to the mattress before you plunk down the credit card.still, I can give advice like sit on the edge of the mattress to get a feel for its firmness. and if you are looking for a mattress for a couple and you both have to must try.Before buying a mattress just confirm the returns and trial periods.

Hi @MissStone First, you should know, it's completely normal to log much more light sleep than deep sleep. Nobody really gets more deep sleep than light--our bodies aren't designed for that. Usually we get between 10-25% of our sleep as deep sleep, depending on our ages. Many of us try to maximize the amount of deep sleep we get to help the  body's repair and maintenance. Check out this thread for tons of tips on how to do this.

Hello @Joe.FIT Welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thank you very much for the detailed information! To help improve your sleep score, work on your overall sleep habits, heart health, and activity levels:
 

Exercise earlier in the day or at least 3 to 4 hours before you go to sleep (source).
Maintain a consistent sleep schedule (source). For more information, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
Meet the CDC’s recommended 150 active minutes per week (source).



For additional tips on improving your sleep routine and quality, see How can I use my Fitbit device to sleep better?. On a side note, Sleep score ranges are:
 

Excellent: 90-100
Good: 80-89
Fair: 60-79
Poor: Less than 60



Hope this helps!

I'll second this. Before my actual sleep study they gave me this device that slipped over my thumb (I think) that gave them a rough measure of what was going on. This was followed by an actual sleep study because why not more tests but I was astounded at the amount of information generated by that first test. If you need a CPAP though it really is life changing. I stopped falling asleep while driving the car around town and I could pay attention again. Don't hesitate if you need one and don't be afraid to price shop. My insurance charged a copay that was almost triple what the same supplies cost online and my CPAP machine itself cost me about 1.5 times more than just buying it outright. Add what they're probably gouging the insurance company and they're making bank!
I have searched high and low to find answers to this dilemma.  I have also contacted the FitBit chat help line and have reported this repeatedly, but have never found an answer to this issue. I have the FitBit Sense (only about 6 months old) and use an iPhone.  My Sense works great in almost every way.....except when it comes to sleep tracking.  When it works, it reports everything fully...and seems to be accurate.  The problem is that, every week or so, I will have one or two nights when the sleep tracking will randomly stop.  For example, last night, I fell asleep around 8:00 pm (I was recovering from a couple of very late nights), and slept until 5:00 am this morning.  When I checked my FitBit, it tracked me sleep from 8:00 pm until shortly after mid-night....and reported only 4 hours sleep.  As is typical for when this happens, neither my FitBit nor my iPhone was low on battery.  Plus (as is also the case every time this happens), I can see heart rate data continued to be reported during this missing time (from 12 midnight to 5:00 am). The fact that heart rate tracking is never disrupted makes me infer that the problem is NOT the way I am wearing the watch, nor the wifi connection, nor any other environmental issue.....and it is NOT because I am sleeping less than three hours (If I have one more rep tell me that is the issue, I just might scream) I have done ALL the troubleshooting steps suggested (restarting, reloading, reconnecting, etc.) and even though I explain that I have already done so, I follow the directions from the CHAT HELP to do it yet again...every time I call to report this problem.  I cannot get any of the reps to understand that my issue is not how to FIX the issue so that it will work the following night (as I have always been able to do so), it is WHY I should have to wonder every day whether or not the tracking will work that night and what is causing the interruption of my sleep tracking.  Surely, there is a system issue for this to keep happening?
There is a bug right now.  My active minutes isn't transfering over right currently and I was told they are working on a fix.  Might be the same issue.
I don't think so. Physically you sleep 6 hours, there are definite processes in your body, when you are awake for that 1 hour there are some other processes added. So I think you still lack 1 hour of sleep.
Often,  my dashboard says I have not recorded my sleep (though I did set it and unset it that morning. Yet, I can't put in the info as it says a the time is already recorded.  So,I decided to just wait until morning and put in the info, but I still get the message that sleep is already recorded for this time.  How can I take delete a record that I cannot see?
Where can I find out which of the 3 areas affected my "sleep score"?  I am sure that some nights it's lower due to duration, but other nights when the duration seems appropriate, I'd like to be able to see if it's the Quality or the Restoration that is lacking.  But I can't figure out where to view that?  Thanks.
Soo, I’ve been a Fitbit user since day one and now it looks like we have to pay for this feature. 😡 it was free! I just updated my app, says it’s a premium feature. It’s super disappointing to see that I spent a lot of money on a better tracker to have to pay more money on features that used to come with the device. Is anyone else in the same boat?
Hello everyone. @CompleteNewbie @Brujita @ssathya Thanks for taking a break from stepping to visit the Community. @CompleteNewbie Thanks for providing us with screen shots of your sleep logs. Your sleep efficiency is calculated depending on the time you were in bed and the time you actually slept. Like you mentioned, it shouldn't show as 100% if you were moving all around. I forwarded this issue to the engineering team for further investigation. Thanks for reporting it.
 
As @Brujita stated, if you have your sleep setting set to sensitive it could be a good idea changing it to normal. Please force sync after making any change in your Dashboard.

Moderator edit: subject for clarity
OK i have a fitbit flex and i wont let me go into sleep mode. i have witched videos on youtube and i have tried what they have told me to do tap on the bracelet rapidly for one or two seconds and it still wont go on so i dont know what to do now!!
I wear my device on my nondominant wrist during the day. At night, I switch it to my dominant wrist to give my other wrist a break. I leave it set to "nondominant" in the app and loosen the strap one notch at night because that seems more comfortable.  I get good, reliable sleep data doing this and I've done it for years, with every device I've had. I started out years ago, with an Alta HR. Now I'm using a Sense, so I've had a big range of devices and this routine has always worked well for me. I don't know if it would work for anyone else.

I have found that even on sensitive setting, it does not record when I am up walking around in the middle of the night!  I will have nights that I am restless, or need to let the dogs out, or go to the bathroom.  I will be up and walking around and check the time on my fitbit.  In the morning I check the log to see how I supposedly slept, and it will say restless, but not awake.  It is overestimating my sleep time.
@Drduggie I went to the doctor to see what he had to say. I told him about my situation, and also that it had gotten worse since about a month, month and half. I also told him I quit smoking around that time. Even though mentally that wasn't hard, he does say that it's possible that the physical is what's haunting my sleep. He's prescribed sleeping meds. Told me to take them for a month, and then go off them, see how it goes.  @WilsonFitbit A sleepmask is something you should talk about with a physician, not something you should buy on a whim, I think?

I took the liberty to move your post from "Get moving" to "Sleep better", since it’s about sleep. My first Fitbit was a One, and I remember the sleep tracking function was a bit cumbersome: you had to remember to put it on your wrist, start the sleep at some point and remember to stop it in the morning. Now I’ve got the Surge: it’s already on my wrist and it autodetects start and end of sleep (quite well IMO). I’ve found the feature useful. Not that I can do much about the number of times awaken and restless, but at least I try to sleep longer (at least 7 hours). I also like the (relatively new) feature where the mobile app reminds you it’s time for bed.

Hi everyone,  Is it possible to get a view of our sleep stages performance stats for any given whole month? I want to see if there is an improvement/difference of the different stages, not just the amount of overall sleep ours. How can we visualise this? Thanks
Great, thanks. In am so worried about losing it.
I also don't understand why they went to a score rather than the previous method.  The app should provide an enable/disable option so we can resort to the previous measure of hours slept vs. the goal.
Hi @rachelmulraneyy Here are some things that I have heard helps with sleep:- turn off cell phones, tvs and other blue-light sources at least one hour before bed- try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends - if possible, get out into bright light for 5-30 minutes as soon as you get out of bed in the morning - avoid caffeine in the evenings- try dimming the lights 2-3 hours before bedtime- do not eat big meals or heavy meals too late - increase bright light exposure during the day- white noise or running a fan
I've been wearing my versa overnight for the past 3years , since a week ago its stop tracking at 5.45 overnight , I'm still asleep and can quarante Im definitely not up at that time . so why as it stop
Hi, Daves_Not_Here:  I like this suggestion about paper vs ereader when trying to relax to fall asleep. It is a thought that had recently occurred to me, but the wrinkle of fiction vs nonfiction is a new idea that I will consider.
I’m having the same issue with my Versa 3.
I cannot speak to the normalcy of it, but I do the same thing.
_dt.  Bottom line, how does the report stack up to how you actually feel?  Try it in both sensitive and normal modes.  If normal says 97% and you feel like a zombie, go back to sensitive.  If sensitive says 29% and you feel like you had a great nights sleep, then vice versa.  I have issues with my cervical spine, RLS, Sleep Apnea, Reflux, and shoulders.  I don't sleep well.  Sensitive says most nights I'm between mid-30s to mid-50s.  This tracks with me always wanting not get up in the morning because I feel like c....!!.  If you sleep with a partner, you might want to try switching arms and letting the program know, just in case your partner is accidently brushing your device. Oh, BTW.  Your post says "First night sleep time".  Don't base anything on one reading.  Run your findings for a week or a month to see how it goes, then compare how you feel with what the devices is saying.

The highest I've managed to score is an 89, and the lowest I've scored was a 51. My average tends to rest around 87. I do have premium, so I can see the breakdown. As long as I hit my sleep goal (6 hours), my scores seems to stay above 85. The next important piece seems to be how much time is spent with my heart rate below my average resting heart rate for that day. After that seems to be how much time I spent awake. I'm unsure how to raise the third category because it's based on how much deep and REM sleep you get. I always seem to score 20-22 out of 25 on a normal night. I pretty much always hit the "benchmark" for the percentage of time spent in each category, but my deep and REM tend to be at the bottom end. My light sleep is practically always at the very top of its benchmark, so it may be that it values deep and REM sleep over light sleep. How much you toss and turn at night also seems to be a factor, but I don't see a significant difference caused by it. The app does talk about its breakdown, and what it says is pretty similar to what I've noticed. I think, to have a 'perfect' score, you have to score 0% on their restlessness, get a LOT of deep and REM sleep, hit your sleep goal, and wake up very very little. Possibly not at all. I wish I had my Fitbit on when I went into my coma in January. It lasted 27 hours, and I would've loved to see how they broke down my sleep score for that.
I think as we age we become more susceptible to insomnia. I remember my parents sitting at breakfast comparing how many hours each laid awake till they finally fell asleep, got up to start the day at the crack of dawn or took a sleeping pill. The sleeping pill always consisted of mad math skills because if you wait too long, your next day is ruined. I have fought insomnia for years. I finally have given up and just embrace it. I don't get out of bed, I don't turn anything on ( I don't have a TV in my bedroom and my phone is always downstairs at night). I just lie there and I let the thoughts come. I pet the dog. I go through my next day. Eventually my brain gets tired and I fall asleep for whatever is left of the night. I think those who fight the insomnia maybe make it worse.. giving in sometimes helps to put you to sleep faster.

Hi @KatieMidd ! Nice to see you on the Community! Thank you for your information. 
 
Your sleep record/tile will not appear on your app if you don't have a heart rate able tracker or watch paired to your account. 
 
The happens mostly when you remove the device of your account or you performed a factory reset, and didn't setup the device again. 
Or if you logged out of your Fitbit app and then logged in but with another email address. Small changes on the email address can create a new account . e.g your main account is musterman1@gmail.com and you only gave input musterman1@hotmail.com you created another account and therefore your Fitbit device is not on that account. 
 
To check the email address on the account on your app, please tap on your profile picture> account settings>change email address. Do not change the address here, just make sure that the one displayed is the one you created your main account. 
If it's not, log out of the app and then log in again with the right email address. 
Then tap on your profile picture and verify that your Fitbit device is paired to your account if not , please follow the steps in here: How do I set up my Fitbit device?
Hope this helps

Okay, so we get the results of the movement and heart rate assessed into Fitbits' algorithm on how we slept. But that's just a starting point for REALLY figuring it out, especially for those of with life-stealing insomnia.  I want to be able to annotate the sleep log with 1) a few different ratings and an overall score and 2) a more detailed description that we can use about our experience of the what we did the night before and how that night REALLY went for us and how we felt waking up. I want it stored historically. The stats don't tell the real picture. They are just a part of the puzzle to me. Like I can be peacefully meditating trying to get to sleep and but not be in a sleep stage. Consciousness is not really measured. We need our own assessments on top of the numbers.
Please remember that in sensitive it will show every little movement.On.The web interface, clicking the pencil will allow you to change the sleep mode, I found this interesting to compare.
Technically its no fitbit model is currently authorized to measure blood pressure.  The study of Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) for blood pressure measurement announced did so for a select group of Sense owners.  I wasn't selected and don't know if they left any of the code on customer's Sense watches or if they even let the customers know the results measured.Hopefully the results were good and the feature will rollout to some existing Fitbits.  Probably also need FDA approval.
I got the new sleep stages 2 nights ago and then last night it was back to the sleep pattern.  Does anyone know if there is something we have to change in settings to keep the sleep stages on?
Usually have an evening meal before 8pm, but agree earlier is better. Will try that and also meditation when waking up. Thanks for the tips 🙂
Great article, I also will start wearing my Fitbit to bed.
I feel if the percentages were adjusted to exclude time awake, they would be more accurate and informative. To explain, I really like the fact the amount of 'awake' time is displayed, giving the user a better reflection of the time spent sleeping, not just the time spent in bed. However, when it comes to calculating the percentage of your time spent in either REM, light sleep or deep sleep, I do not see why 'awake time' is part of this. For example, if I am in bed for 9 hours and I get 7 hours sleep (meaning I was awake for 2 hours), then I want to know the share of SLEEP time accounted for by each stage. In the current format, 1 hour of REM sleep in the example above would equate to 11.1% (1 hour as a percentage of 9 hours). But, what I really want to know is, how much time in REM is as a share of the hours I was actually sleeping. That would be 14% in this example (1 hour as a percentage of 7 hours). Including the two hours 'awake' is unnecessary for the distribution percentage, in my opinion. The longer the awake time is, the more misleading the proportion in each stage becomes. To summarize, I want to know the proportion of time spent in each sleep stage, but only in relation to the hours I was actually asleep.
Hi! I have been happily wearing my Charge 2 since May of this year. Seems like I am sleeping enough but consistently only getting like 1-1,5 hours of REM sleep and similar amount of deep sleep. According to the fitbit article on sleep stages I need more. I am wondering if this is unusual, if I should do something about this or if this could have anything to do with how my Charge 2 tracks me. Any ideas are welcome!
A person usually only remember dreams that occurred within minutes of waking up. I remember having one dream that I was talking to dad, it turns out I also had slept walk and was indeed talking to him.
I'm new to Fitbit. I've purchased a Fitbix Flex in an attempt to track my sleep and if I get on with it, I plan on upgrading to a model that features a heart rate monitor. The main reason for wanting a Fitbit is to get some sort of idea of my sleep. I've used the Fitbit for two nights now, and I seem to have some quite varied results on both the sensitive and normal settings. On the sensitive setting, I have had 22x and 24x restless periods, 4x and 6x awake, and slept for 3hr22min the first, and 3hr46min the second night.On the normal setting, I have had 16x restless the first night, 14x restless the second, 2x and 2x awake and slept for 8hr30min and 8hr52min. The sensitive setting seems to be too sensitive, and the normal, too normal, if that makes sense? When I wake in the morning I am stuffy and shattered, I know I have not slept for almost nine hours like the normal setting says. I also wear a mouth guard at night as I grind my teeth quite badly. I just would like to get an idea of what I'm doing at night, is 16x restless periods, even on the normal setting, normal? There is some quite wild variation between the two settings so I'm not sure what to think! Thank you!

Hey! I have the Alta hr and I purchased it for the main reason for tracking my sleep. The sleep stages worked twice before going back to what I've been seeing it's called the old way. I read up on other posts saying they've experienced the same troubles and the experts are telling them to add a log or begin sleep now but that isn't working for me. I've tried everything they've suggested to others and it's not working. My battery is charged, the band is not to loose and not to tight and I sleep the same way every night. I'm updated so that isn't the reason it's not working either. Can someone actually suggest something helpful for once? Not bullcrap.
I agree too, first thing I thought of when reading your post was possible sleep disorder. I hope you can get your dr to do a sleep study to see if you need a c-pap. I hope you will feel better soon. Let us know!
Hi @johnlsummey04  and @AnnaMccoy  It's interesting you both joined the forums yesterday and keep posting the same link. You two working together or something?

I have found that if I have exercised for a reasonable amount of time (for me that is at least 2.5 miles) sometime over the day, been pretty active for at least 25% of the day, I sleep better. On the days when I go to work, sit at my desk, skip my walks, skip a healthy lunch or eat junk, (or drink iced tea/coffee/caffeinated drink after 12 noon!) then I don't sleep. at all. If I'm lucky I'll get 4 hours those nights. I also try not to worry about tomorrow. Worry is like a rocking chair. It occupies your time, but gets you no-where. Avoid a big meal at night. Don't have chocolate at night.  Monitor things for a few weeks. Figure out if there are things that help you get a good nights sleep, and things that hinder it. Develop a bedtime routine and stick to it. Turn off computer/phone an hour or two before bed. Remove TV from bedroom. Drink some chamomile tea with a little honey after supper. Watch the sunset, do a little calming yoga (episode 76 yogadownload.com), read a bit, meditate, avoid dozing in front of TV on the couch or chair.  Take a leisurely walk after dinner, with someone you love. Avoid stress, arguments, and your to-do list after 8PM. Make sure your bedroom feels cozy and unclutter it if needed. Listen to your favorite relaxing music - think about what made you sleepy when you were a little younger and try it now. If you have tried everything, have kept a journal of sleep patterns, mood, food, etc. (fit bit dashboard is good for that!) and nothing seems to be working after a few weeks or a month, talk to your doctor. Also, how oftean are you  waking up? Is it the sleep, or the number of times you wake up that is the problem? You can monitor that in fitbit too. I found that to be an eye-opener so to speak, no pun intended. On a good night I wake up less than 8 times. On a bad night I might wake up 15-30 times. All that information can help you, and if needed, your doctor to determine how to help you.
@TinaFields I have two thoughts:1. Is it possible that you sleepwalk?2. I suffer from insomnia periodically and if I get up to go to the bathroom and then toss and turn for a while, the Fitbit thinks I'm awake for the day. Then when I get back to sleep, I have two sleep records for one night. Lukily, you can go in and edit the start/end time to make it all one sleep period, but it might be interesting to see how active you were during that 'missing' period in order to answer #1.
I have the Charge 4 and mine is doing the same and when I did the sync its no longer even listed, these are the only things I have now.
Hello @Hpierson, welcome to the community forums! @JohnnyRow, it's great to see you around and thanks for your input! 
 
Adding to what @JohnnyRow mentioned, if you go to the Fitbit App > tap on the "Sleep tile" > swipe to the left until you find "Hours in Sleep Stages", then tap on any of the blue graph displayed, you will be able to see 2 options "1 week and 1 month at the top of the screen". Tap on any of those options and you will be able to see your Sleep Stages Average for REM, light and deep. It can be either for 1 week or 1 month. 
 
Hope this helps!

Hmm, the only thing that jumps out is that large amount of wake time.You can also compare it to the Benchmarks for your age group to see if anything else is too high or low. It's somewhat of a mystery how Fitbit calculates the sleep score. I honestly can't say from the chart why the score would be that low. I tend to just go by how I feel more than the score. If the score starts annoying me I just look at https://www.fitbit.com/sleep so I don't see it.

Hello everybody! I had a similar problem. I couldn't sleep for a long time. What do you think about the help of medications in this case?
I want to encourage people to get checked for sleep apnea if you continue to wake up tired. And, if you are female, do you ever wake up with a headache? Men do not seem to get the headaches because they wake up with a snort more often in the night. (This is per my sleep apnea doc - not making it up 😉 If you have a partner, AND they fall asleep after you sometimes, ask them if they ever hear you sound like you are not getting air in. My boyfriend is who first noticed it in me. Sleep apnea can be caused just by your natural anatomical build. If you have a large tongue, your tongue can occlude your air passage when it relaxes in sleep. It used to be thought of as something only caused by carrying extra weight on your body - which can make the throat opening narrower. But now they realize anyone can have it.
Not everyone notices the buzz, but let's see if a silent alarm will vibrate for you. Read these directions for setting up a silent alarm to test the vibration. If you don't get a vibration after the alarm goes off, then you'll want to restart your device, using these directions. Please do the procedure at least three times to ensure it's working right.

Oh my God are you me?? I have literally been struggling so much with sleep in the past few years. I used to be able to sleep like a full eight hours in my early thirties. But there came a point in my life when I could literally not sleep more than four hours even if i tried. I just chalked it off to me getting old until my fiance suggested that I get blackout curtains (he hates it when I leave the bed in the middle of the night). Then I did get blackout curtains and it didn't make a ton of difference but it set off a kind of determination in me. I tried sleeping masks and these sleeping oil things that are supposed to help u sleep but just like you, to no luck. One thing that did help me amongst the many things I tried was melatonin pills. When I started taking them, I used to take them right before bed and I didn't feel any improvement in my sleep. But then my friend told me to take them 2-3 hours before bed and I started doing that. I got mine delivered from this place so you might want to see if the place where you got them from was reputable: https://www.vitaminexpress.org/uk/melatonin-supplements.Figuring out the dosage and timing is what helped me get a good 5-6 hours of sleep. I don't know if it is a placebo or if it's actually the melatonin lol. So you might wanna check if youre administering the drugs the right way. Sleep is a fickle thing. I hope that you can find a solution 🙂
You just solved my dilemma!!!  Thank you! Now, if I could just figure out after all this pounding if I have turned the sleep mode ON or if I have turned it OFF!!!
If you have sleep apnea like I me you stop breathing for a few seconds each night . This may effect the Spo2 reading.I can't say for sure since the watch can't give me a reading during the day.
By golly, finally found sleep average. Not easy to get to though. I'll keep working on it.
@donalduck.. hey there and yes they do. the reason in difference is the HR factor. your flex just knows you aren't moving. your HR knows you are at a resting HR for an extended period of time. I would trust the data of your C3 over the flex.

Sleep function useless does not sync or will turn off and back on during the night totally useless.
@InsomniacYes Yes he does do the devices brand new. But for the Sense, he actually did re-review it's monitoring and he released videos in 2021 and compared them to 2020. That is interesting that changing the end time to longer made some adjustments to the cycles prior. Personally my Sense was originally purchased in August 2020 but I've been using it since the end of December 2021. In that 2.5 months or so of use, I haven't noticed any start or end time issues, yet.

I'm having the same issue as of this morning. Heart rate clearly tracked all night, and yet I only see basic sleep data - the usual link for "Why am I only seeing basic sleep data?" is not there, oddly, and I also didn't get a sleep score.
@Jenjen118 wrote:I was curious what other peoples "minutes to fall asleep" is?Mine is ALWAYS zero, and I was wondering if that could really be correct? I also have a 97%-%100% sleep efficiency most nights. Is this normal? Or am I blessed in the sleep realm? Jen@Jenjen118 I have finally decided to post this about the time to fall asleep. I found by sheer accident that when you edit the start time of a sleep record it corrects the 0 minutes falling asleep problem. This is with a Charge HR...... Why was I editing ?. Because if you have multiple sleep records only first record gets exported. I accidentally altered a start time on a sleep record by one minute and updated and it gave me the Time to fall asleep. I then edited that record again and made it the correct time and the Fall asleep time was still there. Here is an example from last night.. Three sleep records and all edited the same way and then the result. I have accidentally truncated the last record off the Before image. But I was wearing the Surge for another test and it's sleep records have exactly the same issue..but one extra sleep record and the Charge was on the LH wrist and the Surge the RH wrist. But importantly I need to edit the records if I want my "Fall asleep time" Before -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  After -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Surge before..............................................  Surge After .....................................................

Are there any standards for sleep efficiency by age groups?  I assume young people are more sleep efficient than older people but by how much?If you are 70% sleep efficient at 65 years is that relatively normal for the population?
My fitbit has given me a sleep efficiency of 99 percent, and I always awaken totally drained, but then again I have low cortisol levels and a mild sleep apnea. That is probably why I feel tired all the time.
Hi,I am always syncing in the morning before looking ... its not the case ... I was hoping to get some official response from Fitbit reps ... aren't thet suppose to be here? Fitbit claims to be the best sleeping tracking device ...can't they say what are the possible reasons it misses some sleeping time in the beginning or in the middle of the night?how can I check it? if there are relevant posts I missed please let me know ... I was searching for that ... a bit disappointed from the lack of response from official reps ... thanks again,Shay
Why provide medical information if it is not intended to be useful?
What is your caffeine consumption like?  Not only tea and coffee, but cola's etc too?  Maybe try drinking just plain water after lunch every day to see if that helps you to sleep better or if, like my hubby, you *have* to drink tea and coffee 'cos it's who you are, try decaf tea and coffee?  Just to see if it works for you as well as it does for my hubby?  If you drink hot drinks in the evening, maybe try hot/drinking chocolate or warm milk or even thick, creamy soup?  Experiment and see what works for you  🙂 What do you do when you wake up at 11pm and 1am?  Do you just lay in bed tossing and turning and getting frustrated or do you do something during those times?  When you wake up at 1am, maybe try making yourself a warm drink to see if that helps?

Hi there @AmandaGeorge, thanks for stopping by.
 
Totally agree with @WavyDavey. The average person goes through five sleep cycles per night. Each one of those cycles is approximately 90 minutes long. Five cycles of 90 minutes each translates to 450 minutes in total which works out to be about 7.5 hours. It's not just the hours of sleep that matter, but also which sleep cycle you wake up from.
 
There's stage one, two, three, four, and REM. Stages one and two are the easiest to wake up from, REM is slightly more difficult, and then stages three and four are the hardest.
 
When you sleep an extra hour or two more than you normally do, chances are you're going to wake up from the REM cycle, or cycles three or four, which means you're going to feel groggier.
 
This also explains why taking a short power nap is more effective than taking a longer nap. Longer naps will force you to wake from one of the later sleep cycles, leaving you feeling more tired than rested. When I take naps, I usually take them for just a short 25 minutes.
 
So even if you feel tired enough to sleep forever, stick with the number of hours you need instead. 😊

Some months ago I promised to report on my experience with my CPAP and tracking my deep sleep with Fitbit. Sadly, the CPAP did NOT improve my deep sleep on a long-term basis; I had a few rebound nights of 14%+ (per my Fitbit) but after that my deep sleep dropped down to the usual 5%-8%.  I continued to use my CPAP but am switching to an oral appliance since my apnea is so low. I’ve now tracked and experimented for about six months with various techniques (raised bed, vigorous exercise, warm baths, ongoing CPAP use, etc.) I had another sleep study, and again the Fitbit was on the mark for REM and light sleep but off the mark for deep sleep (as were my Apple watch apps). I don’t think this is so much a Fitbit-specific problem, it’s just that movement+heart rate+algorithm do not equal reasonable accuracy for deep sleep. Still, I found the Fitbit to be useful for purposes of tracking consistency – if I exercised a lot, or took a warm bath, etc. then how did my deep sleep respond per the Fitbit? The Fitbit moderators might not be happy with me providing this information, but people might want to know that there is now a nearly gold-standard device on the market that does accurately capture deep sleep. I was loaned a Dreem headband (designed by a French company called Rythm) and believe it or not I was able to figure out how to use it with a sleep study.   The headband was accurate in reporting my deep sleep. This accuracy is consistent with a study published in a well-regarded, peer-reviewed journal that reported on the accuracy of the Dreem in tracking deep sleep https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5853451/ (the study reported on other features as well, including enhancing slow-wave/delta sleep through the use of pink noise delivered at the moment the wearer goes into deep sleep.) There are two of these headbands on the market (the other is a Philips product called SmartSleep) and they are simply a different technology than the wrist wearables in that they are EEG-based with sensors on the forehead.   It is a far more sophisticated technology than wrist wearables, and the price shows – the Dreem is $500 (yet it sold out in the U.S. shortly after it went on the market.) The Philips headband is $400. I haven’t tried that one. I don’t intend to purchase either headband right now, although the enhancement of slow waves during deep sleep might be of interest to me as that technology advances. For now, after using the Dreem for a bit I feel like I have a good handle on the amount of deep sleep I typically get. And although Fitbit doesn’t accurately capture my deep sleep, I will still use it for purposes of tracking changes to my deep sleep on the theory that the Fitbit is consistent in showing day-by-day changes, even though the actual amount might not be correct. In my case, Fitbit has been correct in its REM, light sleep, and time that I go to sleep and wake up.
You can go into any log of the sleep tracked and edit those. For example on the phone go into the sleep tile. There click on the day you want to edit. At the top right corner should be three dots next to eachother. Click on that and you can edit or delete any log here. In your case it might also be helpful to tell the app when you are going to sleep and when you are awake again. Again in the app, but this time click the + sign at the bottom. Select log sleep and click Begin Sleep Now. Similar when waking up.

I am averaging only about 1 hour of deep sleep a night and this concerns me. I would like to know an average for about 7 and a half hours sleep.
@Sleeper_Awakens  A post from @davidh1 will fix it. He said "Go to the log / sleep area, click on EDIT, (like you were going to adjust the start/end time) and without changing anything click on "update".  It will re-calculate the sleep efficiency." It does work. I used it to fix my own sleep log for the past few days. Welcome to the forums.

Hi wavydavey.. Thanks for replying... i thnk im becoming obsessed.. everymorning im checking my sleep patterns along with my resting heart rate!!!!I'll get the hang of this eventually... thanks again
Wonder what's going on... hopefully they'll figure it all out
noted in several (many) other posts under many headings, Sleep stages were visible, then disappeared last week. I still don't have them back. Anything you can tell us about what's happening? I have a fitbit blaze for over two months now it seems I get the new graph etc for a few days then it disappears. Not had it back now for over four days
It's completely normal to not remember waking up or moving during the night cause it's usually for a brief period.I'm not sure what is normal in terms of how many times people wake up/move, but I've had my Flex for a week now and I average about 14 red spikes a night using the normal setting and I usually remember waking up two or three times a night. I believe it varies greatly from person to person...I think the more important thing is how you feel upon waking up in the morning. If you feel well rested, that is the most important thing in my opinion.
@EdsonFitbit, the most I have slept is for 11 hours, actually my alarm didn't work that day. I usually sleep for 7 hours, but it was nice to rest for a little more haha.

A friend recommended an Ooler - its basically AC for your bed, goes right ontop of the mattress. My wife gets hot in the night despite the AC, we live in a hot place - so i gave it a try. She has her side colder than mine. Results so far - i sleep the same length of time, but my light sleep goes down and my REM and deep go way up. Last night my Deep was 21% vs my 30 day average of 11% and my REM was 23% vs my av of 15%. I certainly feel more refreshed, strangely my sleep score doesn't seem to change much from before. I think some of it is my wife not being restless in the night means i can sleep better too. Only downside is its expensive.
I've given up trying to get information on what exactly Fitbit is measuring. Switching to normal gives me results that correspond more with how I experience the night, but then - why use fitbit at all? At this point it's just a handy log of when I went to bed and got up. But you may have a clue in mentioning animals on the bed. I don't have animals and switching to normal worked; while you have animals and switching to normal doesn't work. Still leaves the question of what it's measuring. Animals shifting? Someone snoring? Someone breathing? Telepathic reception of all dreams going on in the bed?In the meantime, grinding my manual coffee grinder (circular motion with arm) gives me steps so maybe that's what FB is: something that saves us from carrying pencil and paper around.In normal, pre-FB life, I can tell if I'm getting adequate sleep (what sleep deficit has accumulated) by how long weekend naps are and how necessary a nap feels when I'm home and it's a real possibility.
Journaling is good therapy whenever you are bothered by something. I love a good moleskine journal and a jet stream ink pen! I prefer old-fashion pen/paper instead of a keyboard.

Have you tried restarting your fitbits?  https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1186
Looked at HR from the sleep the night before and noticed it was insanely higher than normel. Normal sleeping is 60ish. For around 5 hours, it was around 140 - 160. Not sure if it was a glitch or I'm fixing to stroke out?
My Fitbit underestimates my deep sleep by a lot compared to clinical sleep study.It also mistakes quiet lying in bed for light sleep.What good is it then for?
Hi Trainer Thank you for your reply - it is nice to know. Guess I will have to stop using the sleep feature until they fix it as I have discovered with it being on sensitive the battery is only lasting two days. Thanks again
Do you have any suggestions to sleep better?Since the fourth lockdown, I always stay up late, the mood is down and stressful...

Hi @sammymack21, I would have to ask you-- what do you mean when you say "accurate"? Really, the only thing we can say is accurate is a full-blown sleep study. Are you wanting to know in comparison to that, or what is your standard for accuracy? I can't read from your post how much deep sleep you are getting. 2-5 what?

Don't know that there is any kind of average, @Classy16, since so many things affect how restless one is when sleeping.  I just looked over the past week, and mine ranged from a low of 3x to 16x during the week.
Hi Sebastien, Many thanks for your comment. Yes, you are correct, everyone does have different lengths of time to get to REM. But after much research on the subject it would seem that the average time to get there is 90 minutes. It certainly seems to be so for me as well. I did post in Feature Requests as well. Best regards Chris
I often wake in the night and get up to make a cup of tea or walk around the house - say 20 minutes in total.   Sometimes the initial sleep (less than 3 hours) isn't recorded but at other times it is - as continuous sleep through the night. What determines how 20 minutes of waking time is recorded - ie as continuous sleep or not continuous?
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
I've never had mine do that. Maybe I have a bony wrist and it wont slide. I guess you could put some tape over it to hold it like elastoplast, or try a crepe bandage over it. Just a thought.

Great post. A while back, my daughter came in at 3am. She works until 10pm and I usually wake up at 11:00 when she gets home. When I asked where she was until 3am, she responded, 'it was more like midnight dad.' Out comes the sleep cycle. At which she responded, 'nerd, who keeps track of that stuff.'
I agree.  It's actually had the opposite effect of what they intended with me in that I am now looking at other watches as mine will need replaced soon; their new and improved features just get in the way of me accessing the features I bought the device for in the first place.  Extremely irritated.
Here is the link to learn more about sleep tracking. Everyone is different in how many hours it seems they are sleeping. Here is a thread where we were discussing it.

I don't what others' graphs look like. I'm on CPAP and it seems to be consistent when my wife wakes me up -- to tell me that I need to put the mask back on because I'm snoring -- and high oxygen variation.
I have been tracking my sleeping patterns and would like to email them to my doctor. How can I do this from my phone?
I used another iPhone app a while back that was sound based instead of movement. I ended up deleting it because it was a little creepy.   Other than that, this is the only sleep tracking device I've used.

@christyvido no Fitbit can be suitable for you as one of your requests is to have Respiratory rate all day and Fitbit provides such metric only during sleep.
I'm in normal. I've just seen people with 1-5x restlessness so I was a bit worried. I wear it the same as I always do during the day.

I'm 76 and I've been an early waker since I was a teen. I naturally woke at about 5am and never had to use an alarm. I used those few hours before my wife woke to walk,read,  get some extra work done both for my job and around the house, and occasionally I would help someone rise early so I could drive them to the airport. But now that I'm in my 70's I find that I'm waking a little later, sometimes as late as 6:30. I learned to go with the flow decades ago and I"m retired now so I simply get up when I wake up. I love the morning quiet and all the time I have to myself. I still get a lot done.
I tried to force my fitbit to track my sleep does any have the same problems
I have worn the Force since January 7th and the sleep it records for me is strange. For the first few weeks I had it set for normal.  I reset it for sensitive to have a more accuarate report yet I still do not see the match of asleep hours with colors. The blue stripe shows at least two to 3 straight asleep hours then several restless stripes and several more blue asleep blocks of time with a few awake minute.  For example my Force reports I had only 38 minutes asleep with 7 minutes awake, and 306 minutes restless, another night 1hour and 40 minutes asleep 219 restless, and once 7 hours and 41 minutes asleep.  I know I am a super poor sleeper yet the tracking is seemingly way off.The blue bands show more asleep hours than it reports.  What am I doing wrong that I cannot get an accurate sleep count?
The best way to improve sleep is to make your bedroom completely dark, blackout shades, no electronic devices with LED lights remove your tv from the bedroom. Supplements that work are magnesium, melatonin, valerian root and kava kava.
What study said that it's 'scary' to miss 30 mins of recommended sleep?

My sleep score for 11/12/21 was 79, which for me is very good, so I won't complain. On 11/13 it was 78, so not much difference.  I had trouble falling asleep, but once I did, I slept well.  I got up at my usual 6:20 am this morning.11/14/21 sleep score 76.  I was not tired last night, so I sat up and read until just after midnight.  Slept well, though.11/15 sleep score 84, really good for me.11/16  sleep score 82.  I feel as if I slept well.
Look at the latest Pebbles. They can review activity, be a Smart Watch, and have apps for a Smart Alarm... about $200 though.
Sheri, Some people switch to the dominant wrist at night just to give their skin a break, and others never change. It really doesn't matter what wrist you use, as long as you are consistent. Sleep readings are not exact, but if you compare readings from the same wrist over time, you'll see meaningful patterns. Have you ever watched a dog move its paws while sleeping? Apparently you are doing some of that 😉 For this type of question, you might have gotten a quicker answer if you'd posted to the Help Forums. You can also type keywords in the Help Forum search box, and you'll get back lots of interesting reading. Welcome to the FitBit community! If I've answered your question, please mark my post as a solution.Best wishes,Louise

I, too have trouble sleeping. I was actually diagnosed with sleep apnea which is rare for someone like me (female, early 30s, average weight) but I assume you've ruled that out. You've probably also been told all the typical stuff: don't drink caffeine, don't have a TV in your room, don't sleep with pets but there are two things that helped me immensely: ear plugs and Benadryl. I've weened myself off the Benadryl and only take it when I travel and only sometimes. Hope this helps.
@shewolf792 yes, the sleep animal is a Premium feature. Also, it is only available with certain Fitbit models.

Hello @N4t47i3, welcome to the community forums! 
 
If you refer to the Sleep score, you must receive sleep stages to see a Sleep Score. Note that there are factors that could prevent receiving sleep stages, so please consider the following: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
For SpO2, this is only available for Fitbit Versa 3 and Sense. For details, please check: 
How do I track blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) with my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps!

@craig1984 Sleep apnea may show up in the watch data as periods of high "Estimated Oxygen Variation".  Some apnea events may cause you to wake up. How do you know your multiple wakeup problem is not caused by sleep apnea. Also, in my case, my fitbit reports that my breathing rate is two breaths per minute higher when using  CPAP than when I'm not using CPAP. Without using CPAP, the increased number of apnea events (periods of not breathing) are slowing down my average breath rate.
HiIf the tracker is on you then it is only tracking your movement... This would even be you changing sleep position I.e turning over...its a movement that would be picked up and reported as restless
I've tried a chillpad, but wasn't happy with the results. After about 15 minutes, the coolness wore off. Cooling the entire bedroom is what's worked for me.

@Cheryl06 hmm, that does sound pretty low. Did you recently change your settings from Sensitive to Normal? If so, this could be bringing down your average. Please also ensure that your trackers firmware is up to date. You might also try a restart, if you haven't already. Restart instructions are here!
 
@rgravesx2 thanks for reaching out to our Community! On your Fitbit app, you should be able to see the battery life of your tracker. I've included a screenshot so that you can reference where the battery indicator is located. If you look in the top left corner of your app, you'll see that there's a little icon of whichever tracker is paired, with a battery symbol next to it. In my case, the battery is low so the battery turned red. If you have the old iOS dashboard or an Android device, this will look a bit different. Let me know which type of phone you have so that I can be more specific! 🙂

Unfortunately, nothing has worked. Suddenly my watch has become so dim that I can no longer see the clock or the settings. So I think Fitbit is going out of business and they are slowly killing off the watches...? (or trying to force everyone to buy a replacement which I am definitely not doing now)  Apple watches look nice.
Thanks Julia_G for your support and time!  I am not a sleep expert but I also feel that the sleep score is not so much accurate. Please see my comments below 1) When I sleep 6hr and 58 min I get an equal or lower score than when I sleep less than 5 hours. However, when I sleep less than 5 hours, I lack energy the next day.  2) When I sleep less than 5 hours I take a greater score than when I sleep 6hr and 3 min (even though I hit the benchmark).  The data is below:   Sleep ScoreDuraion   784h 54 min           Min%  Awake46 min13%  REM59 min17%  Light2hr 42min47%  Deep1hr 13min21%          786hr 58 min      Min%  Awake1hr 27min17%  REM44 min   Light4hr 9 min49%  Deep2hr 5 min24%          776hr 3 min      Min%  Awake39 min9%  REM1hr 12 min17%  Light3hr 45 min55%  Deep1hr 6min16%814hr 37 min      Min%  Awake28min9%  REM1hr 8min22%  Light2hr 33min50%  Deep56 min18% Enjoy your day 🙂
Yes, there are so many things that help us all, individually.It's nice to connect with others that know what it is like.What is so cool about Fitbit is that you can actually SHOW someone, like your husband, or your doctor, exactly what is going on.I think it is a wonderful tool!Not to mention the health aspect. Anyone who has RLS suffers somewhat from depression. Exercise sure helps.Thanks for reading!I only want to reach out in the most POSITIVE way. No pity party here!My thought was to connect and share remedies!Keep them coming!
Can’t get my sleep stages any more .!
ErickFitbit   The charts are similiar but the Desktop chart looks more like a real chart with variable data points (even though the points are a bit higher).  The IOS chart looks strange. The reason I even mentioned it was on 3/26 when sleep stages first arrived, I noticed my RHR increased from a range of 48 to 53 into this flatline 51-52 for the next 2 weeks.    The latest update (2 days ago)  caused it to bump up to 53-55 again.  The last 2 bars are the last 2 days after the new update.   It seemed to me that something occurred with the RHR calc exactly when the new Sleep stages were added and then again with the new update.  Is RHR being calculated differently? Hope this was helpful. David
Updated iOS app on 3/19/20.  Suddenly today no sleep data is downloading even after several attempts to sync tracker. Instead, a banner ad for Premium shows up.  I know that Premium is for the deeper sleep analysis and details, but basic sleep data and score should remain free. Please advise.
The oxygen level depends upon your overall health and age, so they decided to present only variation data. Sleep apnea is usually determined by variation, rather than absolute readings. Having used a continuous O2 monitor along with my Sense, I find that the Fitbit device has a low data sampling rate. The Sense has clock faces which show the upper and lower limits of the sleep SpO2 it records. I'm not familiar with other devices.
Hi @anotheruser12 - As far as I know, you can only see that in the Fitbit app on your phone.

Hello sleepyheads,  I have been learning about weighted blankets, mainly by talking with friends and seeing what's on youtube.  Amongst other things, these heavy blankets are apparently good for improving sleep. I wonder if anyone on this forum can share your experience.  Do you have one? Did it help improve your sleep quality or quantity?  Thank you, ERic
It is possible you could have accidentally bumped it out of sleep mode while you were sleeping or getting up to use the bathroom. I have noticed my Flex will go into sleep mode if I'm pushing a shopping cart around the store (because of the vibration, I think). Fortunately, I feel it buzz when that happens so I can fix it right away. I don't know how different a Charge is from the Flex, but I'm hoping it's a simple explanation. If not, I have found Fitbit customer service to be excellent! Have fun. 🙂
Same issue with my versa. It's my first Fitbit,  but I see  videos on youtube that allow users of past models to change the sleep tracking sensitivity of the devices via the app from sensitive to normal. The pathway show for accessing this menu does not appear to be the same for Versa owners, which leads one to believe it isn't a feature on this new device. Is this true for the Fitbit Vesa, or is this feature just hidden away somewhere?
I review an excellent rule of thumb a few days ago concerning the correct dosage for taking Waklert  : "if you're still not getting to sleep quicking or not staying asleep, you're taking too little; if you're getting extremely strange dreams, you're taking excessive." It's been benefiting me: 100 mg was insufficient; 125 mg was too much, and 150 mg seems to be working perfectly Anybody else wish to share their experiences with Waklert ?
 
Moderator Edit: Formatting
however I do get full details I see REM, Light, Deep, %hr below resting, etc. Also with not using it then if I get up a few times at night which I do wont it sense I'm awake and stop my sleep? How does it know when I'm truly awake?
The area that I have concern is the time awake at night.  Getting 14-17% deep sleep, REM and light are close to recommended averages but just can't seem to lower the time awake.  It equates to between 1 hour and 1 -1/2.  I don't feel unrested but would like to make the awake time more productive.
@Kirsten1983: Glad you're going to discuss this with your doctor. Yoursleep pattern may be normal for you but better to get it checked out bydoctor. You're right about unmedicated depression being hell --- worse,maybe, than with medication. Best wishes for good outcome. GoldaT.
I am a counselor at a middle school and have been trying to help a student who is deaf (has cochlear implants) figure out a way to increase independence, including being able to wake himself up in the morning.  Vibrating alarm clocks and the cell phone vibration do not do it for him.  I let him try my Fitbit Charge and set the alarm and he loved it!  He definitely thinks it will help wake him up.  Unfortunately I do not have the $ to buy one for him, nor do the parents at this time.  I would love if FItbit would be willing to donate a Charge to a most appreciative 7th grade boy?  We would spread the word to those we/he works with at the American School for the Deaf and I think it would be great for publicity.  What do you think, Fitbit? Thanks!

I am working towards a better night's sleep. The same method does not work for me every time, so I'm sharing some of the best methods that work for me. I change them up to fit my needs that day as my schedule does not allow a regular sleep schedule. When I've had a really busy day, I need to quite my mind. I turn everything off in my bedroom and lay in the dark. I focus on the quiet. As thoughts jump into my mind, I wisk them away with images of beaches, mountains, etc... When that does not work, I will CD's (yes, they still exist), with soothing sounds of nature or I set my TV to the music channels and choose a mellow channel and turn it to an low but audible level. Aromatherapy also helps me relax - filling my bedroom with the smell of lavendar or vanilla helps me relax. I also use an alarm that starts with nature sounds gently to awaken me from my slumber. It is better than be jarred awake by a loud alarm.
Sorry! I seem to have sent message twice.
When I reported to my doctor that I had been given a Fitbit for Christmas and was finding it very motivating in terms of sleep and activity reports, he asked me if I had gotten any sleep apnea notifications since wearing it. I haven't. And my sleep looks pretty good, showing I get between 7 and 8 and a half hours a night, with restlessness in the time leading up to getting up at pee and going back to bed from getting up. My question is, IS there a sleep apnea notification if a wearer were to have a bigger problem than restlessness during their sleep?
@Dominique I agree, I also like the sleep (restoration) HR graph. Its seems for me though that "normal" is a HR that is 50-80% over resting and on the odd (rare) occasion it may be around 60-75% below. I'm currently trying to work out how (if anything) I can do to change this so that my HR is below resting for the most part, so far I'm trying to cut out caffeine after midday.

Bravo! It's absurd. And now I have to pay to know my heart rate changes during sleep?!?!?! I was always planning to upgrade into a newer fitbit. I may seriously reconsider that now. Why bother paying 200$ when they was to coerce another 80 a year out of me by dangling basic data it collects in front of me. Screw that!
I deleted my app and reinstalled and now it's working fine 🙂
Flyingpeng, I do take magnesium before bed time, but I still have problem waking up at night. If it's not 3 am, then it's 4am and stay awake for at least an hour!!  The next morning I feel like a zombie. It's worst when Full Moon period .............!Friends advised me to take sleeping pills, even Drs gave some, but they make me more alert than sleepy! Now, I just have to live with it !
Thank you!  I just reset the tracker.  I'm assuming it won't restore data from the past 3 nights so I'll have to wait until tomorrow morning to see if it works.
Is it possible the machine is hindering your ability to find comfortable sleeping positions, for example? I some times put on a headset when I go to sleep, to get some relaxing music. After I've fallen asleep, I wake up as soon as my body tries to change position.
I bought a new Blaze last week.  One of the main reasons I bought it was for the detailed sleep information.  For the first 4 nights I had a full breakdown of REM, light and deep sleep which was fascinating but then for the last 3 nights all I got was something about being restless or awake.  Where has all that previous information gone?  Is that it now - have I spent a lot of money on something that doesn't deliver the goods it promised?
How can you tell when you are in REM sleep, vs deep sleep?   What am I aiming for?

Found this on the Fitbit website. "Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven't moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you're asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)"
If you are worried, see a doctor. @CaptainProton, what are the percentages of each stage in your chart?

This feature now seems to be working. It takes a while to calculate and update the app though. I'm not sure if this feature also requires the Spo2 watch face.
Has the sleep score been removed from the app? Have to purchase Premium now?
Sleep apnea?
I can't  seem to find the benchmarks for sleep. I used that all the time. Will it be back?
It should have saved automatically.  Can you give us more details about what you did and what happened?
I start the timeer when I go to bed and stop it when I wake but none of my sleep is being logged in the dashboard or on the Premium section.  What is wrong?
I felt like I slept worse with the one wrist band. It is too bulky and made my wrist hot!
I have trouble with sleep, so I watch my sleep charts carefully. Within the last 10 days, my Versa 2 has stopped showing any charts for sleep. It only shows I slept X hours, awake X minutes, restless X minutes. I have been trying to see if the Versa 2 needs an update and, if so, how to to it. I have firmware version 35.70.8.0. I don’t know what is current for 9 June 2020 or how to update it tho. I updated the app a couple days ago, hoping it would bring back the graphs with no success.
@JDiesel24it's nice to know I'm not alone.. LOL
Because it's actually video, not just audio. So if you turn the screen off it stops. And just as annoying, if you let it run to the end, it's doesn't turn the screen off after it's finished. So you'd have to stay awake to turn off the screen, or it will stay on all night disturbing your sleep. 🙄 So the sleep meditations are basically useless.
Thank you. I will try reinstalling but I hate the rigamarole. I have abadly twisted ankle and can't walk or exercise and all the fitbit has totrack is my sleep.Thanks anyway.Dorothy*“Once upon a time, when women were birds, there was the simpleunderstanding that to sing at dawn and to sing at dusk was to heal theworld through joy.

And like you said most google inquires lead back here and to the several other similar questions that have all been left unanswered. I mean don't get me wrong, I love my fitbit, however, it would be far more professional if they monitored these forums to be sure that their costumers were happy with the response and not left wondering and frustrated.
Hi Heather, It is quite worrying and think more research into fitbit and  dreaming needs to be done. I know plenty of people who have fitbits and don't have the dreams so it seems it is only a few of us affected this way. Sent from my Samsung Galaxy smartphone.
Today, 23 March 2021, my SpO2 doesn't load on my Versa 2 watch. It says: Sleep to update. But I did!I've got a premium subscription.But all my data everywhere is complete, at every device. My online dashboard is filled with last night's sleep pattern. My app in my mobile phone showsthe graphic of the estimated oxygen saturation of last night. There's nothing missing anywhere. Why doesn't show my Versa 2 not the Oxygen percentage of today? And is there any place where I can see these percentages every day, for I want to see my history in this (and they are very important to me).
Agree!
I knew I had sleep problems but didnt realize how bad it was.  Just want to know if anyones record is similar or worse than mine.
Hi, @gigglebytelinda... Just to clarify, have you switched off 'Quick View'? I wasn't sure if that's what you meant by 'screen wake' or not?

Roger that. I go by the same rule. Question is, how much net sleep should I be getting? whats the benchmark?
I switched mine to normal and it's fine now It all shows 93% to 98% now and looks more realistic to me
Thanks for sharing @dlandry!  😀

Based on your message it seems you are manually entering your sleep times. Is that correct ? When in manual mode, the Alta HR does not record the sleep stages. To record sleep stages, you need to be in automatic: simply do nothing, just go to sleep. The Alta HR uses a combination of movement and heart rate to know you are asleep. The next morning some minutes after wake up you will see your sleep stages. It is fairly accurate in getting bed times and getting up times automatically. See here: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314#howdoesmy
That is a shame; sounds like you were done a disservice. I am old enough to remember when people laughed at "health food nuts" for suggesting that diet was a serious determinant of health. And at the idea that smoking was bad for your health. And at the crazy ideas of "natural childbirth" and breast feeding as being somehow superior. It often happens that medical science co-opts useful practices developed outside medical settings, then years later people forget that it was not the field of medicine where those practices were pioneered and developed, but elsewhere and often greeted with scorn by physicians. I would not be surprised to see the use of fitness trackers end up being a similar story, due to their usefulness.
Thanks Carol,I have had the Versa 2 fairly snug on my wrist.I will loosen it and see if that makes a difference.
I have found as I lower my RHR my score in the Premium Restoration plummets resulting in a lower sleepy score.  Even though it's only 25% of the total sleep score I lost 10 points out of 25 the other night.  That's because my sleeping average HR is nearly the same as my RHR. My average sleeping HR was 54 and my RHR was 55.. and 53% of my HR was below the line.. Another example I only lost 5 points. My average sleeping HR was 55 and my RHR was 58 and 80% was under my RHR line.. I have a slow HR normally and passed by the specialists...

Me too... I've always been aware that I am a fairly 'light' sleeper and sadly my fitbit has confirmed it - I get less than half the amount of deep sleep in the benchmark, which is, I think, why I always feel tired even though I sleep about seven and a half hours a night. I know it also doesn't help that I live in a noisy city and I have done all of the usual recommendations (warm bath, cool bedroom, chamomile tea, no alcohol, regular times, no evening screen time, turn off wifi, relaxation beforehand etc), to no avail. Short of moving somewhere that is absolutely silent at night (not gonna happen!), I'd love to hear any bright ideas!
i have a lot of problems with the sleep tracking. If you bump it to hard doing something it will put it in sleep mode. I have noticed that if that happens, if I had logged my sleep, it disappears.
Somewhere in the Fitbit sleep help section, I was thinking perhaps right on the sleep display in the app if you scroll down, it says it is common to have several short wake periods during the night that you might not even remember.  From my experience, I would say more that your girlfriend's is more unusual, in the good sense.

Welcome to the Community forums @Oliver88, I think medication is part of the treatment for some people, but it's rarely the only thing required to get out of a state of depression, this is what most of the people suffering from depression agree on. It can be a long process to feel better, but there are definitely a number of factors to take into account.

Same problem here.  Four days wearing the Sense and I am missing BR and HRV.  Other stats work.
I spend between 9-10 hours in bed for net sleep of 8-9 hours. Yes, it takes some sacrifice, but it's not that hard to reduce my TV or Internet use by an hour each night. You have to ask yourself how important your sleep and it's related health aspects are to you.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
not sure to be honest.
Normally it does, at least for me it does. Though some people, when falling asleep again fall into a deep sleep fairly easily again, giving a lot of restoration. Just waking up at night doesn't mean you'll sleep poorly, also the type of sleep you're getting in and how restorative the sleep was count for a lot.
I have this same problem.  It used to record this on the watch, but for the past month at least, it hasn't.  Can someone out there advise us what can be done about this please?
I have a fitbit zip that's without the sleep mode tracker. Soon I be getting a new fitbit

Hi there, I have a similar problem. In my case I also have mild apnea, but I’m not able to have any deep sleep and I am awake most of the night. I only catch about an hour of light sleep each night.
About to sleep now...with my new Charge HR! Hoping it syncs correctly. Can't wait to read the data in the morning.

I am having this exact same issue. I have to manually log the times when I am a sleep and awake. My GF purchased the same Surge Fitbit on the same day; although she uses IS and I use Android - hers works and mine does not. Is there any reason why this may be the case?
Basically I upgraded my phone and downloaded the Fitbit app on my new phone, but since getting it the sensitivity for my sleep is high...how can I change this???
I downloaded the clock face to record the Sp02 but everyday it says “couldn’t read Sp02”. Can someone explain why?
From what I see (Fitbit can prove me wrong)The sleep tracker is there but you can’t select to see it in the app unless you pay for the premium service, at one time all the stats where visible but they are slowly moving to a subscription modelAnd they doafter the last update the Fitbit had disconnected from my phone and iPad when reconnecting the option to join premium and get your sleep analysis was the main display for some reason when the Fitbit was not connected the sleep tracker disappeared ? But everything else was visible Apologies to allSent from my iPad
Sometimes I edit the start of my sleep time so I can see how napping effects my sleep during the night, and when I did that last night, I realized it actually changed the data reported in the middle of the night, which is wrong.When I look at how I slept during the night from 10:12 - 5:26, I see this: Notice how little REM sleep I had in the middle of the night.  Now when I look at the whole night to see how much I dozed off earlier in the night starting at 7:12, I see this: Notice how there is now significantly more REM sleep in the middle of the night.  One of these must be wrong, right?  Why is it that when I change my start time to earlier from 10 pm to 7 pm, do I see more REM sleep between 11-4?
Completely agree with you! After seeing my sleeping stats I was kind of taken aback but wanted to figure out if there was something medical preventing me from sleeping well. I found this app called Mobile Sleep Doc (http://www.mobilesleepdoc.com/) that works with the Fitbit and helped me (kind of) figure out how to sleep better. The next step is going to the doctor but I feel like at least now I have more information to present which is always great! Fingers crossed for figuring it all out!
Over the last 2 nights I have tried all hints including starting the sleep stage when I went to bed. Please tell me what I am doing wrong. My heart rate stayed constantly on (According to my app this morning) during the night so it wasn't as if it couldn't be read. I want my sleep stages please.
To add something that might be unique, what causes my restless sleep or wakefulness at night is usually anxiety, having to pee several times (water retention maybe?  weak bladder?).  Also, I have acid reflux and that can cause poor sleep.  And lastly, my husband snores.  Those 4 reasons are the cause for my lack of deep sleep.  I hope you find out the main reason(s) and resolve them. 🙂
@Yennnny   First, if you don't mind, I am going to move this thread to the Sleep Better forum.  You bring up some very interesting observations.  I think this thread will generate more interest and responses in the Sleep Better forum than in the iOS app forum. This Help article explains what is used in calculating a sleep score.  Premium users get more specific information about each component of their sleep score. Sleep changes with age.  Recently, my daughter sent me her sleep stage graph that showed zero minutes awake.  Not typical for me.  I suspect there are higher scores out there, especially from those users who are out right after their heads hit the pillow and open their eyes the next morning. Strong sleeping pills are not the answer.  Some sleeping pills interfere with deep and REM sleep.  Likewise, more than moderate alcohol use interferes with sleep stages. The Fitbit Blog has articles that discuss improving sleep.  The Blog is just one of many sources available to help with sleep.   Last night I got my highest score ever, an 86 on 7 hrs 23 mins of sleep.  I had much less time awake, a lot of deep and REM sleep and a lot of time with my sleeping heart rate less than my RHR.

@DJC_63 This is very interesting!  When changing wrist, do you also change your tracker's settings according to dominant and non-dominat hand? if you're not for sure the information will be different also you may want to check on the sensibility settings if it is normal or sensitive. 🙂I'm eager to know your responses! 😄

Gisselle | Community ModeratorLet's vote for helpful posts!
I do change my settings from non-dominant to dominant depending on which wrist I’m wearing it on. I’m guessing that I sleep on my right side the most, so I probably don’t move that hand much. But I know I move my left arm while i”m “sleeping”. My curiosity is how deeply asleep can I be if my arm is up in the air? I feel like I’m sleeping, other than the occasional times I wake up and realize that my arm is up in the air. Then I go back to sleep, often without putting my arm down.

Thankyou Wilson, I chatted w/ support 4 times this week. Now I was able to send my case number thru via Twitter Support. I am worried that I am getting the run around as i'm approaching the 1 year mark for my device. Any advice?The green lights on the back do not appear. Heart Rate, Sleep and GPS hasn't been working since February.
Have you tried the premium trial yet? It has some good insights into sleep that come with it. Also, check out the Guided Programs in Discover. There are some free and some premium, but they’re target at improving your sleep.

It buzzes, then two lights slowly fade to nothing. To check if it's still in sleep mode, tap and see two dancing lights. In the morning, tap five times firmly and it buzzes and a single light shows when tapped. That light is to show the daily goal progress. Any tap when awake is to tell you your progress - one light for each 20% of your goal. When you sync the next time, it ought to log your sleep. click to read about sleep tracking This link is to the Flex area where you will find the manual and related articles - click

Being an adult, the best i could do is maybe 6 hours.. but it is not fully 6 hours, i mean every 2 hours i wake up to pee.. but i still remember during my younger (teenager) days, i can sleep full 7 hours without get out of bed to pee or what so ever
I would like to be able to add notes to my sleep portion, ie I had a stressful day at work, or I had a glass of wine before bedtime.   This way I could see if this affects my sleep.  I am sure other people would like this also.  Does anyone know where I can enter this for "improvements needed" so company sees it?  thanks
Think it was because the watch was not fully charged ?
Well you would be surprised sometimes that people ask for help and you discover they do not actually use the product. Anyway, in this case, I would say contact Customer Service and request an exchange, it seems your band is simply not working as it should and you should get a free replacement.
Just re-read the question and realized I read it wrong. My bad!

I have 2 dogs about the sane weight as your dogs @heavyfort. I find I sleep better when they sleep with me on the bed 🙂  However, I do think their movement affects my sleep tracking.

This is very insightful @WilsonFitbit --- been struggling with sleep myself cause of work.
I was being told by my sister years back that i move so much!! The highest number I got was 23 haven't awaken once (unless if I want ot use the bathroom)! My guess is when I'm in dream mode I think that's what cause it making me move so much. ugh!

Just started tracking my sleep with the luxe. The first couple days, my sleep graph showed with a line that dipped and weaved through light, deep, and REM sleep. Last night, the graphs all changed to being pretty unusable line graphs. I’ve logged out, reset my phone, and made sure I’m on the most updated version of the app. Anything else to try to get back to the original graph display? Can’t figure out how to share a screenshot from the app (tell me how and I will!). Thanks for any insights!
Well, I am looking for advice on finding the optimal mattress, and assumed your advice that I sleep in a tent was not serious.

I have a small baby in my room that wakes up once a night. Never more than five minutes. Well my sleep stages stop at that point and never record the next 4-5 hours of sleep.so I get 2-3 hrs of info and the classic on the rest.
I have been between 92 and 94 for the past 2 weeks. Now it doesn't monitor at all. totally stopped working. went on site for help and they tell me that my watch doesn't match my name. i explained to the I have upgraded my watch 2 times since being on site, but they have me check somewhere else and when I come back they are gone. What a great support group from FitBit.
Why is my sleep panel  (today only) showing only strange vertical lines only -- it sometimes does this  for the second part of sleep if you have a period of waking but this is the whole seven hours and with no delineation between deep, light and Rem... Any idea why?
Disregard. I upated to the higher sensitivity level. I have no way to delete this post.
I've had mine for at least a year and this was actually the first time it didn't register sleep at all.  sometimes it would revert back to the old data but for the most part its worked fine.  I am going to see what happens. good luck to you..
I too suffer with Insomnia. What works for me is a few dropsof Lavender Essential oil on my pillow, I also use a sleep app called "Sleep Well"  http://srfcty.co/3ZIt  It has two guided meditations, one is based on tightening all your muscle groups from toe to head and relaxing them. The other focuses on using Colour 'energy' around your body. There are various background themes, music or sounds that you can add and also how long you wish it to run for anything from one hour to eight hours. Both work very well and train and condition you to relax your mind and body yo enable better sleep patterns. The other thing I use is music or natural sounds. If you Google Nigel Shaw (Echoes of the ancient forest or Dartmoor Journey) both are great albums to listen too and relax you - perfect for sleep! http://www.seventhwavemusic.co.uk/aboutus/nigel-shaw/ The final thing I use is Essential Oil of Lavender, a few drops on your pillow at night really helps. Like all things what works for one person, may or may not work for another, but what do you have to lose? Hope this helps.
Does any of the Fitbit bands have the feature to wake me up within an interval where I'm in light sleep, just like the Sleep Cycle alarm on iPhone does? In other words, track the light and deep sleeps, but I wanna wake up between 7.00 and 7.30 when I'm in light sleep instead of deep.
Why does my fitbit show 2 different sleep charts? For example one night, it will have sleep stages, then the next night it will show sleep pattern. Why is it not the same graph for every night? Thanks

This has just happened to me too.  My sleep record showed sleep from 23:38 to 07: 21.  I tried to edit the start time as I’d actually slept from 23:00 but just forgot to put my fitbit on after a shower.  I tried to therefore edit the start time of my sleep and it altered my original start time only then tracking from 12:38 - this has screwed up all my statistics which were showing a gradual increase in sleep - as is my goal.  Do you know if there is any way the figures can go back to what they should be?
Hye!When I had my Fitbit set on sensitive, I had the same problem. Maybe it is more accurate when changing it back to normal? For me this really worked and now the sleep monitoring is very accurate. I hope this works!
Hi-don't know if it was just a coincidence but I wore my tracker on the other wrist last night and this morning I had my sleep patterns back!! Might be worth a try.Sent from my iPhone
@obiscott  What Fitbit calls "Times Awoken" includes periods of restlessness along with times when your tracker is in sleep mode and you're up and walking around. I agree that the sleep tracking functionality could be improved upon with more varyance in the display of data, and would invite you to take a few minutes to skim through and add your votes/comments to some of the existing feature improvement requests.

I have been using Fitbit Flex 2 about 3 weeks.  Before I used it, I had some sleeping problems such as being unable to fall asleep over 2 hours after I laid down on the bed. To fix these problems, I bought Fitbit and control my daylife.  I worked out regularly, did not drink much coffee, and went outside at least 1 hour when I do not have any schedule.  Now, I can sleep much better. However, sometimes, this does not work well. What should I do more? Are there any habits you recommend? I took magnesium pills that were known for better sleeping, but I felt pain in my stomach every time. Please share your advice!

Your fitbit won't be able to accurately calculate your number of calories burned unless you have the CHARGE which can be hooked up to a heart rate moniter.  The fitbit can't know your actual level of exertion simply by how many steps you take.  You will need to upgrade to a system that includes a heart rate monitor if you would like an accurate calorie burning count.  Hope this helps.
I am noticing the same thing. When I look in the morning, my HR chart while sleeping looks fine, but after I exercise and look in the evening, there is a spike at 1:30am. It seems to add this back in later, aligning roughly with my peak HR during the day. My sleep restoration HR tracker shows nothing not does my "When you got your minutes" report. Before I noticed the misalignment I went to see a doctor that day at the rushed urging of urgent care line got a bunch of tests and an EKG, which were all fine. While I'm reassured now by HR tracker in the morning and my sleep restoration HR tracking, I'm baffled why Fitbit is adding a HR spike for 1-1:30am later on in the day.
A great natural replacement for sleeping pills is passiflora or passion flower, with some valeriana root. Boil both and drink that tea. It shall relax you and help you get some sleep.

I get remarks that I must be really fit but I'm really not. I struggle with breathing, running style but slowly getting back into it. Well the run club I go to is connected to my gym and we do lots of different types of running. The other night we did resisitance and I always love that. I like sprinting too, however that was a reason that put me off running for a while. I can sprint but I fear the damaging consequences afterwards. I did think about joining a run club, but I am paying enough for my gym at the moment so will stick with that for now.  But yes, I get a lot out of my gym classes and I was so pumped after yesterdays run club I found it very hard to settle down and get to sleep to the point that this morning I struggled with the will power to get up. I even fantasized about going for a run at 7AM before getting ready for work. In reality that would just not happen at the moment.  I've created a solution to avoiding the computer in the evenings but reading about fitness: Reading a book on "The Art of Running Faster" instead of being on the computer, so I am reading up on fitness aka my obsession but improving my sleep. I have wanted to buy a book on fitness but my flatmate who is very fitness orientated also made a point that not all books should be trusted when it comes to fitness? He lent me this one so I will give it a read and work on my running ability.  Hi @Hats26 thank you for sharing. As far as my client's go, I try to make them aware of the possible long term effects of high impact exercise such as running.  Runners are most certainly a different breed because they are very committed and usually self disciplined athletes.  I do see a lot of knee/ankle issues with people that have been traditional runners all of their life.  If you enjoy running and it keeps you active I believe that is great.  Finding the right balance between low impact and high impact exercise can be difficult because we all have comfort areas of how we like to train. I think you are seemingly doing the right things, trying out gym classes etc.  I can understand being pumped up after classes or run club.  Those endorphins can be exhilerating to us and getting to sleep can be tough especially if we trained in the evening.   Reading is great at night, especially a book on health and/or fitness.  Your flat mate is right, not all books can be trusted, just as not all articles and programs should be trusted.  A lot of times their is an agenda behind them, selling something besides the truth.  I trust science and fact, not fads and trends. Hope all is well, keep up the wonderful work, very inspiring to read!

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
I'm going through a surprisingly tough time, as our bed changed and I'm getting used to the new harder mattress. My entire torso is sore, and this understandably makes me a bit crankyBack to the matter at hand..If I gather correctly, these pictures are from a computer screen and from the premium version?I opened my laptop, and I have the premium tryout week going on.There lies another problem, I'm most of the time relying on my phone. I'm on my laptop maybe once a week. And what I can gather, the premium isn't available for the app?So why should I pay for something I'm unable to use.And coming back to my original point, as they are showing us the estimated number, they should easily be able to include an option for seeing the real rhr on the app.And as to your advice, this seems a bit of a task to get done. And of which you have accomplished, good for you.But again, isn't it the company's plan to mainly develop their app? That is because people are relying on our phones. So, shouldn't they develop the app?
I switch it from off on and nothing
Any light or noise is disruptive. I am even finding the light flashing on my Inspire at night tends to interrupt my sleep. Any suggestions on how to manage this?
Does this mean we'll be getting the sleep score back eventually? I've been having to figure out my own based on the (fairly poorly calculated) sleep stages, and that doesn't include heart rate.
I've found it very helpful in keeping track of my moods. I'm bipolar and sleep is one of the most influential aspect of bp. It's also allowed me to see which medications have a positive influence and which don't, making it easier to find just the right medication for me to use. But unless you had a specific goal in tracking your sleep it might be cool and that's all.
Fitbit's "Sleep Stages" divides NREM into two categories, 'Light' and 'Deep'.  In the medical literature there are 4 NREM stages (designated Stage 1 ... Stage 4). Does anyone know which stages 'Light' and 'Deep' correspond to?  I haven't found anything about this on the Fitbit website (or anywhere else).  I could make a guess, but if anyone knows, I'd like to hear about it. thanks
I can't speak for the Flex, but I in my opinion the sleep feature works well if you use it to spot trends in your sleep habits rather than worry too much about the total sleep hours of a specific night. From what I recall, the total sleep hours does not include restless time, yet you may be sleeping/dozing. My sleep hours are sometimes inflated when I read in bed.
I would love to have a Flex to wear at night instead of the uncomfortable velcro arm band and then I would like to use my One during the day. But Fitbit allows only one device on an account. There must be lots of people who would like to be able to switch from one device to another.
I work nights and sleep during the day. How can I adjust my fit bit for that?

Okay so I have read through the boards and looked at numerous posts.  But I cannot find a specific post explaining what Restless truly is according to Fitbit or how they determine it.  If anyone has a specific explaination of what Fitbit see's it as and how it is determined please share or share links for me to review. Thanks, Andhanni.

Everyone has the right to their own opinion, and, normally, you want to share with others what happened to you to protect them. We learn from our own mistakes but also the mistakes of others.
My sleep is automatically tracking again now and all I did differently was to not manually update it on Monday or yesterday morning after manually tracking it for a week. Maybe keep a record of your sleep outside the app (in Notepad or Word or whatever) and not touch the sleep bit of the app (don't even open up the sleep page) until it comes back.  It took 2 days of not manually logging it for me to get the automatic tracking to kick into action again, so hopefully it'll work for you too?

There's a thread here with tips on getting more deep sleep. In general, deep sleep declines as people get older, although this is associated with aging.
My Zip won't track my sleep.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Fitbit needs to sense your heart rate in order to creat the sleeping stage chart.  Try to ware your Fitbit a little tighter, you will get your pretty sleeping stage charts back.  Hope this will help you.
I am beginning this blog for those flying Long Haul flights, Pilots and Flight Attendants on getting enough sleep through the month with the sleep disruption caused by our job.
It's the tics above the graph I'm wondering about. If each tic means that I'm awake, then I wake up over 30 times/night.

Route marches, having a rest and sleeping in about 42oC (107oF) and using equipment as a pillow.. The fittest time of my life and over 55 years ago while doing National Service in the Army. But back to the sleep issue. I find if you are just lying in bed contemplating sleep, virtually no movement my various Fitbit bits will have me showing zero minutes, BUT, if I examine the sleep graph and it has red at the start, I will edit it and change the start time by 1 minute and in last nights case "commence sleep" went for zero minutes to 6 minutes. A few of us reported this last year but it has come to nothing.

Hi @Onightingale02, Thanks for posting. Now that's an awesome sleep! I'm jealous of the time in bed.A lot of us get less deep sleep than they we'd like. Feel free to check out our Deep Sleep Thread, which has many tips and discussion. I think the Fitbit numbers can be helpful, but it's better to go first by how one feels. Are you waking feeling rested? Is your physical performance lagging? When I get too little deep sleep, work in the gym starts to get harder and harder. As far as the awake times go, Fitbit reports it's normal to have up to dozens of them during the night. They are just short enough in duration we don't remember most of them the next day. Sweet dreams!

Hi @RitaCastro Sorry to see you had such a terrible night with a bad migraine. This excerpt from What should I know about Fitbit Sleep Stages explains how your Fitbit device determines if you're asleep: Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep.As you know, your sleep score is comprise of 3 parts: Time asleep - 50 pts, Deep & REM (sleep) - 25 pts, & Restoration - 25 pts. To get an understanding on your sleep score, you'd have to look at each of the 3 parts. On your bad night, your Fitbit probably recorded you as asleep when you were awake but not moving around much. If it recorded a good score for REM & deep sleep as well as Restoration, that probably bumped you up to 85. On your better nights, if your score was on the low side for REM & deep sleep and for Restoration, then you get a score in the 70's. I often wake up before I'm ready to get up, then lay in bed not moving much, which gets recorded as REM or light sleep. Knowing that I can "fool" my Fitbit so it records me as sleeping, I consider the sleep data as interesting but don't rely on it to be extremely accurate. The most important thing is that you feel refreshed and rested after your sleep. I suggest that you don't stress too much about the score.

@SunsetRunner  I put the Flex to sleep when I first sit on the bed, checking my alarm clock. That way it became part of my nightly routine. In the morning, when I turn off the alarm, I wake up my Fitbit. You'll find a way to make it work for you. Welcome to the forums.

I moved my fitbit to my right wrist before I go to bed and is again reading my full nights sleep. So I think I may have been moving to much in the night for it to be read. Does anyone know how long a fitbit alta HR is supposed to last before needing replaced? Mine is close to 2 years old now. Thanks. BJ
I would love to find ways to help me fall asleep and stay asleep that doesn't involve medications. The problem I have with not eating two hours prior to bedtime is that that is the only time I have. I work from 9 to 5. It takes me an hour to get home. So after arriving home, changing out of my work clothes, taking a breathe and then preparing dinner its usually 7ish. I go to bed at 9. So my choices are eating a large breakfast and lunch and no dinner; or eating two hours before bedtime. Any suggestions? 🙄
How do I reset the date and time on my Charge 2?

The sleep tracker is showing the amount of time I'm awake, restless sleep and how long it takes for me to fall asleep, but not REM, etc... Is my wrist just too small?  I'm VERY TINY - under 100 lb, even on a "fat" day.  The wristband is on the smallest hole.   Thanks!
What is the reason/meaning for the longer awake lines in the sleep pattern?
I purchased the Alta HR to track my sleep patterns, as I cannot tolerate my CPAP machine, and I wonder if there are other members of the community like me.
Sometimes it takes a little while for it to show up. Has it shown up yet? If you havent already, I'd suggest restarting your Dashboard too.
I have been having the same issue for weeks as well.
I also always need to wake up and pee at least once, often twice, per night. Plus I woke up due to sitffness building up in my joints. However I am able to fall back to sleep immediately after. Thus I  average 7 hours a night of full sleep, even if it is interrupted. Doing 7 hours in total by adding naps during day helps. If you are unable to fall back to sleep after 3 hours then yes, you have a disturbed sleep cycle. I would suggest you talk to your doctor.
I have noticed for the last 6 months or so that if I walk more than 20 - 25,000 steps I do not sleep at night.  On Saturdays I work out and do most of my errands on foot.  I usually finish from 6 - 8:00 p.m. so this is plenty of time before bedftime.  Coffee and alcohol are not factors because it happens whether I consume them or not.  I looked up restless leg syndrome and this is not a factor either.  I just don't fall asleep all night.  It never happens at any other time.  In fact I started drinking coffee again (one small cup in the morning) because I discovered that this was not a factor.  Does anyone have a clue?
As part of my pre-sleep-ritual, I like to get in bed, read  ink-on-paper, turn out the light and go to sleep.  Fitbit never thinks I'm asleep as I read.  I would contend that the motions that my hands make as I adjust my book and turn its pages is enough to convince it that I am awake. If you watch TV in bed, consider habitualizing hand movements to show fibit you are awake.
Matty70, And how do you "reset the breathing rate on the dashboard"?
I'm experiencing the same thing. My sleep had reached the best it has ever been. I was given a fitbit as a gift. Since the fit bit usage my sleep has declined. I was thinking maybe it's the bright light  it emits at night but now I'm concerned that it's both the light AND the EMF's. I'm not sure but I will experiment.... alternate  a few days of usage. I do know that studies show that sleep can be disturbed by bright light even shining Behind the knees on the skin only!. (Studies regarding jet lag, circadian rhythm etc.)I was wanting to know if other users have discovered a problem with the light by itself??
I thought I slept horribly so I got a Fitbit to confirm what I thought. After 2 months I average 3-4 hours of sleep and I am restless 20-25 times per 8 hours. Is this bad?
I'm a really bad sleeper, so when I purchased my Fitbit charge 2 it was nice to see just how little sleep I got (  averaging 3-4 hours sleep a night) but since the new sleep stages was introduced my tracker now tells me I'm doubling that which I know is wrong as I'm awake so much through the night, does anyone know why this has happened as I know I'm  definitely not getting 7-8 hours a night . I have my tracker on sensitive on my left wrist .
I'm having the same problem so watching this with interest!

The Deep and REM page (Fitbit premium) shows 30 day average and Benchmark comparisons. Time Asleep and Restoration and Sleep Score itself show no such comparison.  It that because age is not a significant factor in these metrics (unlikely as teenagers can sleep for a l-o-n-g time)?  A comparison in the three subcomponents would be very helpful in interpreting the results.  eg a low restoration score compared with younger people is acceptable, whereas a low restoration score against your peer group is not.
I never see lights on my fitbit (other than when I am charging it).  I tap firmly for at least 4 -6 sec and will feel a vibration but no lights.  Sporadically (~50%) of time it will record my sleep pattern anyway. Is my fitbit flex defective?
sleeping heart rate chart is blank on my iphone, estimated oygen variation is working, any solution??

I'm having the same exact issues here. Not sure why it's happening.
Why does my chart say that I slept 20 min longer than I did?  I was looking at the chart at 4:10am and it said I slept until 4:30am.
How can I tell if my flex is in sleep mode? It does not vibrate when I tap it and the lights look the same.
My Alta HR stopped tracking my sleep stages 3 days ago. My Fitbit is fully charged and I am sleeping as usual. I have had my Fitbit for not yet a year and have not experienced this problem. What's going on with the sleep tracking?
Yea absolutely please see attached image.
@angelafoodcake I have found the RHR that Fitbit uses close and the images below, the first of me sleeping the other night on a balmy Spring evening in Melbourne, which makes you aware of your environment and the second image, which shows that it took me a month for my RHR to settle down after an operation. @angelafoodcake wrote:I've had my Fitbit HR since March now and I've been sick many times, and Very Consistenly I notice that my resting HR spikes up to "72" and stays there while I'm at the peak of sickness, and comes down when I'm well. Whatever formula they have seems to be extra magical in predicting the onset of viral illness because it starts to go up 2 days before I get any symptoms. Interestingly, the resting HR doesn't directly relate to overnight HR -- my overnight HR is "normally" 54-59, and when i'm sick and my resting HR is 72, my overnight HR is in the mid-to-high 60s. Most people's reactions to this is that the scale of change is insignificant (I'm a scientist / I get comments from other scientists), and I'd agree except that it's alarming precise and these noticeable spikes *only* happen when I'm sick. Anyone else noticing this magical prediction ability and mirroring of illness state??

I noticed that under my name (my fake name) that I am listed as 'JOGGER' and I am wondering where that comes from. Does anyone know?
Hi Dan, it's hard to say what else it helped.  I am taking cymbalta and gabapentin for nerve pain but it seems the magnesium helped there too.
LisaEl, I can't help with that and none of the advice I received here earlier helped either, although it was good to learn a few things that could be done to try to fix problems. I was ready to bin my Fitbit and had resumed wearing a watch instead, but I decided to put the Fitbit aside for a few days and try again later. Then there was an app update and that appeared to fix the problem I'd had with the sleep recording. I assume many people were having the same problem and Fitbit looked into it. So it wasn't a problem with the Fitbit device itself; the problem was on Fitbit's computers. I have no idea what can be done to retrieve deleted data. Maybe just wait a couple of weeks to see if it reappears. Seems the ball is in Fitbit's court. If you don't get an answer here and you badly need that lost data, request help from their admin.
I was having exactly the same problem and the sleep information was the main reason for getting a Fitbit. So, to say the least I was frustrated and contacted the help folks at Fitbit every morning. Returned my first device but the problem continued with device #2. Then on a whim I tried wearing it on my dominant wrist (right instead of left). It has worked almost flawlessly since then. I sleep mostly on my left side and I think I put my left hand under the pillow often at night which may have interfered with the device. During the day I still wear it on my left arm.
Thanks, Wilson, the points you mention really sensible, Sure I will try to inherit them into my lifestyle. Thank you very much for your reply.
Good morning.    On days that I eat my last meal at 3PM, my night time heart rate drops below 45 BPM (e.g. last night 41 was the 5 minute low).   On these nights, my fitbit deduces very little deep (9%) and REM (10%) sleep.    On days that I eat my last meal towards 9PM, my night time heart rate may only drop to 49.   On these nights, my fitbit deduces that I've experienced twice as much  deep (11%) and REM (20%)sleep.   I suspect that the algorithms for heart rate variability confuse peristalsis with sleep stage during periods of heart rate in the 40s.   I believe my fitbit can't tell the difference between  REM sleep and peristalsis.  Fitbit engineering?  What do you think? Best, Peter
It's fine now. Thanks for the follow up. I rebooted the app and all isgood.
@Kerryog It's great to see that you've visited the Fitbit Community!

Morning Colin, Thank you that sorted it. But, unfortunately I also clicked on "Switch to Activity Record" and it turned my sleep into an activity! Ooops! Don't know how to get it back. Regards Chris
The night of July 7-8 Fitbit stopped making automatic determinations of when I fell asleep and when I woke up.  If I went to the web page (which I haven't used for months but I notice now puts you on the gateway page with the ads twice before you can get to the dashboard) I can enter sleep begin and end times and will get the usual chart of quality of sleep by time.  This is is bad because I can't generally tell when I actually got to sleep.  I assume that this is a software change and I hope that they roll it back before too many others decide that their competitors might be better on sleep tracking.  That being said, they already had a software problem: the Alta HR / IOS App registered time spent being still trying to get back to help as time spent in light sleep so it ofter overreported sleep time.  There is no way that the used could fix that misreporting.   To get to your problem with "asleep" / "restless" rather than Deep / Light / Rem / Awake:  that is usually a problem with heart rate detection and can happen if your fitbit is strapped on too tight or if you are sleeping on the arm that the fitbit is attached to.  I would recommend making the band looser, not tighter at bedtime, and try changing the fitbit to the other arm at night if you are used to sleeping on the side where you wear the fitbit.
Some people find a little time to do power nap at work. Hopefully your boss is understanding enough to let you escape for 20 minutes to take a quick nap.😴  If you keep that nap to 20 minutes and take it between 1:00 and 3:00 PM, you can actually boost your cognitive ability without messing with your sleep schedule. Not sure, if this works for me. 😅

Hello @healthy2022. It's great to see you around! 
 
If work worries are keeping you awake at night, it’s time to implement habits that will keep your stress levels in check and make a lasting impact to ensure sleepless nights become fewer and farther between:
 
Empty your brain: 
 
If your mind races with a million to-dos the minute you lay your head on the pillow, keep a notebook by your bed to jot down thoughts as they arise. By doing this, you know they’ll be there waiting for you in the morning, clearing your mind of clutter and worry. If you’ve developed a habit of staring at the clock and watching sleepless hours tick away, cover up the clock and only use it as an alarm.
 
When all else fails, get out of bed: 
 
If you find yourself unable to sleep after lying in bed for more than 20 minutes, get up and move to another room. Tossing and turning only serves to perpetuate the worrying thoughts that keep you awake. While it can be tempting to turn on the TV, catch up on emails, or scour Instagram, opt for relaxing, low-stimulus activity such as reading a magazine. This will help take your mind off whatever’s making you anxious and allow you to reset, hopefully making your next sleep attempt successful.
 
Hope this helps.

Thanks for sharing valuable information on sleeping. I share your sentiments good sleep come with good habits that prepare you to have a good sleep. And i think having a good sleep is a magic pill that a lot of people take for granted. Your body needs the rest does not matter that you are a workout maniac or a computer wiz who is hooked on to electronics. If you don't give your mind and body the rest it deserves it backfires spectacularly and i am testament to that. Cheers 👍
Disclaimer: I'm not a doctor and if you have any worries, you should take them up with one of those. I wouldn't be too worried about the one percentage point because the striped range is the typical range (simple guideline) for each sleep stage. You may also want to go back and see if this is a normal reading for you. I almost never check my sleep stages, but your description sounds a lot like me, so I went a couple of weeks back to check and realized that according to Fitbit, my REM and deep sleep are under the range (same range as yours) 90% of the time. REM most often at 10%. My light sleep goes from 60-70+%.I have years of sleep issues and daily fatigue behind me (still unresolved), but I had a sleep study last year that came back normal (I still don't fully believe that). A good and easy tip for better sleep is to review your sleep hygiene to see if there are rooms for improvement. Getting enough sleep and learning de-stress is also important.Other tips would include seeing your doctor about depression, sleep and/or fatigue if you haven't already. Feeling tired is often a symptom of depression, but it can also be as simple as not having enough of certain vitamins or minerals. Vitamin D and Iron are usually the first suspects in my experience. Another (slightly worse) suspect is sleep apnea. Hope some of my (purely as a patient) sleep knowledge was of some help

Try again. Fail again. Fail better.
Hi. I logged my sleep for the first time last night . It did not give me a percentage. Where are you looking ?On mine, I do see that I was restless 17X and awake 3 times.On another note- If you are only getting 68 % quality sleep- this fit bit tracker may be saving your life. Perhaps you have sleep apnea and really should take the results of your sleep  to the doctor. Im interested to see how it comes out. Good luck.
you're not alone get checked for sleep apnea  I have that problem and I am restless and get about 3 to 4 hours sleep a night if I'm lucky
It looks like the data is being presented a little better now,  Essentially the update just makes the presentation of the data documenting what we all do a little harder to understand, originally you could just glance at it and see what was happening - for example you could just see the last 7 days of data but now when it's no the end of the week you only get a few days of data and have to play with the app to find the rest of the 7 days data.
@destca01 Good luck with the sleep study, hope they can resolve this for you.  Wearable trackers are usually pretty good at getting a close estimate of your sleep stages. The problems are we are all individuals and are all a bit different. Most of the more accurate trackers take data from heart rate and movement sensors and extrapolate your sleep stages from that. The math involved is designed to give reasonable results for an average person. Also, things like your device loosing heart rate data because it slipped on your arm will throw off the estimates.  Wear your device during the sleep study and you can then compare it's estimates against the gold standard used by the clinic. If you think of it, then share your findings with us. I would love to know.
Fitbit is an analytical model of how you use your body.  And all models are wrong, but some models are useful.  So, a better question is why are people getting depressed over a device that generates some information based on your heart rate and hand movements?  It's not an EEG machine.  It's not even an EKG machine.
 
I would like everyone here to use this platform as a useful tool that helps you take better care of yourself, and not as a video game to be won.

I have a couple things I do to help me sleep, I don't do them all every day but I find they do help. I take a melatoinin pill every night before bed.On the days I do exercise, I keep my more strenuious workouts to the evening(I find that I get tired to the point where I really don't want to do a whole lot after). When I feel particularly anxious, or tight, I will do some restful yoga poses.I sometimes, more often than not as of late, listen to a guided podcast that is supposed to help. I often find I sleep better when I use it. I also sleep with a heating pad on my shoulder or lower back.

Hello. One day last summer, I was pretty tired but did my bench press session anyway. And that day I could not sleep at all. And since then, I get insomnia every time I do bench press or push-ups. (For a few weeks I had trouble sleepting early when I also do dead-lift or squats, but this got well soon.) I'm 37 years old. And everything was fine before last summer. It has been almost a year but still have the symptom. I tried to do the session in the morning, but didn't work. When I do chest-exercise, I get this strange feeling of tension, the feeling that my body or my head has been alerted. I searched on google and find out that Magnesium could help my condition.  Can anyone explain what this is and what I can do?And can anyone tell me whether magnesium can be of help? FYI:I drink one up of coffee before 2pm. I avoid drinking coffee at night because it keeps me awake.
my fitbit is set to normal but it still has all the restless lines, does anyone know why?
Yes, turning off quick view was the answer for me. (A Fitbit support person told me that.) I put the Charge 2 back on to wear at night after doing that. That's the answer, folks.
Hi,
 
Sometimes I have a great sleep, however, often I also have some nights were I get less sleep or sleep of lower quality. This results sometimes in eyes under the bags and dark circles. However, I was wondering how much time is needed to lose the bags under eyes and dark circles? Is there any formula/indication of how long it takes to recover from a (few) bad day(s) of sleep?

So you can have confidence in that side proviced you keep the charge up.

I am in a Sience field also, I love looking at the past trends on the fitbit. I can tell when I have had a busy work day just me seeing how much I walk around (and sometimes not walking around stuck at desk all day).
I assumed that they only made it specifically for the mobile apps, as I don't have it on my computer either.
Hi thanks to my Blaze and now my Versa I am finding a correlation in this area. Consider the “dawn phenomenon” if as Versa says I was awake instead of asleep then my body will release glucose to prep for the needs of being awake and active. If you have had similar experiences please share. If you consider it too personal well that’s ok. By the way there is an excellent Diabetes Community on Fitbit.  Guess it’s time to set the bedtime reminder, lavender on pillow and a light book (so my face will not get squished lol) ...
My 30-day average is just slightly over an hour per night, although I do wonder how much accuracy this has. I am not always fully rested when I wake up, but I wouldn't say my sleep is that poor either.
Since changing phones (iPhone 6S to an X), I am getting a simplified sleep record. States the heart rate is the issue but I can see the record of my heart monitor overnight. Any suggestions?
I have a flex but even before that I had a different make and showed my sleeping pattern as shocking and I'd sure love a full night's sleep as takes me forever to get motivated due to not sleeping right. This is slowing me down and my memory is shocking due to it all and also affects my epilepsy.
Hi @dave_in_ni - I agree. Some people just need less sleep. Before I retired, 5 hours/night was enough to keep me going strong. Retired, I‘m more in the 7 hour category. But like you, my body has a natural wake up time. No matter when I go to bed, I am wide awake by 7:00.
@Suebeedoo, my doc does not think I have sleep apnea, as I score low on the questionnaire and my husband confirmed to him that I do not snore, nor am I drowsy during the day. It is of interest anecdotally because I had an atrial fibrillation, and that is SOMETIMES caused by sleep apnea...though he is 99% sure it was caused by my chemo stressing my heart. If the fib returns, he will schedule a sleep study...though I am also scheduled for a 14-day, 24 hour heart monitor to start next week, which will also show if I am still experiencing cardio stress, and if so, and it is during my sleeping hours.Thank you for your support!Sent from my iPad
That sounds interesting - I've never done yoga or even bed yoga before! I'll check it out!
Thanks.... Yep, definitely going to chat over with the doc next week.... I’ve had ECG done in the past and an ultrasound on my heart couple of years back, due to a resting HRM creeping up to 110, but that was down to an episode of PTSD due to stressful events... All results tested normal and things settled down... Until these episodes occurring 😕 Bit worrying when generally pretty fit and healthy 😞
@Emamino88 That happens to me a lot! What usually helps me is singing in my head. I just sing in my head and get to relax and eventually fall asleep.
 
Another thing I do is reading. I start reading a book and suddenly I am sleeping.
 
It is worth trying!

So, every morning, I get up and I sync my Ionic and I check my sleep score for the previous night. It's almost like an addiction! It can vary from low 70's to high 80's and the charts look really cool. Trouble is, it bears absolutely no relation to how I feel in the morning! A high score does not mean refreshed and feeling energetic and sometimes with a low score I feel great! So I am left asking myself the question, what is the point of the sleep score?
Hey everyone, My wife and I went out Thanksgiving evening to save on our first smartwatches. We really wanted to get the new Ionic's but there were no savings on those yet so we decided to purchase some Blazes. I have a question regarding sleep patterns. I currently work 12 hour rotating shift work and have the hardest time whether days or nights to find energy. I get about 5 hours of sleep on day shift and about 6.5 on night shift. I am leaving my job next week and switching to permanent nights. Has anyone made this transition and can they tell me if sleep/energy increased? I have a really busy life outside of work and have become extremely lazy due to fatigue.Thanks to all that read! V/R, Dennis Glenn a.k.a Chaloopabatm4n (lol)
To me it looks like the Fitbit is registering particularly active sleep. The spikes are in the middle of deep periods without cycling through other stages. I would guess you were kicking or your heart rate went up or something like that.
@overthecascades  If you have the usb port to spare, keep your dongle inserted and don't worry about it. It will sync every twenty minutes or so if you have new steps to update. To force a sync, you can open the FitBit Connect software on the computer and have it "sync now" and on the cell phone, you just open the app and sign in. You're catching on just fine!

Hi. I'm new to all of this and I'm not sure if I'm interpreting my sleep data correctly. I'm the most concerned about the restless sleep. Does this mean I was restless for 18 minutes 11 times (198 minutes), or 11 times totalling 18 minutes? Thanks for any feedback.
That happens to me too @FoxMan32 😂
 
There's no problem if I read during the day, but if I read at night (and scientific literature in particular), I will definitely fall asleep quickly 😅

I (f 31) have almost no recorded REM sleep on my Sense 2 Fitbit.last night I had an 8 h and 33 minute sleep, which is great. On this it recorded 3% REM sleep.. so that’s only 18 minutes.I’ve switched fitbits with my partner for a night and he has an Inspire 3. Our results stayed the same so it’s not an error in my Fitbit.I am not overweight and never snore. Also I can always remember that I’ve had a dream. I’ve read that you can dream in light sleep as well. But I think most dreams are from the REM stage.is it possible that Fitbit is just missing my REM because my heart and respiratory stats are just a bit different from the regular? I really hope it’s just a flaw.. thank you in advance for a reply
You can edit your sleep log to remove the time you were up but forgot to turn off sleep mode.  Go to the LOG screen then Sleep.  Above and to the right of the sleep bar you'll see a little page symbol.  Click on that to edit.
I bought a Charge HR to track my sleep.  It did a terrible job.  I upgraded to a Charge 2, and it was no better.  Fitbit replaced it, and the replacement also did a terrible job.  No matter how well I sleep, it logs only 1-3 hours of sleep.  Does anyone else have this problem?
Sensitive setting could pick up movements from others in bed ( your partner or pets).
Thanks for telling us where the information went. I have missed it. I can understand that the company has to find revenue streams.  I don't plan to sign up for premium, however.
I loved the new way... the old way sucks lol. Bring it back Fitbit! 🙂
They did an update yesterday and mine is working again.
15-25% for REM I am extremely tired, that's why I have no problem going to sleep.
I manually put in the same info as you to test this and came up with different problems. While I was able to input it correctly, it only shows 30 minutes of sleep on my dashboard while it does show 8 hours and 30 minutes in the log. Also, I cannot delete the manual entry and when I sync'd my tracker it did not upload my actual sleep info. Update: After I logged out of the website and resync'd, the full manual log of 8 hours and 30 minutes shows on the dashboard. I was also able to delete the manual entry. However, my recorded sleep is now gone. It's also now missing from the app as well.
I think that data and numbers are great. But sometimes those same numbers can cause a spiral of doubt when one shouldn't exist. How do you feel? do you feel rested? do you remember dreams or does the entire night just zoom by? Do you lie awake for hours or do you fall asleep relatively quickly? If the answers to all the questions aren't troubling, than I would suggest that your tracker is giving you what it perceives to be your sleep pattern on what I imagine is your pulse fluctuations through out the night. It is good information to have around patterns- are you more restless during the same time each night, did you sleep worse because you are coming down with a cold, etc... but I definitely wouldn't worry about any of it unless your answers indicate you should.

Hello @kroshik, @simba20. Welcome to the community forums! Thank you for your great input! 
 
@kroshik It's true. Seems that exercise decreases sleep complaints and insomnia. The effects of aerobic exercise on sleep appear to be similar to those of sleeping pills. 😊
 
See you around.

WavyDavey is right. It's based on motion. I often watch the news from my bed at night and my Fitbit thinks I'm asleep, because I'm not moving. It also says that I'm still asleep when I lay in my bed for a while after waking on the weekends. It does not understand the idea of "soaking up the silence." 😉

Fitbit can detect naps, provided they’re long enough (see this article: Naps at least an hour in length will be automatically detected by your device and stored in your sleep history). What Fitbit cannot do is consolidate naps with the sleep that occured on the same night. However, I’m not aware that it substracts naps from the main sleep period, as you are saying. Here is an example from broken sleep that occured following a long intercontinental flight and the jetlag that resulted from it:  I was able to get about one hour of sleep at 10.13pm (considered as a nap), then slightly under two hours at 00.36 (also considered as a nap), and finally about three hours at 4:01am (considered sleep, with sleep stages, score and all). Naps weren’t added to the sleep period, but they weren’t substracted either. However short it was, the sleep period was rated on its own merits. Sometimes, if/when your sleep is all over the place, Fitbit may not be able to detect sleep stages, even if your sleep was long enough. Maybe this is what happened in your case. It looks like you’ve only been using your Fitbit for a week or so. You should probably use it for a while before deciding its sleep feature is buggy.

Mine looks like this too, which is why I came to this site looking for answers.  It isn't every night, but its enough that its annoying, and if I want to know my average time asleep, this invalidates those figures.  It looks like there are sometimes several hours where the device isn't recording anything at all.  Charge 2 as well, by the way.
Without knowing which tracker model you are using, it sounds like you might be using the 'Begin Sleep Now' button.  Generally that is not required, and you are better off just letting Fitbit by itself detect when you are asleep.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

One thing that's needed is getting your body used to going to bed earlier by making yourself tired. You can try staying up late a couple of nights in a row (say on weekends), and set the alarm early. That should make you tired enough to want to go to bed earlier the following nights.

Hello! So getting too little REM sleep can be an area for concern, but so can getting too much. Ideally, you guys have been in a sleep lab and know how much REM you guys are sleeping. Barring that (those things can get quite expensive), if you're reaching about 20-25% REM sleep, that's quite typical (give or take a few percentages to account for variance and the fact that we're all unique). When you guys say "little" or "low" REM sleep, how much are you guys talking about? Sources: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Understanding-Sleephttps://blog.fitbit.com/sleep-stages-explained/ The fitbit link is a more simplified version of understanding sleep stages, since Fitbit also simplifies the conception of sleep stages for our Charge 2.
I am a person that does not like taking pills in general. Unless I have to. I try to find alternative ways first.Perhaps a glass of warm milk or tea. A good book. Soothing music, a few suggestions. They may not always work for everyone. But it may be worth a try. If nothing else works perhaps the pills will. Sleeping pills maybe a good temorary soultion if nothing else works. I have never tried them yet.I also heard about the side effects and things. Hence my hesitation on trying them. But others may nothave these effects. I think it's up to the person.
How accurate do you find your sleep log?  I apparently wake 10 - 20 times each night and only actually sleep for between 2.5 and 4 hours despite being in bed for nearer 8.  I know that I do wake on occasion but find it difficult to believe that I sleep for such a short period.
I get up, climb down my stairs and let me dogs outside.  Turn on the TV, go to the bathroom....  Then I take my tracker off, and get in the shower.  I'm up a good 15 - 20 minutes before I take my tracker off.

I'm having trouble, or maybe didn't understand?  I thought the HR Fitbit would track my actual sleeping habits?  Just to input my time to bed and wake up isn't how I read the advertisement.  I'd thought this would actually track 'how' I slept?  Am I wrong?  The less expensive model would do all I need without the sleep track, which doesn't work as I'd thought!
Thanks for this, I do know I have thyroid problems that affect my body temperature regulation, and I have been tested for other issues in the past but not recently. I didn't even think about it possibly affecting my sleep, I'll ask at my next appointment.
The clockface of my versa, as it is, has a quite high intensity of blue wavelengths. It is well-known that blue light after sunset and while sleeping is very detrimental to the body's circadian rhythm and therefore the ability to get really good sleep. As I'd like to look at my watch after 7 pm and also use it to check the time, when I wake up during the night (for lucid dreaming), it would be very important, to have a built-in feature, which can be used to reduce the color temperature during the evening and the night, like f.lux does for the computer. Imo this should be a basic feature of every "fitness" watch, but it doesn't seem like fitbit has it. Is there an app that accomplishes this adaptation to the day-night cycle?
Uh read the article. Duh!
Is everyone else having issues with their FitBit Charge5 no longer tracking sleep. this device is almost brand new
Hmm, good observations.  Did you come to any conclusion?   My Fitbit registers me awake usually 20+ times/night, whereas my husband who has the snoring issue registers less awake times.  I’m thinking I need to try setting my watch to normal rather than sensitive and see if I still get any detailed results but with less awake sensitivity.
My dashboard shows many many, many logs of sleep when I know I wasn't actually wearing my fitbit to bed. Any one else have this issue? It goes back over 2 years....some logs were during the day so it could have been naps...but many of them are for the whole night. Very weird.
Everyone is different. I have mine set to sensitive and non-dominant hand. My sleep varies, but I move around at night, adjusting my blanket, checking the clock, turning on the radio, etc and it all adds up to restlessness or being awake, so that is why my percentage can be lower. Read this article on how sleep is tracked. It might help you understand it a bit more.  click You shouldn't be so tired, so maybe a trip to see your doctor would be in order. At least the doctor could rule out the usual things which could account for being tired.

This reminds me of my weekly poker nights at friends houses. Usually if my luck was good I would leave on time and try to get into bed without waking the wife. She always knew to the minute what time i snuck in. I tried everything to be quiet(removing shoes on stairs, even oiling door hinges)but nothing worked except if my luck was bad, I usually stayed a little later and drank a little more but I forgot to be quiet, stumbling up the stairs, sitting on the dog who would always yelp, and rolling into wife. The next morning she always had to ask me when I got in because she didn't hear me!!!  Fitbit needed...lol

I totally agree with this. Any time I workout in the evening, my body gets all ramped up and I always have a restles sleep. Working out in the morning gets me ramped up for the day ahead of me and I am beat by the time I get to bed at night.   I have to add that my focus is much better when I workout in the morning as well because I hit my stride sooner in the day! My productivity is way better.
Electromagnetic fields (e.g. Bluetooth and Wifi) disrupt melatonin (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23051584/) Furthermore, the results show the significance of disruption of melatonin due to exposure to weak EMFs, which may possibly lead to long-term health effects in humans.Maybe take off your Fitbit an hour before sleep and leave your Fitbit off during the night.
Restart Fitbit.For my Alta, it was set it up to charge (Alta in ’bracket’, usb end into computer) then push button on usb end 3 times). now it shows that the Fitbit is a compatible app and connected to sleep IQ BUT I don’t see any Fitbit data. @DimitriC wrote:Restart what? Please let me know as soon as possible. Thanks.--Dimitri Crockett
For me, it really depends on how tired I am.  If I'm exhausted I won't move much, but if I'm not too tired, I might move a lot.
you can add your suggestion here https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Suggestions/idb-p/features. if it gets enough votes, it could be taken into consideration for future updates..

Back pain is one of the most common physical ailments. Studies show that eight in 10 Americans have back pain at some point in their lives, usually in the lower back. Treatments for lower back pain relief range from simple to complex, and the right course for you depends on how long you’ve been hurting, the severity of your pain, the location of your pain, and whether your pain is structural or muscular.
For you who wish to treatments for lower back pain, some of the following treatments might help.
1. Know when to make an appointment

 
Once back pain lasts for more than three months, it becomes chronic. “If pain becomes sharp and keeps you from sleeping, starts radiating down the front or back of your leg, or wraps around your side, get to the doctor,” says Strassberg. Another clue you should get medical attention: It’s “directional,” meaning it hurts more when you sit or stand in certain positions, she says...

Hi, after years of use the fitbit Alpha HR I got a new Luxe with the new software upgrade but the readings fo HRV seems extremely low - 15-17ms - which would suggest I am very ill! I am quite a stressed person but also fairly fit - RHR 55-65 which is apparently excellent for a woman my age. Has anyone else had issues with low HRV readings?
If i may bring in another piece of advice which is a continuation of keeping it dark. Making your bedroom as dark as possible, for example i have two black-out sheets in front of my sliding glass doors which are the only windows in the room. Doing this makes the bedroom so dark that i cannot see my hands in front of me. For me this has increased my quality of sleep a lot. Note: I also use f.lux for quite some time now... it helps.
My average amound of sleep is 3 hours and some nights its as little as 1 1/2 hours. I have insomnia so this isnt exactly a huge shock, and im taking melatonin tablets in order to help get my sleep to a better level. However im wondering if anyone has any tips before bed or while in bed in order to get some more restful sleep as my energy levels are truely horrific and its proving a right pain in the arse as im doing my A Levels. Absolutely any advice or suggestions would help immensely!
Hey @SunsetRunner nice to see you around. 
 
I noticed that you're talking about your sleep details after a long night. If you're having issues getting you sleep information on your Fitbit, I'd suggest to charge it and sync it with your mobile device. You can also check this very useful information about sleep: What should I know about sleep stages? If you need further assistance with this, you can post in our Help Community Forums.
 
I'd also recommend reading some tips on how to sleep better in our Fitbit Blogs, these are really helpful:

Hi @SunsetRunner  When I first started the CPAP I was fully in and used it solid for 48 nights straight. I kept hoping for that "wow this is going to change my life" moment so many say they have when they start CPAP, but no such luck. I am aware of the many issues obstructive apnea can be associated with and may even cause, and there is no doubt it helps with my snoring. Yet I still feel and score more restless with it on. The possibility I may need to re-commit for a longer period is a legitimate one. Though I wonder more if I even truly have obstructive apnea.  Glad to hear the CPAP is working for you and appreciate your feedback. Cheers!
Hi everybody, I'm a new owner of a Charge 2 and one of the main resons of my purchase has been that I want to improve the quality of my sleep.I've already tracked the sleep of 4 nights and I was wondering if there is some way to add LABELS to each night, like "PC before going to bed", "heavy meal", "sex", "reading before sleep" and so on.This in order to find correlations between my actions and the quality of my sleep. For an example the android app "Sleep as Android" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep) has the label feature.

I have tried both normal and sensitive sleep choices.  I am thinking this is as accurate as I am going to get.  I usually have anywhere between 17-37x restless in one night.With insomnia and sleep apnea I'm thinking that is pretty normal.  If I go to bed earlier a few times a week I am more rested.  So i look at how I feel in the morning.  I comparehow long I have kept my sleep apnea mask time on and compare it to the chart provided by Fitbit.  I am okay with this now.
I will check it out! Thank you!
Exactly one week later and this is EXACTLY what I’m searching for. Apparently my iPhone will track this info for me, but we have decided NOT to keep our phones in our bedroom at night. It seems that no matter what settings I choose, some sound or another goes off and disturbs my light sleeping husband. Is there no way to do this with my Fitbit wearable? Cuz I used to wake up to it... thinking I should go back o o if it could wake me during the right sleep cycle. Right now I’m using a Phillips light with bird abounds to wake me,e which is heavenly.
Thank you, I have actually thought about switching to the charge but I'm kind of picky and don't think I'd like that you can always see it.  Although, it would be more comfortable for sleep I'd assume.
I want to shut off the Sleep Mode.  I sleep MUCH more poorly with it on.  
 
Thank you.

I totally agree with you, but I dislike Fitbit trying to tell me that their analytics are just as accurate as those generated in a sleep lab. I also take issue with the fact that the reports ignore chunks of sleep data because I had to get up to go to the bathroom and I am having to log in those times because the sensor stop recording. This isn't why I paid to get the data.
It doesn’t. Do you know how I can check which update is my most recent? Ijust restarted my phone and nothing changed. Thx 😊!
I have the Charge 2 so I guess I will be getting the new sleep charts.  It's just a mystery as to when!

Welcome to the Fitbit Community, @Sychnant. I appreciate your assistance @JohnnyRow.
 
@Sychnant It's weird that your Fitbit device tracked sleep and steps at the same time. You can perform a restart as instructed on this help article in case that there's a glitch with your device.

I don't have insomnia that often, maybe once or twice a week. But when I do, I don't need a reminder to "get more sleep"! Anyway, when I remove the Fitbit, I'm less anxious and can fall asleep more easily.

If you are dizzy, there is some problem.  I generally run a RHR between 40 and 43, but at night I am in the 30s.  I know that my heart has slowed a little since I got older (I'm 67), but I have no dizziness.  Your cardiologist can determine if your heart is perfusing your brain adequately. Your heart will keep up with your demand for the most part, so don't worry about it too much!  I run a little (maybe 6 miles/day) but I'm basically not an athlete, stay healthy and you'll be OK.  Good luck!
Hi there @lynnbaum . If you have an erroneous sleep log recorded, you can definitely edit and/or delete it from your profile. Just go to Log > Sleep tab > "Click to edit" or "Click to delete" at the top right corner of the sleep log box.

I don't either. I did for a while and although I found the tracking data interesting, I didn't find it useful and now prefer to give my wrist a rest and save a little on battery power.
So many conspiracy theorists!  Now anytime one doesn't get sleep stages, you're going to blame it on Premium?  There have been plenty of times long before Premium when users didn't always get sleep stages.

I'm wondering same. I see that both apps are connected (in the SN app and the FitB app) but no data shows. Have you learned how we fix it? I'd really like it synched! TIA!
Did the Breathing Rate feature get fixed for anybody?  Besides working for only one day, it always shows "No Data".  😞
I've had sleep problems since I was born (34 now) and I've tried other sleep trackers, obviously Fitbit is the most accurate, because it's attatched to my skin, but there's one caveat I have:I like that it does the "sensitive" setting, but I wish it called it "deep sleep" rather than just "sleep" and considered the "restless" time to be "light sleep".  Because I DO sleep 8 hours, and it always says 3.5 or something around there which seems really innacurate, though I know it's correct in it's own way. (Also, I never hit my goal of 8 hours.  But I guess you could go around that by changing your goal time to something really low.) Is there some reason other sleep trackers differentiate it between "deep" or "REM" and "light" but consider you asleep the whole time, but Fitbit considers it "asleep" and "restless" and DOESN'T count the "restless" as sleep at all?
Has anyone found a fix for this? Same issue. Sleep disappeared and open is highlighted to click.
I personally have no problems wearing my flex at night or any other timebut do miss it like crazy if it is not on,just the same as if my watch wasnot on,,,,,which I do not wear to sleep and don`t miss it then. Flex onlybothers me if it is too tight which naturally you re-adjust for comfort...sleepy
Hey there @SunsetRunner, that's very interesting! For me it works the opposite way 😞  If I don't workout in the evening I can't sleep well.  Buuut I found out that I don't need much, with a 30-min walk I'll be good 🙂
 
See you around! 😄

Memory foam vapes!  They say the fumes subside after a while, but I haven't found that to be true at all, there's still an "aroma" that eminates from it.It's like sleeping in quicksand...once your indent is created, changing sleep position feels like traversing a crater wall.It gets hot under the body.There is no edge to the mattress.It's horrible.

It might. Another thing about electronics, the stimulation from watching movies or surfing the Internet can prevent good sleep sometimes. I can't tell you how many times I thought to check email before bed, then kept waking up thinking about some email... I like books the best for bedtime, but I hear that e-readers like Kindle are very nice, and the technology makes it similar to reading a book without a huge light shining in your face.

My numbers are that high too. They were in the mid 60's when I was walking 4 miles a day, but I decided to try running 5k and hurt myself and haven't worked out in 4 months. It's slowing climbed to increasing about 20 bpm. Plus I've gained 15 pounds. My resting heart rate alone is enough to alarm me back to getting healthy again.
Thank you @WilsonFitbit I have not heard from the Support Team as yet. Not sure how long they generally take to respond. I will wait on the outcome and let you know if there is anything else you can help with or maybe escalate the case for me? Many thanks, Mel
reset it to what? you charge 2 will pick up the time based on where you designate that you live or when it synchs with your phone....

I am going to look into sleep apnea. My deivated septum is not bad at all. Infact a dotor has told me its not even worth going under surgery for =). Last week I slept for 1.15 hours =( I was exhasuted!!!
I have had my Charge 2 for over 2 months and it has been tracking my sleep correctly. It has only starting tracking incorrectly the last couple of days. e.g if i slept from 10:50pm to 6:36am that's around 7 hours 46 minutes. according the fitbit iOS app its 6 hours 29 minutes. also the sleep stages section the numbers dont add up.below is what the app says:awake- 1h 17mREM- 1h 23mlight- 4h 5mdeep- 1h 1m. if you add that together it doesn't add up to 6h 29m. whats strange is that if i go into the graph that shows the stages and tap the 3 dots and "edit log" if i dont make any changes and click save for a brief second the app shows the correct total as 7 hours 46 minutes. maybe the app has a software issue. hopefully someone else has had this problem.
@BradTad Do you have Fitbit Premium? It's with the latest app update. I think it might also be a server side update that gets pushed to individual users. https://blog.fitbit.com/fitbit-sleep-profile/
Hey @Bunggle, I don't see any Android app updates since May 22 and no scores either?

What happens to my data because I left it in sleep mode?@hanna287Your data is safe and sound. The only difference between the sleep record and a timed activity is are tghe Filters being used to determine the activity. With the sleep record the Fitbit senses a predetermined non activity and assumes you are asleep and when you stop the tracker that is your sleep record. You can Log into your Sleep activity and edit that record and you will see your steps etc will be shown correctly in your Activity log. Hover over the record and the edit and trash can appears. You will notice when you edit the sleep record there is an option to change the whole record to an activity record..... Reason: In the early days of Fitbit, Fitbitters were setting there trackers to record an activity and they had a sedentary time near the start of that activity..... Then there was panic, I have lost my activity record and it was in the Sleep log area. Hence the option to swap the record type. See how you go.

@Stacyhello  The Flex doesn't have a nudge type vibration. It only vibrates with a silent alarm, when you've reached your goal, when you enter or exit sleep mode. It shouldn't be vibrating. Sometimes a good restart solves many problems. Follow the procedure and do it three times to ensure it's done. click If you continue to have problems, there is a link at the bottom of the page to email support.Be sure to tell them what steps you've taken. Let us know what happens. Welcome to the forums.

HiI just got the versa and did the update once it was out of the box The sleep tracking never worked for meAnd i just add the hours manually in the fitbit app to keep track How do i fix this?
It used to calculate by day, but something changed and I can't figure out how to change it back.
How do I use the manuals to fix this? It's not tracking my sleep.
Hi @Debbie2012, Try logging out of the Fitbit app, then restart your phone and log back into the app. See if that fixes it, and let us know.

Completely the same with me. Think it needs a middle ground, they are very extreme.I'm taking mine back, as it's not giving accurate readings. Thanks.Sent from my iPhone
@NellyG It does sounds weird! However, it works all the time! Specially for those insomnia nights, singing in your head will eventually get you to sleep. Another thing that I have tried recently was putting some chill out/nature sounds/relax music on Youtube while on bed. I got relaxed and just woke up the next morning. You can also try that to see how it goes!

It's happened once to my hubs new Inspire HR this week and on my Charge 3 for the last 5 of 7 nights. there's so much 'traffic' on the boards about people hating the sleep score that we can't seem to find any info or help for not getting a full nights recording or random sleep hours or intermittent sleep recording.
I do not wear my Fitbit One on my arm to measure sleep. I feel that arm movements are too frequent to measure my sleep. Instead, I fasten it to the waistband of my pjs. I think body movement is more accurate this way. My numbers seem to be more stable this way. Also, I just started using a white noise app on my phone. This is also helping me with my sleep pattern.
My FitBit gives me lower readings than my oxymeter. I think it's probable that your Fitbit along with your 6 friends are getting readings below what is accurate.  Mmy fitbit says at night my oxygen is 95-97%.  That is lower than normal for me but I am currently not near my oxymeter so I have to wait to get home to compare the accuracy.
Since my original post, I have had only one other strange sleep graph occurrence: on July 25. All others have been as expected. Sorry to hear of your experience. Very frustrating!
The same thing happened to me. I know I set it for my sleep time and my wake time, but it would not read the data this morning. So I went on the Log tab to input my sleep time and wake time manually.As soon as I put the times in, it must have synced with my Force, because the information came up including times I was awakened during the night.
@SunsetRunnerThe peak that you point with the yellow arrow I see is not fluctuating.This is usually a sign of a manually added activity, did you want to add an activity for the PM and it went in as AM?
without being rude, might ask about your age.  As we get older, apparently body gets less efficient at making melatonin which is key in getting into that deep rested sleep.  We got some for the dog for his skin of all things, been taking it for about a week.  Sleeping soundly (98% last night) but seeming to have more vivid dreams so maybe that means more REM sleep? Also, depends on what you're doing before bed as far as winding down.  Apparently working on tables/smartphones pre-bed actually stimulates your brain which can make sleeping less likely.  Last one, what do you eat and when prior to going to bed?  Eating more bio-available foods will minimize body's efforts on digestion...kind like why eating big animal based meal prior bed can be bad because it takes the body a LOT of energy and effort to digest all that (what some like Brandon Brazier call nuturiten poor foods -- takes way more energy to digest than benefits the body).

When I go to the bathroom, I hardly open my eyes and I go back to bed immediately.

i think it just tracks how many times you move your arm. I usually get around 20-25 restless a night but when I wear it on my ankle I only get 5-8 which is about right I tend to roll over a bit. Is there a reason it has to be on the non dominate wrist?
Per our Sleep Help Article:
 

What is the difference between the normal and sensitive sleep setting?
Your Fitbit tracker's settings can record your sleep in either "sensitive" mode for extremely detailed sleep reporting or "normal" mode for a more basic idea of your sleep patterns. Adjust your sleep mode in device settings.

The normal setting counts significant movements such as rolling over as being awake, and is appropriate for most users.
The sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep

If your Fitbit tracker is worn consistently each night with the same setting, the data that it produces should be useful.

 
 Unless you are specifically attempting to track sleep disorders or something similar, you should use the "normal" sleep tracking setting.
I get up once per night, and my fitbit counts my sleep as stopping at that point. Is there a way to resume sleep monitoring after one gets up in the night? I also sometimes change beds if hubby is snoring, but I go right back to bed. I know I sleep more than five hours--is there any way to fix this? My settings are normal.

@Sammyken wrote:So, whenever I edit a sleep log it reverts it to the non-in depth version. So, I'm thinking that if I want to keep access to the theoretical sleep stages, I have to just take into consideration that it cannot account for my sleep latency as well as my sleep stages. Or maybe I'm doing something wrong? I suppose it doesn't really matter. I just felt like there should be a way to have both.It seems "minutes to fall asleep" was a casualty to the new sleep stage model. It also no longer specifies "restless".  Some people who'd rather know time restless over sleep stages, have disabled the HR monitoring to force the old sleep categories. For now, we have to choose one over the other.

Was it fixed?
Kind of a loaded question.  A week ago last Sunday I went for a 10-mile run during the afternoon and needed a nap within an hour of finishing (I passed out almost as soon as my head hit the pillow and didn't move for two hours).  There are other days were I'm totally wired after a long run and sleeping would be impossible for several hours afterword.
how many i know can say that a lot of factories changing our sleep , hours on sleep , from weather changes till simple stress.
My intention was to post this in the "Feature Suggestions" subforum.  I'm not sure how it ended up here, but I'd appreciate it if one of the moderators would move it over.
Movie critics could use this undocumented feature to help them write reviews. "I thought this two hour movie was good, but my tracker says it was sleep-inducing for one-and-a-half hours of it."

Appologies if this has already been asked.  I am curious what is the correct thing to do.  Sometimes I wake up at a god aweful time of 4AM, usually i go to the bathroom and cough and hack (yes I am a smoker to make things worse).  Sometimes I go back to sleep, sometimes I watch tv, and sometimes maybe doze off for 20 minutes. My question is, if I know I am up, but laying in bed watching tv and may sleep for 20 mins, should I stop sleep mode?  I guess the question really is, does sleep mode stop when my butt is out of the bed for good that day, or when I am awake reguardless of staying in bed. Thanks!
Thank you for your answer. I also believe that restless sleep and lack of deep sleep are related. I always fall asleep within 10-15 minutes after going to bed, so I have no trouble falling asleep. Neighter do I have any problems staying asleep since I very rearly wake up during the night. But the sleep quality is poor, and I never wake up rested. (Sorry about the lay-out in this answer. Shift didn't function)
2 thoughts:Do not use 'Begin Sleep Now' and 'I'm Awake'.You need to be getting consistent heart rate through the night; i.e. so not slipping around on wrist.

Hello everyone. Thanks for participating in the community forums. 
 
I'd like to let you know that Small variations in your estimated oxygen saturation levels are typical (source). Frequent big variations may indicate that you experience breathing disturbances during sleep. Breathing disturbances can lead to higher than expected variations in blood oxygen levels, which can indicate that your body is not getting enough oxygen while you sleep. If you frequently see big variations on your graph, consider talking to your doctor, particularly if you experience symptoms such as excessive tiredness, loud snoring, or gasping during sleep.
 
Other factors, including your arm position and certain physical characteristics, can affect your estimated oxygen variation readings, making them appear to be more variable. Make sure your Fitbit device is snug and secure on your wrist. For more information, see How do I wear my Fitbit device?
 
Note that your Fitbit device is not intended for medical purposes. Consult your health care professional about any questions or health issues you may have.
 
See you around.

Hello, hoping someone can help me out with my heartrate reading over the past few days.Since Monday (This is Thursday), my fitbit is showing my heartrate spiking after I wake up. At 5:30am each morning, the spike has been gradually increasing as well. It takes about 10-15 minutes to increase to the spike and get back to 'normal'.This morning it went from 66bpm to 195bpm and then back down. Monday it was up to about 147bpm, 174bpm on Tue and 187bpm on Wed. I don't think I've been doing anything different over the past few days. I have pretty much the same routine every morning. I'm never very awake when I get up so don't notice how I feel really. Haven't noticed anything irregular but my resting HR seems to have gone up to 73-77 since Monday, where it's usually 69-71. I would think it was a glitch if it didn't happen at the same time each day.
Thank you for the kind wish.

Hi @TimSylvesterNice work. Fitbit employees don't hang out in this part of the site much. I would recommend you make a proposal on this section, which Fitbit monitors for new ideas.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
The only suggestion I have is that if you know yourself how long it takes to fall asleep, you can adjust the start time of the sleep after the fact. I'm assuming you have a feeling for this, since you know the start time of the sleep is wrong.

My Charge3 is reporting conflicting information for sleep times.  For example, last night it reported 398 minutes from sleep start to finish.  However, it also reported 283 minutes asleep and 41 minutes awake.  That's a 74 minute discrepancy.  What am I not understanding?  Thanks.
My major sleep disorder began back in 2007 and ended my job as a long haul truck driver. I always go right to sleep but can only stay asleep, averagely, about an hour and a half to two hours most times. I have been telling the VA for more than 11 years that I have very intense dreams that cause major anxiety and frustration, so much it wakes me up. I have had three sleep studies done. Stopping breathing more than 5 times in an hour one is rated with sleep apnea. I tested 5.5 all three sleep tests. Barely, or marginal sleep apnea. I am so happy that a while back the fitbit app started the sleep cycle graphs. Now I have proof to show to my VA Mental Health Provider and my Sleep Doctor. The dreams are waking me up.Here are some examples of my sleep cycle graphs, taken with screenshot.March 19, 2018 http://prntscr.com/itkvqcMarch 14, 2018 http://prntscr.com/itkurhMarch 7, 2018 http://prntscr.com/itkv9m I impulsively get out of bed and on my feet when I wake up from a bad dream. (They are all bad.)I talk in my sleep. Sometimes propped up on on elbow talking for long lengths of time.I struggle, fight with the blankets or punch my pillow sometimes.I go straight into REM as soon as I go to sleep often.I have woken up sitting in a chair not remembering how or when I got there.I usually have three or four unique dreams a night, and can remember them, especially the very last one when I wake up in the morning.I live each day on a roller coaster of fatigue. I take naps because I have too. Can't go any longer. My therapist calls them power naps. I NEVER feel refreshed.About every two weeks I take naps all day long trying to catch up on my rest.When extremely fatigued I lose my concentration, problem solving abilities, and short term memory. Daily. Nap time when this happens. WebMD has a good web page covering types of sleep disorders.https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/sleep-disorders-symptoms-types My VA Doctors have tried every know medicine and sleep therapy they know of, more than once over the last few years. Nothing has changed. Nothing worked. Bottom line for me is that I have learned to live with it, and adjusted my life accordingly. It helps that I am 100% service connected total and pernament rated by the VA.

I have read this forum for about an hour now looking for the answer to why I am not able to share my sleep data with  my friend.  I have checked my private settings for sharing sleep data, and I actually changed it from "friends" to "public" in hopes that my friend and I can share our sleep data. On his page, I only see "30-day graph."  I do not see how he slept last night.  He cannot see how I slept last night. He purchased the Charge 2 yesterday.  I have the Alta HR.   Please do not ask me to search this forum for a solution because I have already spent 1 hour searching.  Can somebody please give me the answer? Again, our privacy settings are public for sleep.  Please help.  TIA! 🙂
I'm so disappointed with the "sleep" option. I thought it would actually pick up something on my wrist that determined when I am actually alseep and some information about the quality of that sleep. Instead it registers movement as being awake. False advertising. How can you track your sleep when you're required to turn the function on and off when awake.  For that, this is useless.  I also find the screen quality for the Premium option is awful.  Being 65 I keep my screen view set at 100% or more.  That isn't enough for Premium. And, if you try to increase the view, the text becomes a blur.  Very bad design or, perhaps a bad choice of software???  Not sure what is a label and what is information on the sleep area of the Premium screen. But, no matter, it doesn't actually track sleep!
I am sorry to hear that, Denise.  Sounds like it is manageable according to literature found online, at least.  Hopefully all goes well for you.
i have a fitbit inspire 2 and thank you for asking. i honestly think i need a workout buddy as i feel reluctant and lazy working out alone.
I did disconnect and reconnect. It is working now. I have a older model a Charge 2. I do have to recharge the battery a lot, 3 or 4 times during the day.  I was wanting to buy a newer model, but it seems like they are the same problems. I don't think buying a newer model with the same problems is worth it. I have always wore it on my non-dominant hand. I saw on QVC where I got this one the reviews are low for all the models there.

I have a Surge but am looking at getting a Blaze so that I can take advantage of the sleep stages. I use to use an app that would do it and you could set a ranged alarm to wake you up when you are in light sleep instead of deep or R.E.M. I woke way more refreshed, but had to sleep with the phone on the bed. Does sleep stages offer this type of alarm feature?
Hello Kesaiserris, I just got my FitBit in the mail today. I purchased it to help me monitor me sleep, for many of the same reasons you mention: bradycardia, low blood pressure, fatigue, ability to go into deep sleep quickly. You might consider that you have something called Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) - UARS sufferers are typically younger, leaner, and predominantly female. With UARS, there is something that is impeding on the airway, but instead of causing sleep apnea, it wakes us up. The result is non-refreshing sleep and all the issues associated with that. Here are some good articles to check out: http://www.elle.com/beauty/health-fitness/a44363/an-awaking-nightmare/ http://doctorstevenpark.com/sleep-apnea-basics/upper-airway-resistance-syndrome If this resonates with you, let me know. I'm currently going down this path and am convinced this is the source of my 17-year long fatigue and sh*ty sleep. I have found a number of really good (and bad) resources relating to UARS. Holly
I'm wondering why it's specified to wear on the non dominant hand?  I am surprised when I wear it on my non dominant hand how little it is saying I'm awake/restless.  I can tell my sleep quality is not as good as it is reporting and that I am more restless than it reports, but I think I do more action with my dominant hand.  For example, if I flip over onto my side or stomach and adjust the covers, typically it is with my dominant hand.  Or if my cat comes to sit on me, I move her away with my dominant hand.  Last night I swtiched and wore my fittie on the right hand (dominant) and I feel the reading I got was much more realistic for the sleep quality I feel I'm getting.  So I'm curious why the instruction to wear on the non dominant hand, doesnt make sense to me?
Recording had been normal all week, it was last night that gave no record.
I found this Fitbit that gives some information on this: "Sleep stages are traditionally measured in a lab using an electroencephalogram to detect brain activity along with other systems to monitor eye and muscle activity. While this method is the gold standard for measuring sleep stages (source), your device can estimate your sleep stages in a more comfortable, convenient way. Fitbit estimates your sleep stages using a combination of your movement and heart-rate patterns. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker or watch assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep. While you’re sleeping, your device tracks the beat-to-beat changes in your heart rate, known as heart rate variability (HRV), which fluctuate as you transition between light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep stages. When you sync your device in the morning, we use your movement and heart rate patterns to estimate your sleep cycles from the previous night." Taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htm

I'm not sure that there is anything that can be called a "normal night sleep". There are far too many variables in life that determine the quality of sleep from hormones to food, type of work you do (shift workers, on call) to the kind of day you have had. Many of my clients have been relieved in a way to start tracking their sleep as it helps them understand what may have contributed to a poor nights sleep. They have been able to start indentifying triggers or breaking habits (half a block of chocolate before bed!!). Some have taken their results to their Dr for further help. So far it's been a positive tool for change. There's  only one who doesn't like wearing it to bed as she finds it distracting and stops her from sleeping! Try reading up about REM cycles to help you understand the four stages of sleep.Good Luck!
On the first day of each month, your Fitbit Sleep Profile reveals which animal represents your most recent sleep habits. Fun fact - the animal with the highest proportion of women is the Tortoise, who tends to fall asleep more slowly and get a reasonable amount of sleep overall, while the Hedgehog has the highest proportion of men.
 What’s your sleep animal for the last month?
Funny you should mention this.  I did not buy the fitbit for STEP tracking, since I was already doing that on my iPhone.  I bought it specifically for SLEEP tracking because I bought a new bed and I wanted a quantitative way to see the difference.
I mean, yes. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder, not a mental illness. But dysfunctional neurotransmitters cause both mental illnesses and [some] neurological disorders. While autism is thought to be caused by an imbalance in the synaptic excitation and inhibition of neurons, depression is thought to be caused by low serotonin levels. ADHD is caused by low dopamine and/or norepinephrine levels (mine is dopamine). And narcolepsy is thought to be caused mainly by low hypocretin levels. So it can be both. Autism isn’t directly caused by GABA, but GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in our brains, so because autism has an imbalance in synaptic inhibition, GABA is thought to be a neurotransmitter that is affected. Hopefully that makes sense.. (sorry for all the medical jargon...)And I may be 24, but I’ve had narcolepsy symptoms for 12 years, which to me has been long enough to know it gets harder as I get older... I was diagnosed at 18 and had my license suspended until I was on treatment and could prove I could stay awake. This involved a sleep study and then a day study where I had to stay awake while sitting in bed in a very dark room for 50 minutes without anything to do but just sit there. I had to do that 4 times throughout the day. Having narcolepsy, you know how difficult it is to stay awake even in daylight. Somehow, I managed to stay awake each time... I did drift off a few times, but because I managed to snap out of it within 30 seconds each time, I passed. So my license is hard-earned.And while you can’t always overcome the physical aspects of a disability, you can overcome the mental obstacles that come with living with one. It’s a lot easier to live with narcolepsy if you focus on what you can do instead of what you can’t.
I have the same problem. No sleep stages are shown for the last 2 nights.
Before the Sleep Score was introduced, the Inspire showed the average hours and minutes of sleep for the week. Please bring this back, either instead of or as well as the average sleep score.
Hi, yes, my Fitbit 3 is syncing with with my phone.
@Tricky_Ricky5 Nice to see you around. First of all, my deepest condolences for the loss of your father. I'm sure you've been of great help for your mom during this months but thanks for sharing the information about this medication. Side effects are very strong.

Hi Feel free to restart your little friend: How do I restart my Fitbit Device? Hope it helps
The New tiles and info is awesome.. But when are you going to improve the sleep graphs and make the data a bit more insightful. I love my fitbit but the sleep tracking is a big part of why I track.. Looks like i will be looking for something new becasue once again you seem to forget t hose of us that track other data beside food and workouts 😞
I had the same issue - got the sleep stages feature yesterday (and was excited!!) and today back to the regular sleep tracking. Boooo. LOL
@SSundar   I don't think Fitbit looks at that to calculate your Restoration score.  The way I read it, it only looks at the percentage of time it was below your RHR.  Fitbit uses age related data for your breakdown of your deep, REM, and light sleep.  There is benchmark data for that.  I don't think the data you are seeking exists.  Other factors, like room temperature, can affect your sleeping heart rate. Most sleep experts recommend avoiding alcohol if you want better sleep.  How does alcohol affect sleep? It's worse than you think

I have typically been a good sleeper. There have been some nights I don't sleep well but it is usually for a reason. All of a sudden my Fitbit is telling me I am restless or awake for over half the night! I just wanted to ask if this has happened to anyone else. I'm trying to figure out if something is wrong with me vs the Fitbit. I have felt relatively refreshed the past two mornings of the unexplained changes.
Sometimes I get 8 hours sleep but still wake up feeling extremely tired. Any suggestions.
great idea
@blueeyes2 Hey there! You may want to check out this great article, there you'll find a lot of information about sleep and how you can understand the sleep graph. If you have the Premium Membership in the sleep report that this will give you, there you'll see if you're getting enough sleep or if you need to sleep more hours. Also, If you feel that you're not sleeping at all well, check out this thread Improve your Zzzzs

Hello everyone!I'm 22 years old, a pre med/psychology student in Portland, Oregon. My mom can even account for when I was very young, that I slept horrendously. My Fitbit says I am restless about 20x/night and I was waking up 2-3 times. It is set to sensitive, but I do always feel exhausted. I did start taking medicinal marijuana for sleep and that has helped a lot, which means I should also definitely see my doctor.My main question, I guess, is there anyone who used their Fitbit data as incentive to go to the doctor and did you get any treatment that significantly helped? As a premed student I figured I ought to tackle this before actual med school.
I just started using my fitbit- and have been monitoring sleep for the past 3 nights. According to the data I've been waking up any where between 21-22 times and 31 times per night according to the device. This doesn't make sense. I haven't been sleeping very well and have been getting up to use the bathroom 1-2 times per night and then falling asleep pretty quickly...however I've been waking up really tired.When do I start thinking that I might have a problem with sleep apnea? My husband usually falls right to sleep within 1-2 minutes- it takes me up to 20 minutes to fall asleep and I haven't had any real signs of sleep apnea. Not obese...don't snore, but lately have been waking up and still tired.
Great piece!  Thanks!
Not sure if you guys already know this. You can enroll sleep score beta now at https://www.fitbit.com/labs/sleep-score
I am using versa, but not getting oxygen level for sleep duration.how to know when it will be rolled to my device.
i have been , dealling with alot of sleep issues,always have but more now. I decided to put my flex in sensitivity mode instaed of normal and that was a huge differenc. i went form a 98% sleeper to a 50 % sleeper and my hpours of sleep dropped from 8-9hours to 4-5 hours. i really do not think this is accurate at all. Cause my sleeping really feels the same to me. the chart does not correspnd at all for the awake and sleep times, cause i look at the clock alot during the night But then again it has me awake for somteimes up to a !/2 hour and i do not remember that long of awakeness and i know for sure i was not movinf and swinging my arms. My big dogs awakes when ever i move alot in bed ?????? soooooooo, any ideas??
It's really going to depend on your doctor.  Some of them are looking at the tracking info for medical issues, others say they are not medical devices, and won't look at the data. My doctor looked at my data and help me get on a drug to lower my heart rate.  I've gotten off that drug now.  Amazing what losing 65 lbs does to the body! Good luck!

@chris_in_cal That's interesting you're having issues with your Inspire 2. It's actually pretty good especially when compared to an EEG and compared to other fitness trackers. Top right are the trackers that corelate well with an EEG sleep stages. I assume you've done the usual troubleshooting like restarting your Inspire 2 and making sure it's worn snug and above the wrist bone?
Yeah i have been doin that ....but you know we have restless periods in thenight which reduces the total sleep time... Hope fitbit comes u with anoption ...which will wake us up once we reach our goal.
Hello everyone! 😁
 
In my personal experience I didn't know that Yoga could help to manage symptoms of insomnia, so I gave it a try and for the past 2 weeks I've been able to fall asleep quicker, sleep for longer and reduce stress. 😴
 
Besides this, from a bedtime yoga routine we can have benefits such as Weight loss. I'd like to share the Yoga poses recommended from this Fitbit blog. 
 

 
For men sometimes it could be weird to do yoga but most women who regularly practice yoga realize that the men practicing yoga do so for the same reasons that women do. 
 
Feel free to share your experiences and talk about the benefits you've received 😊

I'd love that challenge. I slept 15 hours and 53 minutes last night. It was my personal best in the past 3 months lol
If I sleep 6 hours I need a nap. 7 hours is a minimum for me and if I sleep only 7 hours/night a few nights in a row I will need to catch up. Since I also believe sleep is the only natural state of happiness for mankind that works well for me 😄
@Jenjen118 wrote:Just to update: I put the fitbit on "sensitive" mode last night. Still 0 min to sleep..but now only a 67% sleep efficiency. It says I was awake/restless most of the night.

Hi!  It is a NEW (but now consistent) issue for me, except for me the APP is failing to show my sleep at the beginning of the night. If you have a decent idea of when you woke up and/or got out of bed in the morning, I suggest you try this.  [Write down the "correct" time shown for falling asleep, if you're like me and might forget.]  Delete the whole record of that sleep.  Add a new record with correct sleep wake times.  Possibly you will have the results I do: the entire record will show up with sleep stages, etc.; there initially will not be a sleep score, but one will show up later.  For me, it shows the time out of bed as AWAKE time in the middle of the recorded sleep, but I don't have premium, and it may work differently with premium.  If you are too far off with when you went to bed or woke up, it will not give you sleep stages.  This will only work if your device is recording the info.  Sometimes it is actually not recording for the various reasons that they like to describe (usually telling you to tighten the strap and swear it higher on your arm).
I take the sleep monitoring very seriously because i have sleep apnea and cannot tolerate my cpap machine any longer after 12 years of trying to conquer it - all it has done is given me severe insomnia. I am using the fit bit to monitor my disorder but every time i log on it tells me (next morning) that I have not logged on!!! I am infuriated by this because I know for sure that I did it properly because I am doing it exactly the same way as I did 3 weeks ago and it ran perfectly then.
On medication for it. I am sleeping a lot better, but still have lots of little red ticks on my graph so I’m not sure why. I feel better rested and have less wake times with medication. My iron levels were fine. The neurologist said it is a problem with gaba in the brain and it is essential to be medicated for it.
I'm about 5 weeks into my new fitness / eating routine. I definetly have more energy. But I can't say I'm having any trouble falling asleep. But the changes I've made are relatively mild. First, I'm eating healthier. For example, no egg mcmuffin and hash browns for breakfast. Either an egg white omlette or protien shake, or oatmeal. Lunches are a salad or similar. My dinners are still pretty bulky and my main meal of the day. I'm cooking for 3 kids (17, 19 and 21), and it's thier only chance for a home cooked meal. I've gotten more mindful of the fat/carb/protien balance and made adjustments. But still 50% of my calorie intake is dinner and evening snack. Not the best habit, but it's working. I'm going to the gym 4 times a week. 3 during the week in the evenings after dinner and once on the weekend. During the week is either an 'aggresive' 30m walk/run followed by 45m of weight traning or swimming. The weekend visit is 2 hours of walk/run and maybe some time on the cycle.  I do have a good nightime routine. I get home, change into pajamas. Drink a glass of water and chat with the kids if they are home, or snuggle with the dogs. No more chores at this point. Then I brush my teeth and go to bed.  An important point is no TV or 'screen time' (phone, computer or tablets) for 30m prior to bed. Reading the paper or a book is fine (epaper is okay, but no screens, the light affects me). Then when I crawl under the covers and turn out the light I'm usually asleep in <1m.  If I do wake up in the middle of the night, I'll get out of bed. I try to keep the lights off, but I'll go use the bathroom. Check on the kids and dogs. Peek outside to see if anyone is creeping around the neighborhood. Then crawl back into bed and I'm back out in under a couple of minutes. If not I'll get up again and sit with the dogs on the couch for 5 minutes or so.  I think the nighttime ritual and having the bed be a 'place for sleeping' is key to the body getting used to going from awake to asleep quickly.
Does anyone know why the sleep tracker shows your sleep pattern for the necxt day instead of the actual day that you are sleep?  This should be fixed.

I’m not happy at losing the Average Sleep data. The new sleep score is rubbish and pointless data. Get rid of it and bring back the Average Sleep.
I'm aware that weekly average sleep time is not part of premium. That is the problem. You bumped it deep into the menus in favor of Sleep Score, which is a meaningless, unactionable black box of a stat with marginally more utility for premium users. Let me say this again: You nerfed functionality by burying something a lot of people use and featuring something that is only (even a little bit) useful to premium users.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
I slept 30 minutes less than the night before but my sleep score was higher. What affects it? I slept with my mouthpiece last night but not the night before.
When I was younger I slept straight through the night and never seemed to move.  As an older adult (I am now 80), I never, ever have trouble falling asleep but do go through periods of time when I awaken in the middle of the night and have difficulty going back to sleep.  I just do not try to.  I get up, drink some water and sometimes eat something light.  If this does not work, I put on one my tapes from The Teaching Company.  It ALWAYs works.  Within a few sentences, I am asleep and do not awaken until my regular wake up time.  I do not know why this works.  Perhaps, I stay awake because too many thoughts are racing through my mind and listening to these tapes drown them out.
The next day it had sorted its self out and the data was correct.  I have no idea why it did it but it’s been fine since.😀
Hi!  This is my first time on the discussion board.  I recently purchased a FitBit One to help track sleep quality as I have Narcolepsy.  I do not know about your device, but with the One, you are to wear it on your non-dominate wrist.  The first night I used it, it should on the log that I must have been up walking around and wide awake.  I have it set to sensitive, so I'm not sure how accurate the readings are.  I am going to use a game camera at night to see if the awakenings and movements are correlating with the One.  My neuologist is curious to see the comparison from the One to the multiple sleep studies I have done.  Lookes like you are awake alot.  Maybe switching your Fitbit to your non-dominate hand would be worth trying. Good luck
Are you tapping it to start the sleep mode? if so...then you don't have to manually log it. Mine accidently started sleep mode one time about eight hours before going to bed and had about eight hours sleep recorded when I was active and I then turned it off when I went to sleep. Couldn't figure out what time I went to sleep(tapped it to go into sleep mode) that night so just logged manually about 1/2 hour when I figured I went to bed and tapped the fitbit. The log that night was not totally acurate but it gave a log. Hope this helps.
I agree @dsizzye, it's important to find the right mattress that works specifically for us and helps us to sleep better and be more comfortable in general. 
 
I've managed to sleep a lot better since I changed mattress last year, and I used to think it was't too important, but it certainly is. 😎

Rather than any sleeping pills, @TaniaRyl , I recommend meditation and Fitbit’s Relax app. I do this every night to clear my mind.Have you tried Relax on your Fitbit device? Which one do you have?
Mine has been doing the same thing.  I have had my Flex for over a year now and it didn't used to do it.  It just recently started doing it.  It will still tell me the total number of hours I slept on my dashboard, so it's not a big deal for me, but I have been curious as to why it is breaking it up like that.  The other night, mine was broken up into 4 different segments.
Hi @Laurennicole87 Moved this thread from the Flex to the Improve your Zzzs section since believe it will get more attention here.
I have Versa Lite, it needs 3 hours to show stages graph but tracks the nap time and adds it to the total.
Here are my tips for getting more REM sleep: 1. Keep a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends.2. Reduce blue light at night (use programs to do this on computer and phone).3. Get some sun in the morning.4. Avoid caffeine, especially in afternoon (not easy but really helps)5. No alcohol before bed (limit to 3 hours before bedtime).6. Regular exercise (obviously)7. Check your medications (pain killers, decongestants, allergy medicines can lower REM)8. Take magnesium supplment9. Choline nutrient helps REM (commonly found in eggs)10. Avoid THC/cannabis11. Noise pollution (counter with earplugs and/or white noise machine)12. Vitamin D (tends to lengthen sleep)13. Be creative (REM sleep is where we process mentally and creatively. Draw, write or journal)

@PerfectBlueIf you are using a wrist type Fitbit with the Workout option I use this if I want to record my sleeping HR down to about a heart beat every 2 seconds. I also have created a manual activity which I create through my phone through the Weekly Exercise tile by tapping the stopwatch.  The example below shows the Manual Activity method and the Sleep cycles..  It has picked up my bathroom breaks.  The number of steps in that sleep cycle were 138 and because the Fitbit wrist type are movement detectors you will always get some steps and these include my bathroom visits.  The scale at the bottom of the sleep graph is the actual time in the morning.. Whereas the HR graph is just the total time from 1am. @PerfectBlue wrote:Is there any way that I can compare my heartbeat to my sleep cycle. My heartbeat seems to be increasing to waking levels at times when I'm certain that I was asleep, and I sometimes wake up with steps on my step counter that shouldn't be there. So I'm either sleep walking or tossing and turning a lot, and I'd like to know whether this coincides with REM sleep or not.

same thing is happening with my fit bit, it just didn't log last nights at all....
im in BED at 12AM and up at 5AM to be to work at 7AM...5 hours sleep with intermittent periods waking up HELP..I need to get atleast 7:30 of sleep.. home by 5PM, School, Wife, Kids...etc IM EXHAUSTED  suggestions
That's true that all we eat and drink in the evening seriously influence your sleep. More than all it can damage not only your sleep, but the entire health. indeed better to avoid caffeine at least 4 hours before bed. I agree with the opinion that you need to relax before bed, getting in a sleepy mood. Especially for me is very important tactile feelings. I always ask my wife to make me massage before the sleep and then I wrap myself in the soft comforter that I ordered from http://www.mybedcomforter.com/. It is really very important to sleep cozy.
@SunsetRunner! You're either getting around the forums, or you stalk my profile. I think it's the former of the two 🙂Yeah, I actually walked to the bathroom in my house in my dream. I saw my Charge, grabbed if, and it turned on. I woke up after that...Huh. Dreams are weird.And @CallieM, certainly. Celebrating my 7.5k step goal every day, that is. 🙂Have a wonderful day, stay safe, and take care!
Tried swiping up, down and all around, lol. Nothing.
Hi Hajo71. As I mentioned, it works now maybe regardless what I did. However, to delete/reset the BR, enter the mydashboard online, go to view settings (top right), select settings, manage data. The list of activity will open, breathing rate is under health metrics. Click on the arrow on the right and delete the period you want. As I said it could have started working for completely different reason, but it doesn't hurt to give it a go
I've logged a couple weeks worth of sleep since I got my Charge2 and I've been impressed with how relatively accurate the sleep reports seem to be based on my recollection of each night... It's not perfect by any means but is pretty good. What would be nice is if I could add a little text annotation to each night where something happened to explain anomalies in the data ...  For example, I wear a dental appliance for sleep apnea.  Occasionally I adjust it and it would be nice to record my adjustment data with sleep data.. Or I'd like to keep track of caffeine/alcohol consumption in relation to sleep quality... It'd be nice not to have to maintain a separate spreadsheet for that not connected to my Fitbit Dashboard. Not sure if any Fitbit personnel read this stuff or if there's a better place for it.....

Um - I’m using my iPhone. Also using my MacAir on OS X El Capitan.Where is the tab?Thanks!
I think this would be a cool challenge. That being said, given the importance of sleep quality in addition to quantity, I feel as though to make it worthwhile it would be good to have that accounted for in the challenge.
Thanks!  I'm glad to know it doesn't make any difference with respect to sleep tracking.

hello, I have my charge 3 a few months and I bought it mainly for sleep tracking since I'm always tired ...the problem is a lot of the nights I get an inaccurate results:1. sometimes I go to sleep and the tracker records my sleep time an hour/2 hours later than the actual sleep time.2. sometimes I get up in the morning and some of the night time apears as gray and not being tracked ... what can be the reason for that?what should I do? if it can help I don't mind uploading my data somewhere ... thanks,Shay
I tried but only works part of the time and messes up everything else that was logged.

Thanks for your input @mary59 ! Just to clarify, it is true that if you wear your tracker to bed without activating sleep  mode, then manually log the hours you spent in bed on Fitbit.com, a sleep log will appear. If you want your log to appear when you sync, remember to activate sleep mode by following the instructions here. 

Emily | Community Moderator, FitbitAll that stepping got you exhausted? Improve Your Zzzs!
I got that insight as well today and I happen to totally disagree with it. Not that they are not related and that a good mattress and pillow will help you sleep better, but I disagree with the fact I am awake that often. I see those tiny blips of being awake of 30 seconds or 1 minute and I think the insight is given based on that for me. But to me they look like measuring noise. I understand your case is different as you do sleep restless and are not rested when waking up. Did you ever try staying in bed until you fall asleep again on days off? Do you have that luxury to try that every now and then? I find from my experience with anxiety that my sleep quality also heavily depends on how rested I am. When I am overly tired, I typically sleep worse and it can become that bad circle. Tired -> sleeping poorly because of that -> tired etc. When that happens I need a few days of rest, where I do very little, until I am rested again. Might be worth trying before having to spend money.

My Trendweight
What are typical sleep numbers for fitbit users (times awake, efficiency)?  I realize that the sleep tracking is not too high tech, but just trying to gauge what is typical for people using the force or flex technology.
Myself, 4 other people in my office, and two friends that live 500 miles away also got it.  That's 100 percent of the people I know with a fitbit. Appears to be at their end, and I hope they fix it.
Hi.  I've seen references to sleep benchmark  info as part of sleep insights.  Where does the data display?  I can't find/see the benchmark data.
You can manually put your Charge into sleep mode.  Just hold down the button on the side until it vibrates and a stopwatch symbol appears on the display.  I like to lie in bed and read, so it sometimes said I was sleeping earlier/later than I was.  I also track the "Time to Fall Asleep" data, which says "0 min" if I don't manually put it in sleep mode. Just turn on sleep mode when you turn off the lights, and stop it when you wake up.  It still might read some of your inactive time as sleep, but then those times will be listed as separate charts that are easy to delete (I'm not entirely sure about that last bit). but that's the workout function, not sleep mode
D'oh....my Inspire 2 has me thinking about better sleep and doing things differently...that's good. Last night I proudly went to bed at the right time and fell asleep.  I was in bed a full 8.5 hours mostly sleeping.  ( I chronically go to bed late) This morning my Inspire 2 cut off the first two hours of sleep.  It only shows about 6.5 hours in bed, starting after midnight. When it works, I believe it is about 80% accurate, and at other times it simply doesn't work.   Overall score is about 50% trust in the Inspire 2 to monitor my sleep.
My charge 3 hasn't been tracking my sleep for the last two nights either and it normally has no problem. I'll keep searching to see if this is a new known issue or just isolated.
Illustration: Case 1: I sleep from Monday 21:00 to Tuesday 05:00 and my sleep is sound. In this case, the fitbit versa 2 and app will tell me, that I slept 8 hours. fine. Case 2: I sleep from Monday 21:00 to 23:00, I wake up, am awake until Tuesday 01:00 and then sleep from Tuesday 01:00 to 05:00. In this case, the fitbit versa 2 and app will add the two hours between 21:00 to 23:00 with the previous day and say that I slept for four hours only.
This is my current sleep chart. What should be my perfect sleep chart? https://photos.app.goo.gl/dAdoUiYm69qUoEuB9
Interesting.  Mine may not be best comparison as I slept very poorly night before last as you can see in my timestamps on screen grabs below.  I can say this I slept like a rock both nights after my first and second covid vax shots (received second shot yesterday).
I typically go to bed around 10 PM and leave the bed (for the last time) around 7 AM. This is the duration of time I've been using to calculated TIB (Time in Bed). My typical sleep is punctuated with 3 pee breaks, the last of which is usually around 530 AM. By that time in the morning I'm usually fully rested but since it's still early in my work schedule, my habit has been to stay in bed and follow my breath (in pseudo meditation) or slip into a kind of hynogogic reverie, until around 7. So my TIB INCLUDES this last hour of "wakeful rest" even though I know I am for the most part awake only lying prone in bed instead of walking about or seated. To my thinking this last hour should not affect the apps' calculation of my total minutes in REM or DEEP sleep. Nonetheless, it does so, in a dramatic way. I've attached 2 sets of images to make my point. These show how the app calculated today's stages of sleep. (This pattern of discrepancies can be demonstrated for any other day's data too.) The 1st set of images shows TIB until 7:15 AM. Time Asleep is given as 7 hr 59 min. The calculations in this first set of data INCLUDED an hour and a half of meditation/reverie I did this morning while in bed. Notably, REM time is given as 44 minutes, DEEP sleep as 65 minutes. If you look at the image, you'll see there were ZERO spikes in the graph showing DEEP sleep during that last hour and a half. Also, the total REM shown is about 8 minutes worth for the hour and a half.  For the 2nd set of images I edited out the final hour and a half of TIB during which I was mostly awake. The amount of REM sleep calculated for the 2nd set is dramatically different. Now I supposedly had 83 minutes of REM which is almost double the 44 minutes when I included MORE TIB. That's absurd. Given less data and less time for sleep how can I have double as much REM time? If you compare the 2 sets of images for the stages it makes no sense for there to have been double the REM time. Also, the minutes in DEEP sleep seem to have changed inversely to the REM numbers. While the app showed double the REM minutes (83 v. 44) when I set the wake up time to 5:48 instead of 7:15, the DEEP sleep time moved in the opposite direction (from 65 minutes down to 42). Why are there such discrepancies in the apps calculations based on length of TIB when during the last hour and a half in bed the images showed nearly no REM or DEEP activity? So if one removed that period with almost no REM/DEEP activity why would the recalculated data be so different from the full TIB calculation?
I'm right there with you. Most nights I wake up 0 times, max 3 times for a total of a couple minutes. I'm restless maybe 8-12 times which is usually because I'm too warm and throwing off covers or too cold and pulling them back on. As my husband says, I have never had a problem sleeping. I can certainly understand if people are sleep deprived if they are waking up several times a night.
Yep, Zollistar's advice is good. Sleep apneoa is a condition that you don't know you have because those affected believe that they sleep like a log. The problem is your body does not get enough oxygen during the night and can not recharge itself. This can only be diagnosed via a professional sleep study although the SPO2 sensor on the ionic is hopefully going to make the many undiagnosed aware that they may have this condition and to seek medical advice. You don't need more sleep, you need the minimum required quality sleep, which is between 1.5 - 2 hours a night.
I just always wear my charge on my wrist like where I used to wear a watch.  I wear it like this when I work out and when I sleep and work.  Hope this answers your question.  I have not found  my charge to act up when I sleep.  I did have to initially change my sleep settings to normal (changing it from sensitive) when I set it up.  You might want to look at your sleep settings and see if you can find the right setting for you.
Wow did you just copy that response from the more info tab in the app
Hello Lily,I recently bought a FitBit Charge 2 and I too have been doing HIIT Classes, running, and Spinning, for about 6 years. I also have been using a chest strap for the same amount of time. After a while you can figure what you'll burn during an intense workout.  For example I always know 1 hour of HIIT will give me from 700-850 calories depending on intensity.   So when I got my fitbit I used it with my chest strap for the first week and noticed my final total "Calories Burned" was off. But it tracked my average HR and Peak pretty good.  My brother also bought the same Fitbit and I noticed his numbers were very close to my chest strap, but not my fitbit. (we workout together) I asked him what he did different and he said "nothing, but I do weigh more than you."  And then it hit me. What if FitBit's numbers were off because it's not properly calculating my calories burned based on my BMR formula?  So i decided to do a test: for the next week I increased my profile's weight about 40lbs to match my brother's weight. (I weigh 165, he weighs 200lbs).   And to my surprise the FitBit was matching up to my Chest Strap.  Now mind you, my chest strap is calculating my proper calories based on my height and Proper weight of 165lbs. And both are coming out very very close. Many people might say by putting the wrong weight will affect the diet portion of the app, but I personally don't use that so it works for me. All I care about is total calories burned and daily HR and Sleep. And in the end if it's close to the chest strap then it must be right because the chest strap is the most accurate.  I will provide a few pics for you to see and compare. each pic has my Chest Strap results on Top and the Fitbit on bottom.  The one below:my watch was loose and was at "0" for about 3 minutes until I tightened it.
I have my 2nd Sleep Study coming up on March 26th and I’m nervous about being off my meds two weeks prior. My sleep specialist thinks that my original diagnoses of Idiopathic Hypersomnia was just the beginning stages of what now looks like early Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. I got the Fitbit Versa a few days ago and my sleep just seems too ‘normal’ haha! I hope they let me wear mine during the sleep test so I can also contribute to this comparison. I am wondering if I’d be better off tracking sleep with a non wearable device. It’s the only real reason why I got this, but I do love it so far.
So I set my average sleep time from 10 p to 6 a. My husband and I were driving cross country and between 10 and 6 I actually slept from 2-4 a but my sense gave me the highest sleep score yet! 8 HR 25 minutes! Over an hour of deep sleep and my highest percentage in REM. What's up fitbit?
Can anyone send me a sample sleep report? I am thinking about going premium but would like to see more of what the report includes. Pictures on site is just too small.  Thanks!
I have also been shocked to see how restless my sleep is. I also have 40 to 50 restless restless periods each night with 3to 4 wake ups per night. I wish I knew what this means or what do to improve my sleep.
Hi @BriAnne5, I had that happen to me during the sleep update. It fixed itself after a couple of times of using the old way of tracking. I don't think there's anything you can or have to do on your end. One thing to note is that naps and sleep less than 3 hours are still tracked in the old method, probably because there's no REM during such a short sleep.

Hi @Mstrish1 On the Fitbit App, scroll down to the number of hours slept, then tap. The next screen will show your sleep score. On the top right side there is a settings symbol, tap on this symbol. Part way down the screen, you will see bedtime and wake up time. You can change the times by tapping on each one of them. Please let me know if this helps.

Hi all, for the last 3 weeks for seemingly absolutely no reason, I keep waking up in the night. Sometimes at least twice and often more times than this. I just changed jobs (from a horrible one which was making me stressed - to a lovely new one....so don't think this is the cause). I don't lie awake during these awake periods, I tend to just wake then fall back to sleep within 10 minutes or so, the exception being this morning when I woke at 4:20am and simply couldn't get back to sleep. I make sure I have no caffeine in the second half of the day, am always hydrated and don't feel particularly stressed. The broken sleep is now really starting to get to me. Does anyone have any suggestions/ tips as to how I can sleep through the night? Getting to sleep in the first place isn't an issue either. Any help would be appreciated! 🙂
Granted I was one of the first to complain, but now that I found the hiddenstuff (from the monthly summary graph, scroll down) it is not sobad...however, I DO prefer the old format. The major thing that is missingfor me is on the sleep/awake graph, it does not tell you what time theawake/restless times are. However, the percent sleep which is what I missedoriginally, I have figured out a way to calculate that myself. Determinethe total time in bed and then subtract the total time awake/sleep (that isgiven) from total time in bed. Then divide that (time asleep) by the totaltime in bed for the percent. Again I so prefer the old format also! GoodLuck.gailfaith
So far moving it to the other arm at night seems to be working. I have frozen shoulder on one side and somehow that makes the fitbit slide down until it cuts the circulation off.

I think that Fitbit is really helpful because when your asleep it tracks you on how well your sleeping and I like the idea that it knows that information then when you wake up you open the app and I shows all the information you need
I had surgeyr a bit ago, and I still nap a lot during the day.  Every morning I show only about 5 hrs sleep, but I think that it might show a better estimate of my sleep if I left it on sleep mode all day.  My question is, will it also record my steps If I leave it on sleep mode?
The benchmark data is great, but I can't help wondering whether it's just an average of data collected by Fitbit users, or a recommended amount of sleep by sleep type?  I can't imagine being awake 1/5  of the night is healthy for any age or gender.

So were you dreaming about running from zombees?
Hi everyone, I have been working on improving my sleep. I have been using the fitbit and working toward increasing my sleep to 7 hours per night. I had a question. Which do you prefer? Which do you feel is more accurate? And why does "logging" sleep not list the sleep stages? I felt the automatic tracking under estimates my sleep. I do not believe I'm awake that long in the night, but the automatic tracking informs me of the sleep stages, which I find interesting and useful. I have started the logging, and I feel it is a more accurate estimate of my sleep. I just started it this week. Thank you in advance!

I am really glad to have found this link. I just bought myself a fitbit charge 3 about a week and a half ago. I wear this device while sleeping and my sleeps have been terrible every night since. I am interested in tracking not only my activity but my sleep patterns and how they relate to my heart rate. I normally will have one bad, that is restless, night of sleep per week, at the most. Every night is really bad ever since, with little to no deep sleep and waking up several time over the night. I will go to bed tonite not wearing my fitbit to see what happens regarding my sleep, though there will be no data.
Thanks for that!
Did anyone ever get an answer here? This glitch still happens to me!
Don't touch caffeine or cola lol. I'm not trying to be awkward here btweither lol but I think I have tried all the bog standard things.When I wake at 11 or so I will usually fall over again fairly quickly, the1 am thing can be more troublesome, sometimes I will fall over fairlyquickly other times I just lay there and meditate, focusing on the breath,I'll usually slip and in out of sleep, as I say I do thing until I can getup, I get up at 5am anyway for work.
The fitbit products can't determine if you are sleeping or watching TV. The software needs a switch turned on - the double tap. The question was why can it be automatic? One user expressed his satification with having to manualy enter into sleep mode. I disagee with his assessment that its easy to use, it is most definitely NOT. As another pointed out there is lack of input data to ensure accuracy. The Basis tracker has heart rate monitoring along with perspiration sensors and can determine when the wearer is sleeping. The answer? The Force would need more sensors to do it automatically  i.e. Higher Price.
@SunsetRunner   You might not be happy with the results.  If a sleep segment is less than three hours, you don't get sleep score generated for that segment, because Fitbit generates only sleep patterns for a segment that short.  You might wind up with an awful sleep score for one segment of your sleep. If you aren't familiar with how Fitbit calculates your sleep score, you might want to check out this Help article.  Your time asleep counts for 50% of your sleep score.  The amount of time in Deep and REM sleep counts for 25%.  Your sleeping heart rate counts for 25%.  This period of awake time just might not place as big a role in your sleep score as you think it does.  There is something else you need to be aware of.  There is a sleep stage called transitional sleep, that stage between being awake and asleep.  Fitbit might register this as light sleep, even though you think you are awake. Another thing to keep in mind.  Sleep is an EEG diagnosis.  Fitbit can't measure your EEG, but uses motion, heart rate variability, and breathing rate to make this estimate. I like to keep it simple.

I've added sleep log and it's not putting on the right day. Example last did not record for some reason, so I added the log, it's showing up for today. Nothing shows for Monday night!
The most I had was 1 hr 52 minutes.
I found that doing short, "fat burn" heart zone slow cardio on my elliptical with higher resistance has helped with sleep quality and quantity. I've also experimented with single-set heavier resistance band training (i.e. deadlifts). I've practiced deep diaphragmatic nasal breathing during both, which has been shown to improve respiration during sleep (with just 60 seconds worth) while at the same time stimulating the vagal nerve to prime parasympathetic response  2-4 hours before bed.  Additionally, the increase in body temperature from minimal exercise just hours before sleep may help via a steeper pre-sleep body temperature drop, in a cool sleep space. But it's probably important to be very careful not to overdue late afternoon or early evening exercise to avoid large spikes in cortisol and metabolic rev-up that have been shown to be sleep-disrupting.
Remember that fitbit makes an intelligent guess of your sleep from movement and heart rate so may not be very accurate, just a sort of about there-ish measurement. Going to bed a bit earlier to get enough sleep is probably the most important thing. someone will come up with an easy way to monitor brain waves in the next decade or so.

Hello @Beachgirl8185, welcome to the community forums! 
 
If you don’t see the sleep tile, please do the following:
 
1. Tap Settings at the bottom of Fitbit Today.
2. Make sure the sleep tile is turned on.
3. If you still don't see it, please restart your Versa 2, disable some stats.
4. Sync your Fitbit device 2-3 times and then look for the Sleep stat. Note that you can add up to 7 stats. 
 
Hope this helps!

From the Charge HR page:"How does Charge HR track my sleep?The motion sensor on your Charge HR analyzes your movement patterns to determine whether you're asleep, restless, or awake. We use this data to calculate your sleep efficiency." If you're entering the data manually, you're overriding the data it's collecting. From the Charge HR manual: "Tracking sleep - Your Charge HR automatically tracks the hours you sleep and your movement during the night to help you understand your sleep quality. You don’t need to press any 10 buttons or otherwise enter a 'sleep mode' to begin tracking sleep. Simply wear your Charge HR to bed. To see your sleep data, sync your tracker and then view the Fitbit.com dashboard or mobile app. On the dashboard you can look at the sleep tiles or go to Log > Sleep. In the mobile app, tap your sleep tile. "

At Fitbit Developers that would be wonderful instead of my husband waking me up to tell me to turn off the app!!! Please Fitbit!! Thank you @Docwints for the wonderful suggestion !!!!
I start it the moment I think I might not remember later
I'll check out the links as well.  Only had the One (upgraded from the Zip) about a week so while I find the info sorta interesting to look at, I'm not sure how to benefit from it. It's interesting to me how much it varies day to day, from say 25x restless one night to 1 x the following night.  If you don't know what caused you to be restless etc??  What does one do with the info? AND, I think hubby is more restless then me; but he's not of the opinion wearing one makes any sense.  I thought he might like to try mine before purchasing one; but wondered if that works?  Do you have to change settings somehow to allow someone else to use your One...is our weight, height, age, and sex info calculating into the sleep or is that separate for the stepping etc.??

I had the same problem but I took the advice of someone else here and bought rubber O Rings to hold the band on.  Seems ridiculous that we have to do this but Fitbit doesn't seem to have figured out how to deal with this problem.  The O rings help.
Did you ever get checked for sleep apnea? I’m curious because my graph does the same thing.
I have a charge 2 and sleeping with it bothers my wrist, it is a bit to rigid and the pebble is thick which causes slight numbness and pain.( I toss and turn when I sleep). I would like a thinner tracker that still gets my sleep stages recorded, not just hours slept. Thank you for taking the time to help me 🙂@MarciM wrote:Hi @LisaMC317 Can you share a bit more information about what is uncomfortable? Hard to make a recommendation without understanding the issue.

Melissa | Community Moderator, FitbitHow are you fitbitting with your (pet) best friend? Show us!
Hi everyone I've only had my fitbit about a week or so, and my sleep settings have been set to normal during this time.  I have been using the fitbit to track my steps and sleeping patterns, and it seems to count me as sleeping when I'm watching tv at night or lying in the bed in the morning, but not necessarily moving etc, because basically I'm trying to fall back asleep.  For instance last night I went to bed late because I was watching a tv series, from 9:30pm-11pm. Fitbit had me recorded as being in the light stage of sleep during this timeframe.  I often wake early in the morning, or in the middle of the night, but I intentionally stay still and breathe slowly and deeply, trying to get myself back to sleep again. On these occasions, the fitbit keeps recording me as being in the light stage of sleep.Is there a way to get the fitbit to record my sleep more accurately?
I can't help directly as I don't track my sleep but hopefully this help file from fitbit will be of some use: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1876/
I think I am equally slow in replying to your posts to be honest @MDadourian.. Its good that we can be patient in waiting for each other to reply. I'm pleased.. Although at the moment, I haven't done a huge amount of exercise. I have done a few runs during the Easter break I guess but did need to rest my legs I think. I must look again on your website, I've just found your episodes too. I haven't had a huge amount of time to look at anything fitness orientated other than what comes on my news feed on facebook & the start in reading The art to running Faster, (think I have mentioned that book in a previous post). During a long run, my arches were a bit awkward, I was running with a friend, entirely off road and not even particularly fast.. So it annoyed me that my arches continued to cause me grief. I'll visit the store I got my trainers from and see what they suggest. I guess at the moment, I am still getting my running confidence back & it was interesting reading shorter but more frequent runs are better than long distance. Whatever I read I'll still maintain a long run for scenic purposes. Short runs are not particularly interesting for me & I've realised it takes a while for my breathing to settle down. The friend I was running with thought my inhalation was rather quick. Bring on yoga classes- when I have time.   Yeah good point re listening to your body, however with me it can often/usually turn into laziness & lack of motivation. I've not reached that yet I don't think, I ought to workout soon though so that I avoid that issue. Once I've hit the laziness stage, its hard to get out of it.  Yeah 🙂 I cannot wait till Colour me Rad, its not till June though. Still waiting on Electric Run dates. I'm certainly not ready for a Half Marathon, but I do plan to tick it off my list at some point. Cheers Michael! How you doing? Yep I will do... leg muscles still quite tight & my decent trainers are elsewhere (unfortunately at the moment), so will hit the gym soon with the vibrams and break them in some more.   I've had a great Easter thanks, hope all is good with you. I am looking forward to getting my exercise routine back, although it will all get interupted again with the build up to my brothers wedding. Looking forward to my bro's wedding though. 🙂

Hi Alex, I found this on PubMed.  According to this study conclusion published in the Brazilian Journal of Psychiatry in the Jan/Feb 2019 edition:"Moderate-intensity resistance exercise and stretching led to similar improvements in objective and subjective sleep in patients with chronic insomnia."
Not that I am aware you can't go back.  😕
Wow, I find your sleep log kind of disturbing. I thought that I was having poor sleep! I sleep in a bed with my hubby and 5 month old baby. I do not sleep well. I am up a lot and always uncomfortable, but my log is not nearly as bad as yours. I wear a flex, also on sensitive.I would really consider seeing a doctor again if I were you. Sounds like something is going on.. if not apnea, do you drink a lot of coffee or have alcohol before bed? Are there options you can look into for your pain? Physiotherapy? Massage? Yoga?

Under personal information there is a sleep sensitivity setting:   normal or sensitive
Took me decades, sleep disorder medications etc. to learn that I need to wake in the night for 2-4 hours and then go back to sleep. I have also discovered that before the invention of artifical lighting, this was the way people slept. The second sleep is what later became the term "beauty sleep". Check this info from Virginia Tech: http://www.history.vt.edu/Ekirch/sleepcommentary.html   This means I need about an 11 hour block. So If you want me up at 7:00am I need to be in bed at 8:00pm. I may like the idea of staying up late, but hundreds of thousands of years of evolution could care less that the tonight show is on and I want to wreck a natural pattern of rest by trying to sleep in one block of 8 hours. No other animal on earth sleeps in a single block within 24 hours, why do we think humans should?   Blue light will cause your body to think it is in daylight, so I use blue blocking glasses when I do awake in the night and I keep it mellow, just read, no TV, no computer etc.  I have gone from similar sleep numbers to you (about 3 hours a night) to sleeping more like 9. Away wen't the ADHD diagnosis, insomnia diagnosis etc. I also no longer drink caffeine, a drug that apparently 85% of Americans are dependent on. Hope that helps. Your sleep hours are truly horrible and I empathyize, but what I stated worked for me, and the fitbit tracks my 8-9 hours a night of sleep.
Has happened to me as well. At the end of the day, reduce the steps by around 5%-8% to gauge the actual count. Also, make sure that you have the dormant hand setting set which you can do through the Fitbit app.
I am trying to entire sleep time manually.  I entire the time into bed and the time out and enter, but it keeps asking me to enter the time out of bed.
change your sleep sensitivity. it might be on normal just now
Have others had problems with sleep records not showing detailed information once you've synced the next day?  Because I have & I have rung Fitbit each time it's happened since November.  As it happened yesterday morning also, but I deleted it off and re-synced it again thinking it might re-load the data for the day before but unfortunately it didn't, so have lost the basic details like those attached for yesterday altogether. When I rang Fitbit I wasn't told it was a problem others have had, until ringing them today - who told me 'Fitbit are aware of there being a problem with some users just getting basic information, and trying to work on a fix for it'. If you have short naps I'm aware it just shows basic details if it's under 3 hours or whatever the figure is.  Just I've got a Neurological Sleep Disorder P.L.M.D. so my sleep records are vitally important to show to my Neurologist    Have any other people had this same issue at all & how frequently is it happening - when you get a full night's sleep (if at all)?
@lian Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm very glad to hear that Fitbit has helped you with this.
 
This is the purpose of the new updates, to help users the more Fitbit can. How are you right now?
 
Hopefully, these improvements that Fitbit is doing will help other users as well. Also, the new ones that will come, I guess! The future is friendly!

Hello! I had the same problem and it all worked out when I got another girlfriend😂 Generally, the reason for insomnia is very commonplace it is a sign of fear, anxiety. As I read in one book about psychosomatic: the only way to sleep well and soundly is to learn to trust: trust yourself, people, life.
Lucky!  Apparently I am suffering from horrible sleep patterns!  I was at a 54% sleep efficiency last night.  I was in bed for 8 hrs 33 mins but apparenty only "slept" for 4 hrs 16 mins!!! We'll see what happens moving forward!  Guess now I know why I am so dang tired during the day!

So deep sleep is great, but you don't have to be in it for an extended period of time to feel rested in the morning. There is also rem sleep and even restless sleep (dreams) can be enough to make you not tired. If you are exhausted in the morning - more than normal I am so tired stuff we go through as adults- then I would try meditation, reading a happy book before bed, or the natural aids mentioned by Cathy. Sleep well..

I do not agree that this is a BETTER option. I used the old average system to be able to calculate how much extra I needed to sleep on the weekends. The system that is left now shows 7 days intervals in a minimum. So the last weekend is always included when I check it within the week.
I contacted Fitbit Chat about the Breathing Rate as the only feature not showing any data on my week-old Fitbit Sense.  They said that there is a Background Firmware Download that will take at least two days to finish.  Once that is done, our Fitbit app is supposed to notify us of an available firmware update that we need to install in the app.  Hopefully, this will fix the Breathing Rate and other bugs.😷
Hi @Xostas - It might be worth tracking what you are eating ... how close to bedtime ... and any alcohol. I know from experience that all can affect my sleep. Track it for a week, looking at your sleep reports, and you may find an explanation. Besides tracking food, I also track exercise and pain meds, comparing them to my sleep reports. This has helped me (and my docs) determine the right balance for a good night’s sleep. These Fitbit devices give us a lot of tools!
If you have ever slept more than once in a day in your life, forget about using Fitbit to accurately track your sleep.  No, you are not confused and there is nothing wrong with your eyes.  Apparently the developers at Fitbit are unable to program any sort of function to add your total sleep for the entire day.  In the meantime they are stealing money from us users who purchased these products and even wasted $50 for the "premium" service so we could track our sleep and get accurate sleep reports.Nope.  Fitbit only tracks the LONGEST sleep record.  Took a 2 hour nap? Doesn't count!
Woke up in the middle of the night, and went back to sleep?  Doesn't count!
Studies have already suggested that a monophasic 8-hour sleep schedule is a myth.  This sleep pattern has only recently been adopted with the industrial age, but yet a 1/3rd of Americans are unable to adopt this type of pattern.  Historically, a biphasic sleep schedule was more common.  They would call it "1st sleep" and "2nd sleep," where people would normally be awake for a few hours in between... Now doesn't it make sense why sometimes you wake up mid-sleep only to fall asleep a little while later?
Check out these links for more info:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16964783
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/05/8-hour-sleep-myth_n_1322376.html
 
Also, let's not leave out the polyphasic sleep enthusiasts...
 
It's frustrating just how little Fitbit understands their target market.  For those of us who like to track everything, we are on top of stuff like the aforementioned links...  Why isn't the company who is SELLING this on top of these things?
 
I am very upset that the people at Fitbit would go this long without noticing such a simple thing and have the audacity to sell this product like this while misleading their customers.  EXAMPLE:Today I took two "power naps" as seen on my log.  One for 17 mins and one for 20 mins:

In the dashboard, it only shows the longest sleep record, which is 20 mins.  This is not accurate:

 
The sleep report you pay $50 to see also has this erroneous information, it only shows one sleep record per day.  

 
It gets better.  Guess what, this is how the $50 report portrays the information to you, as a graph showing how you rank with everyone else.  If you actually add it up and average it out, it DOES NOT take into account this "missing sleep time."  It only takes into account the longest sleep record.  So if one day you slept 5 hours, then you slept another 4 hours, those 4 hours don't count and are not added to your average or to the daily totals, and if you do this more than once in a week, you can already see how your total sleep will be under-reported.
This is EXTREMELY misleading.  In my case, I actually showed these graphs to my doctor and was prescribed medicine based on it.  Can you imagine the consequences?

My sleep efficient is about the same as yours, I moved about 1000 steps and over 320 cal on 7 hourslast night.  I am 130lb, 5'7".@SunsetRunner wrote:I'm curious as to how many cals restless sleepers burn from midnight to when they wake up - for me it's about 450 cals (get up at 8am) Would also be good to know solid sleeper's results for comparing! I'm 6ft, female and 34. Not overweight. My sleep efficiency on sensitive is between 27% and 35%. Thanks to anyone who posts 🙂
Hello Fitbit community, Lets get straight to the point. When I manually calculate the sleep efficiency score using my data retrieved from the Web API using this formula, I do not end up with the same values. For instance:timeAsleep - 433timeInBed - 510minutesToFallAsleep - 0 That would make: 433 / (510 - 0) = 0.849. However, the efficiency score is 94 for that day. How does that work?  Thank you, and have a good day, Olle
Good tips there @Bobcat84 ! I might use some of these myself. Thank you for sharing. Have a nice day.     TW
My fitbit flex 2 has the same problem.  On my most sleepless nights, when I'd really like to see the record, it stops recording if I get up to pee.  It's really annoying.  @Winter- wrote:Just got the device.  I woke up at 3 for a pee and it did not record the rest of the night.  I am unclear why this is marked as solved.   How do we actually solve this problem everyone is having?   Thanks.
If I fall asleep in my chair for 2 hours then go to bed it doesn’t count the 2 hours I slept in the chair.

@genericbrandhmn I never had a problem with my Charge 5 tracking my sleep. I agree with @SunsetRunner that it would be useful to contact Support to get help with this.

When you say your not getting a graph. Do you have a blank graph for EOV?
I'm not paying any yearly fees for graphs.. what I got works for me.  I think that's the "Premium" option, where you get more features.  I don't personally think it's worth it myself.  I think the sleep function works well enough for me, to see that I'm getting sound sleep or restless sleep is ok with me. I'm not concerned with how accurate that is, just that it's showing patterns. I can tell when I haven't done many steps, I seem to be more restless. When I have exercised and done 10k steps a day, I pass out and sleep hard, don't move much.. Utlimately, whatever works best for you, and what you're willing to pay (or not) is your decision. There may be some who think the $50/yr fee is a good thing and don't mind. To me it's an option, not a requirement.  Go with whatever works for you and just keep being active, regardless... you'll feel better and sleep better for sure!
I have the same issue. Really disappointed too. But since last tuesday i noticed that my heart rate tracker is not working well. Sometimes it shows a too High heart rate, even when i am restless. Maybe it has a relation with the sleep details!
Seems easy to me. Fitbit has a database for logging food (calories, sodium etc.) Why don't they integrate a caffeine intake. That way people can correlate caffeine and sleep. Anyone else wonder about this?
I've been struggling with the same issue lately. I have been having a hard time getting out of bed and I get so sleepy by early evening that I just don't feel like doing anything. Most of my sleep issues are associated with stress and bad diet. We had to fire somebody at work and I am picking up most of his hours so some days I work 10 hours, getting home at 8pm. This week I also ate very poorly, I had fast food for a several meals and my body was so upset. I'm determined to eat better this week but my stomach still hurts from all the junk I've had recently. I also haven't been exercising as much. All of this makes me feel lethargic and when I do go to sleep I don't wake up feeling rested.  Is there anything changing in your diet, stress or activity levels?
REM Sleep isn't very restorative, so as far as your energy levels, having less REM sleep is probably a good thing. In fact, people who have narcolepsy suffer from an excess of REM sleep and as a result they never feel refreshed-- even after sleeping for many hours. Besides stimulants, patients with narcolepsy are often prescribed SSRIs because they suppress REM sleep.
Hi Kirsten, Your post was interesting to me. I am 52 years old and I can also sleep any time and for multiple hours at a time. This has been my norm for years. I too wake up and wait a few minutes and I resume my get up and go! I take Lexapro and it made me wonder if that might be my dilema too. I am very energetic during the day and I conk out at night. People have commented, as long as I can remember, about how much I sleep. I am a nurse at a very busy hospital andwork twelve hour shifts 3 x week. Any ideas? Any thoughts would be glad appreciated. Thanks, Shelbeegirl

Let's say I go lay down in bed at 9pm (I read for 30 minutes), I turn lights off at 9:30. I would fell asleep soon after that (10pm) and I would wake up the next morning at 5:30am. so that would give me 7 1/2 hours of sleep. But why does my fitbit charge say that I slept 8 1/2 hours? I hope this makes sense. TIA@Kimgeloneck I have the same issue as @JohnRi and others have reported in Yoga the same issue. In your case for the sleep record you can edit the start time and correct the sleep information. If it happens while watching TV and something like Yoga you can edit the sleep record and change it to an activity record or delete it totally.

Perhaps, some did not understand how I used the journaling feature.  I encourage you to read my post again. I never indicated that I posted in my journal in the evening, I would post in the morning AFTER exercise, to indicate pain levels while doing that as well.  I used it as a tool to manage my pain!  If you have ever experienced daily pain, you will try everything holistically possible to help yourself.  I never took the medication they gave me and thank goodness as I did not have what they diagnosed me with. I do not keep another type of journal, if I did, I agree that writing in a journal is better.  Again, I used it for more documental journaling.I have yet to find a journal that I like to document my response to medications, exercise and other daily life events that effect my illness.  My new physician was very pleased that I kept the Fitbit journal as it provided him with usful information.If there is anyone else who uses a journal for documenting purposes, and uses an electronic source, please post it and I would like to try it.  Thank you!
My sleep study shows I wake up 16 times an hour.  Normal is 7 in 8hrs.  They said my sleep apnea is light to moderate. I think the Cppap machine can help hide other problems.  The stress we put ourselves under daily is the core problem,  adrenal fatigue, sleep issues and then fatigue is the chain of events.   These events then start effecting your organs.  Serious as a heart attack the adrenal fatigue will start you body shutting down.  I hope my last posts help some people out.  It took me 10 years of high stress to start feeling like crap and 1.5 years to start fixing it.
Would be nice to have this function indeed. REM sleep is detectable by heart rate as shown in several studies. There has been an algortihm developed for this kind of detection (just google it) via heart rate. I'm speculating here for the the reason this has not been implemented. The HR detection is just not accurate enough to get a reliable detection for all of FitBit's consumers.
Great summary!
Yes, it's normal for me too, I have similar sleeping patterns.
I'm fairly confident saying that your breath and heart aren't stopping for ten minute periods. This happens to me on occasion, for about ten minute periods also. What I've gathered is that sometime during the night I'm tossing or turning in a way that causes the tracker sensor to temporarily lose signal contact with my wrist, and that's causing the drop-out. In general, if I feel rested and there's not huge area of "restless" in the sleep data, things are fine. Good choice going to see a doctor, as they will be able to tell you definitively about it.

Do any of the Fitbits with sleep tracking work consistently? I have used the Alta HR for a couple of years and it is awful. It works decently for a week or 2 then not at all for weeks. Very hit and miss.  I've re-added, changed sensitivity and jumped all the hoops as directed by customer service. Any input would be appreciated and helpful in my next investment if I stay with Fitbit.

The sleep tile used to have a verticle blue line showing time asleep and red lines showing times awake.  These lines don't show up now.
@johnlsummey04 Thanks for sharing what happened with your friend. I also think that having the same resting schedule every day can help a lot with time. 🙂

Hi @stephan1980, Currently, Fitbits only log sleep, they don't really take action when sleep is detected. Maybe long-haul drivers could find such a feature helpful also? Anyway, feel free to make a proposal for this as a new feature here: Feature Suggestions

I want to do just the opposite.  I'm good with classifying trips to the bathroom as restless sleep.  (I'm not sleeping at that moment 🙂  🙂   But what I don't like is it totally stops sleep and starts a new sleep session when I get back in bed.  I have to go 30 steps down the hall.   What I'd like is some way to tell fitbit that if I get beck to motionless (even with a few steps) within 10 minutes, count it as part of the same sleep session.  Is there any way to do this?
Really if you're having multiple (dozens as seen in my graph) micro -awakenings it most likely is some kind of issue that should be checked medically.
Honestly, I've heard repeatedly that I should shut things down an hour before bed. You could also get some glasses that protect your eyes from that blue light - which allegedly tells your brain it's still daylight out.  I just take about 2-3mg of melatonin. Seems to work. On weekends, I don't take 'em at all, I just stay up later.

This is because the APP is messed up. There is another topic that has the issue nailed down, but because the topic is “answered” I think Fitbit is not working on it. The problem is the the data is collected but not graphing if your sleep time starts on one day and ends on the next (you sleep through midnight). Several folks have verified this is an accurate statement. Just can’t figure out how to get this to someone who can fit it.
Thanks man. Yeah I am almost tempted to go to bed earlier as i am so tiredbut thats probably the worst thing I could do.
I have used it to see my sleep patterns, when I am restless and awake throughout the night. It also opened my eyes to how little sleep I get each night usually 6 hours.
I'm not sure how useful these settings actually are. If I set mine to Normal mode it says that I sleep very well. In the mid 90s. If I set it to sensitive it says that I sleep very badly. In the mid 40s. One says that I sleep sopundly, the other says that I have 2-3 hour a ight sleep. I personally think that I sleep through the night, but move around a lot. So I'm not certain how much use the Fitbit data is. So I sleep badly, but am still sleeping, when the band thinks that I'm awake.
Here is an example of my sleep recording working.. even with about an hour being awake.. Between 3:57 and 4:57 I was consciously awake.. I listened the the radio news at 4:00am, did the bathroom thing and I knew I was awake.. With my low HR. maybe Fitbit measures that as light sleep or I was having micro sleeps because I always noticed my Google clock time

stress during the day, caffeine, alcohol, too hot / stuffy in the room, noise - all these affect your sleep and can reduce the percentage of being in deep sleep
I have had only 1 BR reading and 2 HRV readings in the past month. Did you manage to fix it?
@Startfit I've always had on and off sleep issues.  when i'm on a downhill with my sleep (like i am now)  it seems 4-5 hours is plenty, but also depends on what i do daily (stress level), since i typically work either a 8 hour day or a 15 hour day.  But when i don't sleep during the work week, i sleep 10 hours on friday night and saturday night.  I find that if i don't do this, my body won't function properly.  When I feel balanced and sleeping, eating and exercising regularly, i find that my optimal sleep is 6.5 hours.   For myself, it depends on stress/anxiety level, work/life balance and what I eat.  this varies so much week over week, I do the best for myself.
One of my fave feature about Fitbit is sleep tracking!! A1!!!
I have used the sleep statistics functionality on my Fitbits for a long time.  Last night, the statistics didn't show up at all.  I have a Fitbit Blaze now and it has been working fine up until today.  I just uninstalled and resinstalled the Fitbit app on my iPhone 7 but the sleep statistics are still not there.Was there a problem last night with the sleep statistics functionality?  If not, what should I do to make sure the sleeps statistics are working.

The following link gives some good info on sleep and the efficiency calculation:https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking
@sleepingmonster It's possible the tracker considers the 5 minutes to short for being fully awake and to end the sleep cycle. If needing to go to the bathroom for a few minutes for example and going back to sleep, it can be shown as 'awake' during the sleep cycle, however not necessarily created a second 'sleep cycle'.
Yes, probably sleep apnoea.

This may not be new information to anyone, but I'll share it just case.  I turned quick view off and slept significantly better last night.  Since getting my fitbit last weekend I've been waking up almost once an hour (actually waking up and consciously looking at the clock, not just talking about the number of times the graph says I'm awake).  I only remember waking up a couple times last night (even though the graph still says frequently woke up 1 minute at a time.
Fitbit's advice on this is: The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.The sensitive setting will cause your device to record nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake. This setting may be helpful for users who wake up feeling tired even though their sleep history shows sufficient rest.taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314/
Wouldn't more deep sleep be an indication of a "better" more restful sleep?  I just started tracking my sleep 🤦🏻‍:female_sign:🤦🏻‍:female_sign:🤦🏻‍:female_sign:...not too many minutes in deep sleep...exhausted most days🤷🏻‍:female_sign:
Melatonin has been a godsend for me. You're body produces it naturally when it starts getting dark to make you start getting sleepy. Since we're just getting started then it does us no good. You can buy it at walmart or most pharmacys. My main problem was staying asleep. Once I started taking it I have trouble getting myself to wake up half the time.
Only available in the US, UK and Australia, for whatever reason.
Two questions First, how can my sleep periods both start and stop with "awake" times? This doesn't make sense especially when it says time to fall asleep is 0 minutes. Second, when you go in to the detail screen you can hover over a restless period and it will tell you how long the restless period was. If you hover over a sleep period it gives you summary data for the whole night. While I am interested in my restless periods (I have a lot of them) I am even more interested in increasing my sleep periods but it is hard to calculate how long they are. Am I missing something or is there an easier way to do this? Thank you for taking the time to read and offer help.
Health advice is certainly sound and needed. But I think that you have already checked your health and there is no problem, if you are here. So let's look on the other side. How about physical activity in the daytime? And even better in the evening before going to bed? You put on body lingerie harness and your husband will not mind being awake next to you. And then you will sleep better.
I am pretty sure I don't sleep well because I never feel rested by the time my children wake me up around 5/5:30am, even though I go to bed by 9pm and they don't usually wake me up in the night anymore. Getting the fitbit charge HR was in part to see how I sleep - and finding that I only get 4-5 hrs of sleep despite being in bed 8-9 hours seemed to "prove" that I am not sleeping well - until I turned the setting to "normal" rather than sensitive. On "normal" it shows I get 8 hours of sleep. I took the data to my pulmonologist to try and get him to send me for a sleep study (they do that in the same office) but he laughed it off and said that the app on his phone tells him he's been getting a workout when he's been sitting on his couch playing games on his phone, so my sleep tracker is probably just measuring every twitch of my arm as me being "awake." He said to go through my family doctor who will probably send me to a psychologist to test for anxiety before she would send me for a sleep study. Really?! I am just not sleeping well, I'm not up worrying about anything all night, nor do I typically feel anxious during the day. Besides I have mild asthma (hence the pulmonologist visit) so would it not be normal for him to check for breathing issues at night??!
Sleep is an important part of weight loss. Studies have shown that weight loss while sleeping can happen on a daily basis, and only if you get enough sleep. This means that your weight will go up and down throughout the day as it should! If you want to burn fat, then make sure you're getting enough sleep!
 
But, what happen with our body when we don´t sleep well?
 



Appetite Increase 






Our brain has two important neurotransmitters, "Ghrelin and Leptin".






Ghrelin promotes hunger, and leptin contributes to feeling full. Our body proccess these nuerotransmitters and regulate them during the day, but a lack of sleep can affect the way our brain work with these and produce an increase of appetite , we will have more cravings and finally eat more.
 



Metabolic Disregulation






The way our metabolisim  increase or decrease affect directly the way our body burn fat.






The number of calories your body burns when you are completely at rest is know as RMR (Resting Metabolic Rate)  This index tends to decrease when you dont sleep well. Some studies made on men and women have shown a decrease of 5 to 20% of RMR as a result of sleep deprivation.
 



Less Energy






Sleep deprivation affect the energy needed to be phisycaly active.






If your are a person who is decided to weight loss and you already workout everyday  to burn those extra calories, you should know as well that a lack of sleeping  reduce the energy levels to face your day and you will tend to not to workout  properly.
"If you are looking for new ways to workout, I encourage you to research and considering YOGA as an option like . Not only help you to burn fat but also help you to achieve mental peace as an aid to have better sleep"
 
Tips for Quality Sleep during your weight loss journey:
- Keep Calm and Reduce Stress, learn to relax: Stressful situations could led to bad sleeping.
- Have a Sleep Schedule and stick to it: The habit of sleep every day at the same time help your body to get use to be ready to rest on schedule and complete your sleeping hours.
- Create the environment : Use your bed and your room only to rest, and always sleep in a dark room.
- Dont eat before bed: Your body need time to digest food then it would be difficult fall asleep.
- Natural nutrition suplements  can help as well, specially if you want to improve your deep sleep.
 

 I found   to help to gain deep sleep for me a good product as an AID not only to sleep better but also to help in your weight loss journey.

WHY are you sending the person to the COMPARE FEATURES page instead of INFORMING HIM you no longer offer the SNORE on ANY WATCH.
Thank you.  I figured that's what it was.  I do wake up and go to the bathroom.  I have mild apnea.  I treat it with an oral appliance.  I tried CPAP, but could not adapt and it beat me up.   I looked like I aged 10 years on CPAP.  Puffy face, dry eyes, mask lines.   The oral appliance is easier, but likely not as good as CPAP.  My AHI was 10 so not very high.  I am sure by learning to side sleep and using an oral appliance I am down to 5 or less which is considered normal.  Also with CPAP I never got as good a sleep score as with the TAP.  I think that's because CPAP woke me a lot during the night.  There was always something either with the hose, a mask leak, a mouth leak, humidity in the hose, etc.   Thanks!
For sleep tracking, any model with heart rate tracking should produce nearly same results.The Ionic, Charge 3, and Ionic all have relative SpO2 sensor that has the potential to estimate blood oxygen level.  This is currently not being used in sleep data but there is a possibility it might in the future. 

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Actually I was just wanting to know HOW fitbit measures these things (under that proprietary hood,) how that affects the difference is between sensitive and normal, why it differs for people etc. What kinds of things is Fitbit measuring that turn out to be irrelevant to actual sleep in a portion of the population using it? Are there physical factors that correlate roughly to actual sleep but that aren’t actual artifacts of sleep?(Kind of like the way grinding coffee on my manual coffee grinder with my Fitbit arm adds up steps.) Curious minds want to know - but they aren’t going to tell us! (Of course I wouldn’t use a Fitbit to rule out a sleep disorder if I really thought I had one.)
What pencil icon? I am using both the desktop page (Browser) and the app on my iPhone. I tried to Edit Sleep on the desktop and only ended up losing sleep data. It is very confusing having a night's sleep broken up into two pieces. Is there any way I can make the app keep track of an entire night, even if I am awake for a significant period during the night? Hint: I bought my Fitbit Versa for the PRIMARY reason that I have a sleep disorder and need to keep track of my sleep, but I often have one period during the night when I am awake for an hour or so.
I wish I had the answer, I fall asleep no problem its staying asleep that's a challenge. But I am curious about something.. Do you fight thinking or do you just let it happen? You know when your mind is racing about whatever and you overlay that with why am I still awake, if I fall asleep now.. blah blah. If you let it go and just think without the background noise, do you think it will just lull itself to sleep? Almost like that's your brain's lullaby?

For the last three nights my Fitbit Flex has registered 100% sleep efficiency even though it shows I woke up multiple times. That just doesn't make sense. I am wearing it a bit more snugly and wondered if that made a difference.  I found the other similar comments and the fix to add a minute to the wake up end.  Hope the company fixes this soon.
Is the sleep funciton accurate?  Mine is showing that I only get 3 or 4 hours of sleep every night.  Restless for the most part
Since the start and wake-up times are always inaccurate in the Blaze why not have a "Manual" sleep section in "Exercise" so you can accurately register sleep time. Similar to the "Walk" function. You could also include a pause button. This would be similar to the sleep function in the One which is fully manual. The One is accurate. You could give a choice of Manual or Automatic in the set-up.

My 'estimated oxygen variation' had the same drastic changes after receiving the Moderna vaccine.  I got my second shot mid-February.  My 'estimated oxygen variation' chart continues to show a very erratic pattern.  Pre-vaccine my 'estimated oxygen variation' graph only showed minor ups/downs and they were always in the green.  Does your 'estimated oxygen variation' graph continue to look so jagged??
Hi everyone!
 
I've come across different sites where it says that sleeping with the AC or a fan turned on all night might have a negative impact on your health, and some others says that it's 100% safe. What are your experiences with this? What are your tricks to sleep when heat goes up?
 
During summer nights it could be difficult to sleep and leaving the window open sometimes is not an option due to bugs.

I’m aware of that page and the hours I sleep each night. I want to see my WEEKLY SLEEP HOURS AVERAGE. I find the ‘sleep score’ absolutely useless and do not understand the change. For shift workers the previous weekly average hours setting was much better.
Technically the ultra tracks sleep as well so if you can get one of those (they came out before the one and are still around in places like ebay and the like) it will track sleep just like the one. I haven't heard that any one device is better than the other in terms of accuracy for sleep tracking. I use my ultra every night and have done so since I got it in 2011 and think the results are very representative of my sleep.

Here's my data - Last night was with a zopiclone since the two hour nights earlier in the week were too much to take. My sleep has been awful for years - my phone used to ring a lot at 2AM for work related issues; plus personal things that kept me up at night. It finally caught up to me earlier this year (I'm 45).I'm working with a sleep therapist and I'm also on the sleepio site (doing sleep restriction and fixing sleep hygiene). Breaking some of the bad habits has proven difficult but slowly getting there. It's decently accurate - I find nights where it records two hours or less correspond to feeling awful and tired all day. Nights where it's three or higher I feel much better.
I have had the same issue for the last four days. 100 percent sleep efficiency every day in spite of awake time and restless time.
Hi @CallieM. Yesterday I had to manually put in my sleep for some reason. I changed some setting and it appears that it logged my sleep last night. So not sure what I did wrong. I just wanted to make sure that I did not have to go back to setting my device to sleep or remembering approximately when I get in the bed. Thank you!
Don't return it. That's really how much "real" sleep you are getting. It's measuring your movements when you sleep, and most of us didn't know we moved that much. Try comparing the nights you feel well-rested and the nights you know you didn't sleep well.
hiya, I do have sleep apnea  which was picked up by my restless sleep. I also used to snore loudly. When I spoke to my doctor about it, she did a questionaire about my sleep during the day - I.E could I fall asleep while being a passenger in a car on a long journey, Did I fall asleep while watching tv................. I scored high on this so I was referred to a sleep clinic. I had a machine overnight which recognised how often I stopped breathing & because this was high I then had another machine which told the clinic when I was affected. I now have a cpap mask & have had since october. I go back to the sleep clinic on 3 Feb to see what difference it is making.  My fitbit however does still show that I have restless sleep, but I no longer fall asleep in the car on long journeys & I no longer fall asleep at the cinema. My point to this post is that if you or your doc thinks that there is a chance that you have apnea, he shouldnt be relying on teh fitbit, he should be asking you to complete the questionaire & referring you if needed.
This is so trueeee!!! Love the post.
Hello @corieann, do you have your sleep set for normal and not sensative.. Unless you have a specific reason it should be set to normal.  As you noticed I moved the thread from the I need help to the discussion forums better sleep. This seems to fit the topic closer and opens the thread to all the tracker a that monitor sleep.. Only 1 tracker doesnt.
@Kirsten1983  Once you're out of bed, are you tired? The meds you're taking can make it hard to get to sleep, which explains your struggle with it. Have you done any research on Citalapram? You shouldn't be drinking while taking it and you've mentioned being hungover. Have you spoken to your health care professional about this? The answer could be as simple as a change of medication or some tests to determine the root cause of this. If you don't already, try keeping a journal of your sleep as well as your acitivities. Maybe you and your doctor can figure something out. Welcome to the forums.

Going back to sleep or staying in bed can be a nasty downard spiral - during my uni years i used to sleep far too much (not alcohol induced) and even into the early afternoon 😞 . You can find the more you sleep the more you feel tired and then sleep more, it is a result of your body never really waking up. I changed a few things and resolved it (eventually).  - don't sleep on the sofa: you won't get a good nap, it is bad for your body as sofas arent designed for supporting you and most importantly you link your sofa with sleep - beds are for sleeping. If you avoid napping on the sofa eventually you will stop linking your sofa with nap, and will be less likely to desire a nap when sitting down. - Make the bedroom (and living room) inhospitable to sleep in the day: open the curtains (do this in the whole house), make the bed and throw the laundry on it. If napping is hard work you are less likely to do it. - spend the time you would nap doing something you like as a reward; watch your favourtie TV program, read a book. It is great to have "me time" don't waste it sleeping! - Put on some up beat music, you'll find it helps you wake up and get moving Someone once told me "energy begetts energy" - I ahve foudn this to be true so being active makes it easier to be active the next day so the advice above of doing something active is also good.
Yes, Erick, I checked online dashboard immediately after you requested I do so in an earlier post. I answered that yes then it was the same and is still the same with a gap now. I even tried logging in and out of app and gap is still there. Still no answer for gap. Thanks.Teresa 🙂
I agree. Unfortunately, he doesn't. 😞

Hi!I created a fix for this problem and posted it over here (click) under HR help forum. Hope this helps. 🙂
Does anyone have any thoughts on correlation between sleeping position and sleep quality?  In my case, chronic low back pain turned me from a back/stomach sleeper to an exclusively side sleeper. While the former predated any sort of sleep tracking, I can say with certainty that my sleep quality improved vastly on my sides. It could be that my back pain, which is position dependent, was a major factor here which is why I'm curious.  According to my tracker, I now consistently get 35-45% deep sleep, sometimes as high as 50% like last night (~4 hrs spent in deep sleep). A large portion of every night is spent in a vivid dreaming state. Before, that wasn't the case. As an aside, I also went from frequent snoring to almost no snoring when on my side. That's according to my wife. 😀  Any thoughts/experience?
I am very disappointed I now have to pay for this feature. Apple Watch is looking like a much better option
I am 70. I have been waking at 3AM for many years. When that happens I can not fall back to sleep. It was a horror when I was working, watching that clock move to 4, 5, 6 knowing I had to get up soon to get ready for work. I would get out of bed, turn on computer, have a cup of coffee, then was able to fall back to sleep.It has been less years when I wake several times a night to empty bladder; but do not have trouble drifting back off to sleep for those wake ups. I know other people who wake at 3AM, causing me to wonder what it is about that time that causes people to wake up.
Today is Friday. My fitbit says that "Thursday" I slept from 11:53pm - 7:44am.  And "Today," I slept from 2:44am - 7:45am.Is "Thursday" actually Wednesday night, and "Today" is actually Thursday night??And don't ask me what time I actually fell asleep, because either of those times could be right...
Thanks Michelle.  Unfortunately my fitbit appears to be dead. And its only 5 months old I believe...tt was a replacement unit for my previously fried unit. And I haven't downloaded ios 13 yet. My unit was working perfectly until fitbit started removal of sleep diagnostics via their "update" process. It's been a nightmare since then. I have gotten used to taking my daily hike without a device again.
Mine stopped as well this week. Gives me how many hours but does not give the detail it used to.
@Hats26 wrote:Cheers Michael! Yeah.. I'm thrilled with how I have done so far. 8k before work might not happen again, but it was a brilliant feeling! 4 hour run/walk in the countryside, brilliant exploring different routes. A friend of mine has said that I should do a half marathon with her considering I did over 13 miles today, I guess I would do it once to tick it off the list but I'm not the type that will keep doing certain events. I love the thrill of obstacles and entertaining events. Yeah... When I was a teenager I never seemed to have any issues post skiing. Now I make sure I have deep heat in case and stretch. I have been a skier since 5 years old or something and have always loved ski holidays. I'd probably say it is my favourite sport to do.  How long should you let your body recover? How does the motivation come back? I always struggle after the holidays. Receiving this after Christmas was amazing. I'd have loved to taken it to France but my boyfriend wisely said I might lose it and I barely knew/had time to work out how to work it at that point so I agreed not to take it with me. If my breathing & arches strengthen up better I can see myself running more consistently. It would be good to enjoy swimming more too. Just anything that will make me fit... Whereas at the moment my appearance is deceiving & people assume I'm fit. I was amused by a remark by someone from fitbit community struggling to work out why my breathing was so bad when I'd done exercise before December. I'd like to say I have sports induced asthma but I'd probably be lying 😛 and to get fit is like a piece of string isn't it... I feel good though, almost reached my 30k today & 500 Miles in lifetime badge. So as long as I keep going and don't stop then the motivation issue will be fine 🙂  Yes. Motivation will hopefully stick. Otherwise I'll need a massive kick. I enjoy sharing my updates with you Michael 🙂 thank you for your support. Term is now over.. I'll set some time to let my body recover. Hey @Hats26 I am sorry for the delay in replying to your last disussion post.  I enjoy reading your updates as they are very inspiring to me and I am sure others as well.  I actually will be covering recovery on the next episode of my show this Sunday, so great topic I think. Of course recovery depends on the activity a person did and the intensity, etc.  I will always tell people to listen to their body regardless of what they hear or read.  If your body is in pain, that is your body telling you it needs rest.  Pushing through pain or soreness is not something I would endorse nor support. I think the events you are working to participate in help you stay accountable.  Of course, organized sports and events can be a real motivator as you continue to prepare.  Skiing I can see is a big passion of yours, as you have done it for so long.  I think that to do things you are passionate about can make exercise that much more fun.   Continue to do what you are doing and listen to your body.  Your body will let you know when you are over training. Hope you are having a brilliant weekend!

I have been trying to use my fitbit One to track my sleep. Since its purchase a few months ago, I have not been successful in consistently tracking and syncing my sleep data. Is anyone else experiencing this difficulty or do I have a defective fitbit One?
If you're using free weights your fitbit might be recording it as steps anyway. When I'm stapling stuff at work or shuffling papers (I do a lot of this) fitbit counts all the movements as steps.
Hi @Rocketr, That's an interesting question. I saw an article here that lists sleep time by age. But I didn't see anything that broke it down to sleep stages. The percentages for Fitbit users are: I've read that with age, it becomes harder to get deep sleep especially.

Hi everyone! It's good to see you here.
 
Thanks for taking the time to share your experience with our Fitbit devices. Let me explain that when your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your device records that you’re asleep. If your device tracks heart rate and you slept for more than 3 hours, you'll see sleep stages recorded. 
 
Take in mind that if your device detects excessive movement, your device will either record time spent awake or stop tracking your sleep. To learn more about how our Fitbit devices track sleep data, please see this help article.
 
To prevent any misunderstanding or confusion, I'm going to close this thread from further comments. Your feedback is appreciated and we'll keep working to improve our products and features to make Fitbit more useful for you.
Thanks. I think the graph is correct actually.Unfortunately something compresses the file leaving a very low quality image. Can you see this one better? My dashed line is at 49: my RHR for the day. Most of my sleep is above 49, with an average of 51 yesterday.
Thank you. Still doesn't explain why the scores differ, right?
Absolutely confused i am new to this concept Which is better 4 hours deep sleep or 8 hours sleep ?

Thanks for this post.  Your doctor seems to put this in perspective.  I’ve noticed a correlation between orange spikes and vivid dreams during REM sleep.  Mostly all green nights, but once or twice a week a get a single orange spike during REM sleep, and often remember having a vivid, sometimes scary, dream at that time.
@MCWS There is another thread here that provides a good description of the missing sleep logs some users seem to have been experiencing.
 
Do you mind checking over that thread?  If that is the same thing, or a similar phenomenon to the issue you are having with your Flex, I encourage you to continue the conversation there.  I'll be updating that thread as more information becomes available about this.
 
Thanks for your patience!

Hey, it's been over a week. The fitbit is not even a year old and I rely on the sleep function for my health. Is there anyway to fix this or should I look into Apple watches?
I hope a moderator will delete this--I would have done that myself but I don't seem to have that ability available to me. Anyhow...  The issue is solved.  Wrote down all of the sleep wake times, deleted a bunch of sleep records, signed out of the app, turned off bluetooth, and then used the online dashboard to add records back in.  One record is messed up, as in it did not give me sleep zone data and also said I was asleep during some time frames when I was awake and even out of the bed walking around.  I took that one back out and split it into two separate records (with a 30 minute gap for the one time frame where I knew for certain I was awake).  I think that's good enough.  I have the impression that up until now (greater than six months of logs) those longer periods of awake time have shown up fairly accurately regardless of whether the data were good enough to show sleep stages, so I hope that is not a new thing that is going to be happening more often.  Maybe this will help someone else.

I used to have those symptoms...until i got prescribed a CPAP because of my severe Sleep Apnea. In general, under sleep apnea stress, the more you sleep the worse you feel because you have more air flow interruptions. With the CPAP, i feel fresh everytime i wake up...the only symptom i might have if i sleep less than i need is a migraine.
I completely agree. That is why I don't really bother with the fitbit sleep section. I still wear it to bed, but I relay on the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock for a better idea of how to improve my sleep qulity. Honestly I was REALLY disapointed with sleep tracking that Fitbit does. I am glad that it is not the main feature of it.
My sleep scores are also zero. My fitbit keeps needing to be re-synced so it thinks I've got a new one every week.It appears to be faulty. Where do I return it for a reund?
I picked up a Pavlok & set myself to go to sleep at 10, so it vibrates at about 15 till to remind me and so on.  Something that I found helpful, was after I established that I was going to definitly be Up at 5am, I know that I am now going to have to make sure that I get to bed at 10.  that schedule routine really does help.  But I found that If I have a little negative inforcement {a mild electrial shock or use your imagination} if I break the rules {screens in bed, or hitting the snooze button in the morning} I have really started getting a lot better at keeping a routine and establishing a Habit of getting a good nights sleep.  Accountability counts for a LOT when it comes to getting a good nights sleep. I also found, that If I take a little herbal sleep aid, mild but a good formula that I atleast find myself drousy at bed time, Its easier for me to lay down with the intent of sleeping & not just letting my mind spin and ending up watching Youtube in the sack for 2 hours before I actually clock out.  this also helps as I put my glasses up, I put on my CPAP mask, I establish a proper routine for actually laying down to go to sleep, that I have found is being reinforced and is working.  It makes me really happy to know its been a week since I have slept on my glasses (ends up with me rolling on them, causing mild damage that I have to bend out in the morning).
Hello everyone! These are a few ways of how to get better sleep that have helped me, that may help you: Wearing sleep maskGetting a blanket/pillow to your likingListening to calm music/ Rain MachineTurning all lights offHaving a comfortable Mattress  Hope these help you! 😉
Thanks will do!
thanks for sharing I have a very similar graph. I think I might get tested.
Well I still don't understand the question. Your saying that you want the time awake to be recorded as being asleep so that your doctor can better understand your sleeping habits. To me this makes no sense, especially considering a paid sleep study would mark the time awake as being awake.I was trying to elaborate on what info a sleep study would give and how it relates to the info Fitbit provides. As for your question, it simply does not make sense to me and I'm not sure where the thought is coming from or what logic was used to come to the conclusion that awake time needs to be recorded as sleep.
Hi @CHRiSGREEN77, Currently, that can't be done, and I don't expect Fitbit would start doing that. Or else people could manipulate the numbers any way they want to get any kind of sleep score. But feel free to make a post in the Feature Suggestion section of the site, so they can see the idea and other people can vote on it also. If enough people vote for it, Fitbit may implement it.You can edit the sleep start and stop times, but not the sleep score directly. I've also had the problem with the device mistakenly treating nighttime TV as sleep. The workaround that helped is I take the tracker/watch off while doing this kind of thing, and then put it on right before bed. It's a good time to give the device a charge, and then when I put it on and go to bed, the sleep tracking is accurate. Hope this helps.

I have a recording of rain I have listened to over and over.  I like it better than waves but years ago I went to a big group hypnosis session for dieters and there they used waves and "white noise".   After I started playing my rain CD I never turned on my bedroom TV again.  Any time I wake I start it again.  I can do that just by pressing a button in the dark.
If any use ZMA (Zinc Monomethionine Aspartate, Magnesium Aspartate and Vitamin B6)Use 3 caps b4 your bad time, that sould help.

Thank you both for that advice. I hadnt synced it for the alarm and just hadnt read instructions properly about the lights and vibrating. I think I have that bit now. But........Can you also tell me why bother putting it in sleep mode when you go to bed?Thanks.
Awesome!  Thanks for the info!!
Hi(:im 22 F, 5'4 and 164lbs. I started at 196 a year ago so about 30 pounds. I work out a little bit not anything crazy, yet:)Anyways just a health question. I have a low heart rate normally ... 50's and drops into the upper 40's when lying down for bed but at night my Hr drops to 42:/ i do sometimes get dizzy and SOB. I've had EKGs, blood work and X-ray nothing came back abnormal... but I know and have read that a low heart rate is okay if you're an athlete. I'm not. I have an apt with a cardiologist next week.... does anyone know If this is normal even if you're not an athlete?? I'm freaking out a bit:/
Happens to me too.  I figure sometime during night, it thought you were up and calculated score;  but with later data, it realized you were going back to sleep and it should all count as the same sleep session.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

How does Fitbit tell the difference?  For example, me getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night is seen as "awake" (I assume), not that I'm actually up.
Which fitbit do you have? If you have the flex, you tap on it until the two lights flash, then you are in sleep mode. When you wake up, you tap it again until the first light stays on, indicating it is ready for the new day. On your dashboard, go to the little box with 3 parallel lines in it in the upper left of your screen. That will allow you to control which tiles are on the dashboard.  I hope that helps.
I'm a full time student,employee, father and husband I can understand how hard it is to get quality sleep. With the lack of quality sleep you are getting I would reccomend speaking with your family physician. If you didnt wan't to go that route maybe consider Yoga, meditation or something that may help relieve stress and relax you. I know when I'm dead tired at night and get in bed I usually turn on the television or read the news on my phone which is a really bad thing to do. I find that I get a better night sleep if I  leave all electronic devices off.Good Luck to you
Thanks again, Laurie, that’s very helpful information in understanding how sleep is analysed. I can work with the results I am seeing.
hey @ChaloopaBatm4n congrats on your purchase and welcome to the community. I have heard others have similar issues with fatigue when working shift work because you don't really have a night vs day. It is just time which causes naps not sleep. Even five hours ones don't feel like sleep. I think having a perm schedule will help because even in day you will have a designated time for sleep. You may also want to look at how much activity you are getting, how hydrated you are and what your diet is. All those things help to keep your body running efficiently so even a few sleepless nights won't completely knock you out.

No idea what should be normal but comparied to my results, yours are excellent.  I tend to be in the 70% range with several awake periods and usually 15 to 20 restless only sleeping average of 4 hours per night
Of course you go to bed and get up at the same time as often as you can, you sleep ias far as is possible in complete darkness and quiet, you don't eat for 3-4 hours before going to bed, unless a glass of walm milk etc, ...assuming, then, your sleep hygiene is correct, consider the following, perhaps:Do you know if your nose is stuffed up, and/ or or if you snore? (You can get a snore recording app).Or if your tongue is too big for your mouth and so (slightly or otherwise) interferes with breathing? (look for serrated / scalloping marks on side of tongue)Or if you have gastric reflux or teeth / gum inflammation?Correcting any or all of these may help, but it may involve an ENT or a specialist sleep dentist or both. Good luck.
Hi, I have a similar issue. I’ve been tracking my sleep for a fortnight and my SHR is usually above my resting RHR for 95-97% of the night, with the small percent below being towards the end of my sleep usually. I’ve noted the affect alcohol and eating late have (those two things normally happen together) but even if I eat 5 hours before bed or fast completely, aswell as other factors like going to bed early, it’s still high. i can’t find anything online about this pattern, only spikes, but this is more a reverse hammock.
I bought my Fitbit 5 days ago and was deleted to see the sleep recording REM and Deep sleep.  All of a sudden my recording last night started recording like my old Fitbit HR with only sleep, awake and restless.  Anyone know why.
Interesting topic @Startfit! 
 
I always have 8 hours as my main goal, but hardly ever reach it 😅 
 
I think it depends on the person and that you're used to, I usually feel tired when I sleep for 6 hours, but this doesn't happen when I manage to sleep for 7 hours. That extra hour of sleep does seem to make the difference for me during the day! 😁

I don’t think your body cares about the exact timing of your hydration, as long as it gets enough of it at the daily level.

@sandycrochet When you track your sleep, where do you wear your Fitbit One? It should be on your wrist every night. If your tracker is worn consistently in the same place with the same setting, the data it provides should be useful in helping you analyze your sleep patterns over time.  It's better if you keep your sleep settings set to normal. You can verify them here. We're all different and our sleep depends in our habits. We have to sleep seven to eight hours every night and that should give you an idea if you need to go to bed earlier. I found out that I was sleeping 5 hours only so I focused on that.  A "restless" state of sleep indicates that your body transitioned from a very restful position with little movement to moving around or tossing and turning. This does not mean that you were awake and cognizant of your movements, but it may indicate that you were not getting the most restful sleep possible at that time. When your body is completely at rest and you are not moving, your Fitbit tracker records that as being "asleep." And when your tracker indicates that you are moving so much that restful sleep would not be possible, your sleep graph will indicate that you were "awake." It's better if you don't share your tracker. Or you can update your profile settings. If you own a Premium account, you'll see that there's a Benchmark option. From there it compares you to every other user in the Fitbit database that have selected to be part of those stats. You can compare yourself depending on your age, weight and gender) and allows you to export your data as well.

For me, it's a combination of a few things: 400mg of magnesium right before bed (sounds like "woo" but it's science, trust me) Easy on the carbs for dinner and after so my blood sugar doesn't do a nosedive in the middle of the night and wake me up Keeping the bedroom really, really dark Being active during the day so I'm tired at night Trying to keep the drama to a minimum so I don't wake up and stress over it, and marginalizing any family and friends that insist on dragging it into my life

Do look at your vitamin intake. Supplements can assist in staying asleep. My husband has significantly deeper sleeps (stops waking up during the night) with ZMA (zinc, magnesium, vitamins). One regimen I was on for a while had vitamin D in the morning, and ZMA & melatonin in the evening before bed to 'get a deeper level of sleep'.
I've been tracking my sleep since getting my fitbit 2.5 years ago.  It seems to work well.  I usually agree when it shows that I've had a lot of deep sleep.  I defintiely feel more rested after those nights.  The thing that puzzles me though is that very frequently I need to edit the time at which I go to bed.  This is because for some reason my device stops recording my heart rate for 30 minutes to an hour after I lie down.  Admittedly, I do have a pretty slow heart rate (sometimes below 40 BPM while I'm resting) but I know my heart doesn't totally stop.  LOL At least I don't think it does.
Can you tell me how do you monitor your cpap machine from your home? Can you do it from your fitbit somehow? How do you score your sleep from fitbit?
Do you sleep in a dark room and get bright light exposure first thing in the morning? Those are factors crucial to having a proper circadian rhythm, and the circadian rhythm is linked to normal REM cycles.
I only just got my FitBit (Flex) and I already know I have sleep issues, but wearing in on my non-dominant hand, keeping the setting on normal, sleeping with a dog and a husband, my percentages are accurate for they amount and type of sleep I get.  With my medication for the insomnia (Bi-polar and manic primarily at night) I have gotten between 85-90% percent. The awake and restlessness are also very accurate with what I know about my sleeping patterns.   If you wake up in the morning feeling unrested (before ever having the fit-bit) find yourself tired throughout the day, etc., or are just worried about your quality of sleep, it isn't harmful to bring it up to your General Practitioner and see what they suggest.  Perhaps your FitBit did just discover something about you that can help improve your quality of life, which is what it's purpose is anyways, right?
Monday's sleep score was 87 and today's is 85. I feel like today's sleep score is a lie since I slept horribly.  The dog woke me up to go potty at midnight and I was awake until 2am.  And then my sleep was pretty awful and restless until I woke up at 5:15am.  Sometimes I feel like the sleep score doesn't accurately represent how I feel.  Maybe I need it on a more sensitive setting to show just how much I toss and turn.

I really liked my fitbit but alas it came undone (again) while I was out and I could not locate it! The latch needs some work. I'm not sure I want to invest another $150 for another Charge model- it might become latched again.  Mike Briggs Washougal WA
Yeah, mine are pretty bad, too. I get sleep, but not the way I'd like to.
Just wanted to say thanks for your service and glad you got checked out.  I have slight sleep apnea and once I got used to the CPAP it greatly improved my quality of life.  Hoping it will do the same for you.
I don't use it after it came undone and attached itself to my husband.  He wasn't happy when the alarm when off in the middle of his back.  Now I use the holder attached to the collar of my night shirt.  The fitbit is inside facing my chest.   After 5 months I haven't lost it.
I wish there a slider mode where we could  control how 'sensitive' it is. For me, if I set it to Normal mode I'm always 95-98% sleep efficiency. The sensitive mode is closer to reality but likely too low. I've had sleep issues pretty much since I was 13 years old.   This is last night which I would consider a good night.  A bad night from a couple of weeks ago looked like this. This was definitely a bad night and I felt it the next day.   I'm typically alright if I come in over 3 hours per night. If it gets below 2 then it's a problem. I started seriously working on this issue middle of last year when the two hour (and less!) nights seemed to happen quite often. Now I'm trending higher - the sleep latency seems to be better (used to lie awake an hour before falling asleep). The good sample above doesn't show this but I typically tend to sleep well in the first half of the night then poorly in the second half.
@Vic007luvlif you are tired because of illness, you need more rest, so try to get to bed earlier. I realize this will deviate from your current pattern, but getting more rest is key to recovery. Pick an earlier time to go to bed and stick with the time you are accustom to waking up. Get good rest and feel better!

Well - you get 7.5 hours sleep at night so a nap seems reasonable.I'd take the approach that the kids are off to school and this is 'your time'. Get them out of the house and you are good to go. Go to the mall, go to the gym, go to the park.  Grab a coffee and do whatever you want to do. Go swimming. Whatever.  Do a workout tape or Xbox fitness. After that time for a quick nap before work. Pretty soon you will value 'your time' more than sleeping.

I don't agree that vigorous exercise doesn't help with insomnia. I find that high intensity exercise helps with stress management. Stress is what causes my insomnia, so anything that decreases my stress level helps me sleep better at night.

My sleeping patterns seem to be wildly inconsistent. Most nights I have 2 readings.  I've slept from 9 hrs one night to 2 the next.  It says I average less than 4 hours.  I wake up anywhere from 4 to 18 times.  My efficiency ranges from 50-95.  I've always had sleep issues so it is set to sensitive.  I put it to normal but it didn't make much difference.  Should I be worried? Is it my flex or is it me?
Ok, I've got a problem I hadn't anticipated.  Back when I was REALLY obese... 281 lbs, 10:30 roll around, and I'd get sleepy.  I could lie down on the bed...  Out in like 15 seconds....  Tired the next day...Now that I've changed my diet, and exercising, now I'm never getting sleepy...  I've droped 31 lbs, 66 to go. I'm going to bed at after midnight, and walking up before my alarm clock at 6:30 AM.  Plus it takes me several minutes to fall asleep.  Sometimes 30 or more.    The next day I'm not tired!  I feel full of energy all the time. I've pretty given up caffinine completely.  Almost drink nothing but water.  I am eating dinner a little later due to the amount of exercise I'm getting.  I'm walking about 80-90 minutes every other day.  So I'm eating closer to 8 PM.  But dinner is usually in the 600-800 calorie range.Just curious if anyone has trouble sleeping now that they are getting fit?  Yesterday I hit 15,000 steps for the first time...  After work I walked 4 miles went home, showered, left the house, got dinner, and then went grocery shopping... And I never got sleepy...  Tired for sure.  But not sleepy.  Keep in mind I'm almost 49!Anyone else?

I agree. If I'm dehydrated I find it hard to fall asleep. I have an alarm set on my phone to remind me to drink water thru out the day. It helps some of the time.

Hi @Sliffer I don't know of any major changes in sleep tracking between the Alta Hr and Charge 3. Did it not track sleep at all, or did it track it, but without giving sleep stages?Try restarting the Charge 3 and see if that fixes it for tonight. Let us know.

Not yet. I even changed settings to sensitive and according to results only slept for 3.5 hours one night when I know I was hardly awake.
I just got my fitbit charger 2 today, and my resting heart rate is : 89 or 90 which is considered normal.
I love this idea of a sleep challenge! I have sleep apnea and use a machine every night, so my sleep quality is good, but I rarely if ever hit my goal! Awesome idea 😀
My bed is nice and comfy, I spent a lot of time choosing it. I use a thin pillow, if I use anything else it kills my neck.
I'd love to see Sleep Challenges on Fitbit. I've been trying to improve my sleep quality by taking in consideration sleep score details. In my case, it has worked. But I'd like to have the option to share my goals and try to improve together with my friends. 💛
 
I think that Sleep Challenges can be based on sleep quality and duration of sleep. I'd like to have the option to set different goals, like "Best Score" or "Who slept more time". You got the idea.

Hi @amandajwong - Sorry to hear of your issues. There are some versions of CBD gummies that are specifically focused for issues such as sleep, energy, joint pain, etc. You may want to stop at a good health food store (such as Fresh Thyme) where knowledgeable people can point you to a version that may help. If you want to try this approach, please let your doctors know in case of any interaction with your meds. But at the advice of my doctor, I take 2, 10 mg CBD gummies for my arthritis. They really help. Good luck!
@WilsonFitbit Yeah, let's hope it's just the quiting smoking, and not sleep apnea, those masks look really uncomfortable to sleep with 😬
Personally i was surprised that they even could do sleep stages with this thing and thought of it as a bonus,not a deal breaker.
I'm sorry, but what more info can I provide? I've had screens where no data can be collected during sleep (but they look totally different).    The one I posted looks like it worked well (I just had zero deep or REM sleep at all).
i have sleep score and dont have premium
If you're referring to seeing just times awake, restless, etc instead of REM, Light, etc... if the sleep record is not long enough, it doesn't show the REM, etc.  I believe I'd seen 3 hours to be the minimum for it to display the detailed info.  My recent history reflects this as well.

Hi vbarboza90.  I think it's always best to check with your doctor if you're concerned.  For me, taking a liquid calcium / magnesium supplement before bed helps (2 tablespoons).  I think it helps with relaxation. Also, I sometimes drink a cup of chamomile or "Sleepy Time" tea near bedtime.  Also, avoiding watching the news at night, working, exercising too close to bedtime, or drinking coffee or alchoholic beverages too close to bedtime also helps me, as does doing stretching exercises and praying. Best wishes to you!

I am a fitful sleeper too. Plagued by allergies and lately getting up to pee...ugh. Sleep apnea is not however just an issue that keeps you from getting a good nights sleep. Untreated sleep apnea can lead to high blood pressure, heart diesase etc. If the issue is weight and you are trying to lose its a good idea to use the CPAP until you can control it some other way...you'll get used to it.
@Zil75@trev4120No, your mobile phone does not need to remain on at night in order for your silent alarm to go off.

Hello @Baltoscott. It's nice to see you around! 
 
In my own experience, taking a shower before bed has helped me a lot! It makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. I'll be interested to know how it goes for you 😃

This is an extract from one of the help files: "Your overall sleep score is a sum of your individual scores in sleep duration, sleep quality, and restoration, for a total score of up to 100. Most people get a score between 72 and 83. Sleep score ranges are:Excellent: 90-100Good: 80-89Fair: 60-79Poor: Less than 60Duration: Time asleep and awakeHow much you slept—the more you sleep, the better your score.Quality: Deep & REM sleepHow much time you spent in deep and REM sleep—the more time you spend in these sleep stages, the better your score.Restoration: Sleeping heart rate & restlessnessHow relaxed you were during sleep—a high sleeping heart rate or too much tossing and turning lowers your score.Note that you must see sleep stages to see sleep score. For more information, see What should I know about sleep stages?"

Interesting 🧐, it seems to be a little more jagged but not to much. I can’t wait to see what tonight brings.
I am wondergint the same thing... I too notice the same anomolies...  I wonder which is  teh accurate count , thanks
@Karatejoeri Welcome to Fitbit Community! It's possible to get 97% of sleep efficiency. Fitbit uses the following equation to calculate your sleep efficiency: time asleep / (total time in bed - time to fall asleep) Check if you're getting more restless portions at the beginning. Because once you start sleep tracking, the time it takes for you to actually fall asleep will not be incorporated into this calculation. If you don't move all night it is possible to get 100% sleep efficiency even if it takes you 10 or more minutes to fall asleep. Let me know if you have another question. I'm more than willing to help. 

Stephanie | Community AdvocateAll that stepping got you exhausted? Improve Your Zzzs!
Have you tried getting a new bed?I slept fine all through college. Then, when I moved to a new city to start my first big-boy job, I found that I had a lot of trouble sleeping. For the first 1.5 years, I tossed and turned most nights, and just couldn't sleep.The mattress I was sleeping on was a 10 year old hand-me-down. I finally decided to get a new mattress, and it was like a light switch. All of a sudden, no issues sleeping whatsoever. The odd thing was, that I thought my old mattress was super comfortable, so I might never have guessed that it was the cause of my sleep woes.If your put off by the cost of a mattress, just think of it as an investment. You spend a third of your life on it, you may as well get something decent. I spent $400 on a queen from a mattress outlet. If I only kept the mattress for a year, that's a little over $1/day....Anyways, good luck to you!
I managed to get a new record low sleep score - by sleeping for 10 hours. So it certainly seems that it considers sleeping too long far worse than not sleeping enough, even though how you feel the next day will be pretty much the opposite.
2 nights ago my CPAP unplugged (darn dog) and my device showed 140 instances of awake in a 7 hr period, all 40 seconds or less my diagnosis was 25 per hour, (I was exhausted all day) so it was fairly on par, last night with my CPAP I "only" had 33 instances during a 7 and an half hour night. while I won't consider my device sufficient for a diagnosis I can definitely see and monitor the impact on my sleep pattern with my CPAP. I'm getting a new Unit tomorrow (mine is over 8 years old) so I am waiting to see if the newer machine will yield better results.
@shadowstar240What you are seeing is normal. In the Fitbit Premium Sleep analysis they state, "It's normal for your sleeping heart rate to be below your Resting Heart Rate for much of the night. ".. In my case my RHR is 58, and last night my sleeping HR was below that for 60% of the night, mainly in the later 2/3rds of the night.  it peaks at the start at around 70bpm as I settle down.. and then near the end it gets down to 49... Genetics for me... other times it has got down to 41.... I find that that the extra blanket causes me to have disturbed sleep and raises my RHR for that day by a couple of points.. then during the day it drops back again..  In Melbourne we can have four seasons in one day. @shadowstar240 wrote:I've just started monitoring my sleeping heart rate and I'm finding that it is mostly always higher than my resting heart rate. My resting heart rate during the day hovers around 60bpm. I'm sleeping really poorly at the moment and have found that my heart rate seems to increase as I'm falling asleep but then gets lower towards the morning. I can't find anything that says if my sleeping heart rate should be lower than my resting heart rate - I just want to find out if this is unusual. I find that I get really hot in my sleep too when I'm normally always cold while awake.

So, whenever I edit a sleep log it reverts it to the non-in depth version. So, I'm thinking that if I want to keep access to the theoretical sleep stages, I have to just take into consideration that it cannot account for my sleep latency as well as my sleep stages. Or maybe I'm doing something wrong? I suppose it doesn't really matter. I just felt like there should be a way to have both.
Thanks for your help xx
MotionX sleep has a great Smart Alarm feature that is customizable as well. I do not believe it can be controlled by the Surge, so you'll have to out your phone in bed with you. It uses the accelerometer of the phone to detect light sleep and wakes you within a defined range around the time you set your alarm. Prior to getting the Surge, this is the way a tracked and analyzed my sleep patterns.
Hi,I've been using my Alta HR for almost a week now but am puzzled about the sleep info. From what I'm reading it's supposed to be possible to see benchmarks based on your gender and age but I can't figure out how or where to see this info. Does anyone know?  The example in the Help article here: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163 lists a woman of indefinite age and says her benchmarks are:Awake: 5-15%REM: 15-25%Light: 50-60%Deep: 12-22% The problem is I have no clue how to find that screen in Dashboard. I've looked at the data for each day - and copied it into an Excel spreadsheet to get my own averages:Awake: 15%REM: 15%Light: 50%Deep: 20% While these are within the example benchmarks (just), I'm probably not the same age, and at least as importantly, I'm not female. From my reading REM sleep is typically 20-25% in adults whereas the example says 15-25% so I'm probably on the low side. I've averaged about 7 hours of sleep a night - again only just within benchmarks, with another hour wasted as Awake - I'm also waking 30 times a night on average. There's nothing that's glaringly problematic at this stage - largely because I'm so ignorant, but I do wonder about the proportion of REM sleep I'm getting and how often I'm waking each night. Having benchmarks to see if I fall within the average range would definitely be useful!!! On a side note the Today button is always greyed out. I'm not sure if that's because I have sync issues - still waiting for the complimentary dongle from Fitbit. I presume it will only become available once I have the ability to sync after waking. Any and all advice will be appreciated.
Any update on getting it sorted ?glad I came on here & looked as I thought it was an issue with my watch or how I was wearing it
Hi! I have bruxism but I use a plate that the dentist made me and since using that my sleep quality has improved remarkably! I no longer wake up with headaches or a stiff neck, and there is no way I can sleep without my plate now. My sleep percentage is always around 97% using my fitbit sleep tracker, so I would say the plate definitely works. It is worth investing in one if you don't have one already! 🙂
I've been recovering from covid for about 8 weeks now and my average resting heart rate has gradually come down as I have started to exercise and cope with daily activities. I was in hospital for a month, diagnosed with Tachycardia and lung scarring. I'm pretty mobile around the house now, but do get tired easily, especially mid afternoon oddly! I have only just started to go outdoors for very short walks of a 150m or so as I struggle to walk further without needing a rest. I was told my troubles are not helped by the muscle wastage I had. Recently, my sleeping heart rate has started to drop. My average is now 67 bpm, down from around 76 bpm 2 months ago.At night it can drop as low as 50 bpm, although generally seems to hover around 55-65bpm. I presume this is ok and a sign my health is starting to recover? What is a normal sleeping heart rate?Before all this illness kicked off, I was a fit and healthy 50 year old, who ran and cycled 3-4 times a week, and did lots of walking in between that!
My fitbit one has stopped accurately logging sleep.  It consistently records 0 minutes to fall asleep, 0 times awakened, and 100% sleep efficiency.
It is very easy to see just how good fitbit is at tracking sleep. Don't look at your sleep pattern and see how you feel during the day. I always know I have had more than 90 minutes continuous sleep - which you need to get to REM - by the way I feel. Never been wrong in years of fitbit ownership. I don't take any notice of the percentages as the only key bit of information needed is if you can get to 90 minutes in one go.  Regards  Chris
I always worry about reboots, and what it might erase or delete.  Is there anything to worry about if I needed to reboot?  Thanks.
Hi @SunsetRunner - my heart goes out to you as I can relate to severe sleep issues. I am dx primary insomnia and sleep paralysis based on a sleep study and a 48 hr EEG. That was 5 years ago. The sleep center did not order a MSLT at the time. I personally suspect narcolepsy without cataplexy. I am also dx ADD. Since 2013, I have been dx PTSD and have recurring nightmares that wake me. The frequency of this is upsetting. Awake then asleep and awake again within minutes. I do go right into deep sleep sometimes, and the graph shows I go from REM to awake. It does not show that I go from wake to REM but I am very well aware of when I have sleep paralysis, it has been observed by my bed partner, and I remember it all. It’s completely different than nightmares. I video tape my sleep on occasion and have observed same. The sleep tracking is VERY off with light sleep. I am more times than not awake when’s it thinks I’m in light sleep.  Obviosuly I need another sleep study. Ive been through the ringer and back with sleep specialists and many other doctors. I’m a tough case and would be happy to hear from anyone else who can chime in on any of the above. We have already explored any and all sleep hygiene issues, medications, you name it and my doctors are at a loss. I’m hoping my next sleep study shows narcolepsy. Seems to be the only thing left.  My charts vary but I would be happy to post them just have to figure that out. good luck to all. Also, if anyone knows of a sleep lab anywhere in the US I am willing to travel for the correct dx.  Oh oh and caffeine makes me bonkers 🙂
Since the update I have only received 2 Breathing Rate readings in my app.  One of those looked normal and the other was "0"..  All other readings seem to be recording ok.  Any ideas what the problem might be?
Thanks.
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
I asked because my doctor posed the question to me as if it were a given--that apnea alerts are available and current...and he wears a Fitbit and encouraged me to get one, so I figured he would know...
I had terrible problems for around 4 years, my sleep pattern is still nopt perfect, but I ended up downloading the Calm app on my ipod.  It seems to help a lot, the other thing that is suggested is don't leave the ipod on the table next to you, if possible charge it in another room, the blue light given off by charging phones, ipods, tablets and computers generally keeps you awake. I'm now averaging around 6 hours a night instead of 3, so something's worked!
Some sleep experts will tell you not to wear it at night because they believe it might actually contribute to people waking up by fixating on the number of times they wake up. It's useful, certainly, to know at the beginning and it might confirm some not very good patterns, but it's probably best to ditch the Fitbit if you want to improve your ZZs. Having said that, it was in part because of the very bad news that the Fitbit delivered last year that I stopped drinking caffeine finally -- and started sleeping much better.
I have con drastically from 2-3 hours sleep per night to 8, looks like therestless times are not being subtracted. I keep my fitbit on sensitive.
Is it working now? My charge 2 stopped giving me sleep stages about a month ago. I've tried everything I can think of.
Hi @JeanetteLM, A good place to start is  selecting the Benchmark tab in the app. That will show you how you compare to others of your  gender and age.

It merely means no or very few movements were registered. I'm speculating that the Fitbit technology doesn't take REM sleep into account and, after going through testing for sleep apnea and being hooked up to over 30 different monitors, that the sleep tracker is rudimentary and IMHO should be viewed as a useful tool, not the end all and be all of sleep efficiency.
Nope. Hours slept, sleep schedule and times awake is all I get.
I know your looking for a snoring app but you might want to to check if UK version of Versa 2 can download the beta version of the snoring detection app.  I am in US & use Versa 2 with the beta snoring detection application.

Was I sleep walking? 44 steps is like from my bed to the fridge.Woke up this morning at 6:30 after going to bed around 11:30 last night.I have no recollecting of walking.
As far am aware there aren't recommendations for this @TraciBru When being restless alot it can indicate that it can be a bit cold or to warm.. There can be lots of noises, or being sick without knowing like having a fever.. It's also possible being worried about something and unconsciously it can make your body being restless alot..
I sleep less than 5 hours each day... make that 3 (usually 2 and some). I know it's a really bad thing and I should be getting a lot more sleep than what I'm getting; but I can't seem to wind down.  All of a sudden is 11pm and I'm still due to wake up at 2.30am. 
 
Then I end up grumpy, drinking more coffee and sweets than I should; then I aim to go to bed early the next day; so I start prepping up my things and... 11pm hits again.  I really wish I was kidding: 

 
So I really need your help; what are the best tips on how to wind down for bed? Should I take a sleeping pill to (kind of) force myself to sleep? I've found a couple tips on a Buzzfeed article and I might try some of them (the least embarrassing though) . Tell me what you think of these: 
 

Imagine that you are powering down your body, part by part.
Try a structured breathing technique to help you relax.
Listen to audiobook versions of childhood favorites.
Do something creative like doodling, coloring, or journaling.
Keep a notepad by your bed to jot down repetitive thoughts.

 
 What are your tips for those times you can't fall asleep?

Fitbit versa
@olledejong   In your initial post you gave time asleep, time in bed, and minutes to fall asleep data.  This data is used for your Inspire HR sleep score and accounts for 50% of the score you see each day.  In an old post, when a user asked about the sleep efficiency equation, a Fitbit Developer said that the equation is proprietary. You sleep score uses your sleeping heart rate, not your resting heart rate.  I pointed this out in my second response. If you want more detail about your sleep, then you should purchase the Premium subscription.  You will get the information as shown in my screenshot.  The premium subscription includes your sleeping heart rate.  But you will still spin your wheels trying to analyze this, though maybe not as much.  In the end your sleep score is derived using proprietary equations and algorithms.

My new Inspire 2 shows a delay for :60+ for my starting sleep time. I peaked at my watch as a lay down to sleep, it was 10:30...I'm not positive but pretty sure I normally fell a sleep in a few minutes. (I certainly didn't lay awake a long time) in the morning the sleep stages showed my going to sleep around 11:45 .... a full :75 minutes after I had gone to bed (and to sleep) What do ya'll think about dealing with this?

Thanks for your reply.  Yeah I get what you're saying about Fitbit not being designed for this purpose, but it is mostly for my own peace of mind.  I certainly haven't been advised by anyone to invest in any specialist medical equipment, I just though that devices that have heart tracking already may be able to go one step further and detect sudden changes in heart rate and send an instant notification. Seems like a missed opportunity to me.
Look at your daily heart rate graph on the fitbit.com dashboard to see if you are getting uninterrupted heart rate readings throughout the night. Here are the other suggestions, which you might have already tried:Why don't I see sleep stages today?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I sleep at least 7 hours a night.  It did give me the sleep stages last night. Sent from my Verizon, Samsung Galaxy smartphone
@shipoThanks for chiming in even if down the road. Indeed your O2 variations look really high and all over the place without your CPAP.  You most likely are correct that it's possibly a matter of life and death for you in those ranges and over time.  I'm a Green Bay Packer fan and I remember when the legendary Reggie White passed at the way too young age of 43.  His wife and loved ones were sure his cardiac arrhythmia was in part due to his untreated sleep apnea.  I appreciate your info and the screenshots a great deal as they help me gauge my situation a bit better. I've been watching my Fitbit estimated O2 variation graph daily and have never seen anything like yours and that high or wild.  This helps to confirm my belief I probably do not have major obstructive sleep apnea.  The only times I see fitbit "high" O2 estimates is if I imbibe a little too much which is nowhere near as often as it used to be or as often as I'd like it to be. Ha!  I wonder if the green tea you drink at night is caffeinated?  One of some long bad habits I've been able to curtail or quit in the last year is Vodka & Sugar Free Red Bulls as my once cocktail of choice.  These drinks would be in the evening or always after 2pm and I now realize how much the Red Bulls had a huge negative impact on my quality of sleep.  Getting off of the energy drinks (and the booze) was a real bear, but I realized it had to be done.  These days it's a Fat Tire or some sort of Amber Ale or 2 (at most 3 on a Saturday evening) and usually only on Friday and Saturday nights.  A few beers do impact my sleep as it seems does all alcohol for most, but not anything major as long as I truly practice moderation and also hydration. Anyway just a friendly thought that if the tea you drink does have caffeine, cutting that out or down a good bit would most likely make a huge positive impact on your sleep and O2 levels.  You probably realize that and I do understand we all have our "treats" that make life worth living and that are non-negotiable, so no judgement here.  Again thanks for your response and sharing your info and data and situation.  Cheers!  ~Tommy
Here's mine... I usually feel 'OK' when I wake up... I seriously feel for you guys getting less sleep than me 😞 I might set mine to sensitive and see what happens!
Hi @DHarker Welcome to the forum. I occasionally have the same issue. A quick fix if to go to your dashboard, delete the sleep that auto logged, and then manual add the sleep back in (start and end time) and Fitbit will then populate the data. I'm not sure why this works, but it does and has for several others experiencing the same issue. Fingers crossed it works for you too.

I'm trying to track my sleep. On the faq for the app, it says to push the menu button on the top left side. I don't have a menu button. The button there says dashboard and when I click on it, it says my options are dashboard and friends. Any ideas?
Thanks for the info. I may have to change my tracker to another model!!
lol, I know all about that 😉 What you could do if that happens is follow the instructions for when you forgot to activate sleep mode. I wore my tracker to bed, but forgot to activate Sleep ModeAs long as you were wearing your tracker while sleeping, your sleep data is not lost. You can manually log your sleep using the following steps:1 .Sign into your Fitbit Dashboard.2 .Click Log Activity, then select the Sleep tab.3 .Enter the date and time you went to bed. Use the previous day drop-down option if you went to bed before midnight and the same day option if you went to bed after midnight.4 .You also have the option to choose 12 hr if you want to enter your time in AM/PM format, or 24 hr if you prefer Military Time.5 .Click Log Sleep to create the sleep log.Once you sync your tracker, your sleep information will be visible on your Dashboard just as though you had activated Sleep Mode.
Hello @Steve2744. Welcome to the community forums! 
 
Thank you very much for taking the time to share your input. I agree with you, but for some reason vigorous exercise has worked for some users too. Interesting! 🤔😊
 
@alexthecat Thank you so much for sharing your favorite workouts! I like biking too but I don't practice it too often. 😣
 
See you around.

This happens to me sometimes. What I do is edit the log so that the start time is when I fell asleep and the end time is when I woke up. The new log will then show all my sleep time (including time awake) in one log with a single score. This also works for nights when the app only displays partial data. For night when the app displays no data at all, I have found the creating a new long with my approximate sleep and wake time will cause the app to display all the data it has for that period.The Fitbit device apparently collects sleep data reliably, but does not reliably display it in the app. Clearly, there a bug in the software somewhere.I'm using a Charge 4, FYI.

In Melbourne, Downunder we have had 3 Summer heat waves, with yesterday getting to 42oC (107oF) and today it is a mere 19oC (66oF) after getting to 37oC (98oF) at midday. The peaks below represent our gradually higher days of temperature and then the peak..  It was 30oC (88oF) while we slept last night. As I'm typing this the HR is 56 bpm on the Charge HR.

Will check on other smartwatches if this is not discontinued soon. Health, more/less need for sleep, work time, etc. Should have an opt out option, even a toggle switch like they have for other items on the dashboard.
Remember that the longer you take to fall asleep and the longer you stay awake while still in sleep mode, the lower your efficiency percentage will be, meaning that it's not even a halfway accurate gauge for your actual sleep.I suggest going over your sleep hygiene first and foremost. Can you improve on any points?If you have any naps during the day, stop it, no matter how tired you are at the time.Set yourself a time to sleep (about 8-9 hours). At your set bedtime, go to bed, no excuses. If you're awake for over an hour without getting to sleep, get up again and do something calming (have a cup of tea, read a book, take a walk, whatever, but avoid screens of all kinds). Repeat if needed, but when your set bedtime is up, get out of bed and do not go there until bedtime comes around again.Limit or cut out caffeine, no caffeine in the last 6 hours before bedtime. If you smoke, don't do it in the last hour before bedtime and try not to if you have to get up.I've had issues with sleep for years and I know how hard it is to live in a fatigued state, but don't give up on it. It's something that needs to be worked on..Good luck!
Last night I was asleep for 8 hours and 36 minutes. (Goal is 8 hours 40 minutes) My “time asleep” score was 36/50. I don’t understand! I could sleep for 9 hours and never get a good sleep score... any insight into how this is calculated?
I work the graveyard too. 10PM to 6:30AM. I sleep like a baby usually 10AM to 2PM. Fitbit seems to record me well. I woke up once during my sleep for a package delivery and it recorded the accurate time.
Found it, thanks!  I have been using the taps for sleep mode, but I am not sure it's all that accurate...so wanted to see that %! Thanks again!
This has been the most useful aspect of fitbit for me, it helped me to see why I woke up tired every morning. I assumed I was getting enough sleep, just poor quality. But once fitbit started to log it - I discovered I was only getting between 5-6.5hrs each night. The quality was fine, I just wasn't going to be early enough! And I love the vibrating alarms - I have a plethora of the set thruout the day as reminders aswell. I lost my fitbit for few days, and tried to wear a regular watch in the interm. The time didn't glow in the dark, and the alarm was loud (not vibrating) and only one per day. Lucky for me, I found my fitbit again!
@mechanesthesiaLet's make positive use of your findings and make this a better product. here is the link for Fitbit Support the Link and they will pass it onto the engineers. Why not put your suggestion into the Product features because I find Fitbit proactive, takes time, but it happens, and based on the lack of number of requests to add multiple sleeps Fitbit need something to push the design priorities up the list.

@dingy  The vibration is short and not always noticeable for some people. You can check and see if your sleep was logged on your dashboard. If you were still in sleep mode or hadn't entered into sleep mode, there would be no record of it in today's log. We'll figure it out. Welcome to the forums.

So i just bought my Charge 2 and it looks like it is correctly identifying when i am going to sleep and i have the chart showing the different cycles but the bar graph below the sleeping chat just shows 0% in every category. As in, 0% awake, 0% REM, 0% Deep Sleep, etc. Does anyone know why this could be?

I have severe sleep apnea and if i do not wear my mask the watch barely wants to track my sleep. With the sleep apnea device it would look something like those graphs if the mast isnt tight or i am restless. So it could be mild sleep apnea or just restless sleeping which could show the same.
@OLICOLLI wrote:Good morning, I've only been wearing my fitbit ionic for 2 days (love it already), but on recording my sleep on the first night it showed a graph with the sleep stages, for some reason on recording my sleep last night it will only now show the data as a sleep pattern, I like the sleep stages? why did it change? Could somebody explain this to me please, I'm really driven to improve my sleep! xHi @OLICOLLI. Sometimes when it can't get your heart rate throughout the night, it will go back to the prior sleep pattern. If this is the case, you'll see a warning in the app about it. If there's no warning about heart rate, then I would do the following: Log out of app.Restart the Ionic (hold left and lower buttons for 10sec + until Fitbit logo appears)Log back in app. Let me know if those fix it for you. Maybe once a month I'll get the old style sleep tracking, usually from losing heart rate during the night.

Those look my my results too---restless 26-29 times per night....I do NOT wake up feeling refreshed & have no energy during the day.  On a "good" nights' sleep for me (less than restless 14X) I see a period or 2 where I sleep well for 1 1/2 to 2 hours uninterrupted- when this happens I wake up feeling energetic and ready to take on the day......I have been reading about sleep cycles and they are about 90 min. long with the most benefit (to restorative health) comes in the last 10 mins of that cycle, so this explains why the 1 1/2- 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep makes me feel more energetic.......you are not alone!!!
Doing a bunch of cardio can help. Some people do better with doing it at night, others in the morning. If you wear yourself out enough, it can help with sleep.Since this has been a long-time issue, getting a sleep study done might help if you haven't had one already.

I am writing with a suggestion for the Fitbit developers.  Currently there is an option to block notifications during a select time frame, which is a convenient feature. However, in addition to that option I suggest that since Fitbit knows when I fall asleep it should automatically block notifications when it senses I am sleeping and automatically resume notifications when I am awake. That way you do not have to remember to turn it on and off each day.

@modelinafatgirl: Research shows not enough sleep leads to weight gain. It lowers your energy level and boosts hunger and so on. Also it leads to various illness. Check this article. Here is another study done in UK few years ago.  Try to get minimum 7 hours of sleep.

My Fitbit shows me restless 2-4 hours every night, even when it is charging in the wall outlet.   Obviously, the sleep stats are totally inaccurate.
Thanks. I couldn’t find anywhere if the perfect sleep score is 100 or something else. I’m 72, so interrupted sleep is more or less a given, but many times I do get a “good”. Many nights I don’t. I keep working on it. I do check this feature most mornings. Again, thanks! Have a great day!!!KathySent from my iPhone
This is not a Fitbit issue - there are other (women?) all saying same thing. I wake up feeling exhausted because of this… i swopped  to an Oura ring at one point and it showed the same issue.!i am trying to get any doctor to take me seriously on this: no one seems to think it’s an issue, but it is an issue. Poor sleep links to so many other chronic health issues. I’m planning on going back to the GP and trying to insist they refer me to a sleep clinic.if at least one of us can get answers it may solve the mystery for all.ps… the only possible theory I found is that it’s caused my longstanding anxiety.I had burn out 15 years ago and I’m wondering if it reprogrammed my anxiety response and I’m now in some kind of permanent state physically.i don’t feel overly stressed - at least not every single day … but maybe I’m just used to it now.have you suffered from anxiety?
@chrama2010 Sleep Mode does not affect the times your Fitbit records sleep (so putting it in Sleep Mode will not make it record your time as asleep).  It is a setting that turns off notifications, your screen is dimmed, and it won't illuminate your screen if you move your wrist in the night.  The Charge 5 manual explains it here.  You can also set a Sleep Mode schedule, which is what I do. I am a restless sleeper, but mine usually records my sleep fairly accurately.  Sometimes it thinks I'm asleep when I'm really just in bed reading or scrolling on my phone.  I adjust my sleep log in the app when that happens. What is your sleep sensitivity set to?  You can find this in the app by selecting your profile photo in the upper left hand corner > scroll down to Activity & Wellness > Sleep. I'm also wondering if your heart rate doesn't get low enough for it to think you're asleep.  What is your resting heart rate?

No it's still about the same.
I'm a night-showerer who doesn't believe in technology in my bedroom (save the alarm clock). I sleep in a slightly cold room that I air during the day and at night if the temperature is above ~58*F/15*C. If those tricks actually work and my sleep seems disturbed now, then I can't imagine what it could be!

I was in a similar situation, sleeping only 3 to 4 hours.  I found out I have adrenal fatigue. I have made some changes in my diet and I am taking some supplements suggested in the Diet Cure by Julia Ross. Now, I am able to sleep 7 hours. This is a great improvement from a month ago.  I am working my way to 8 hours!You can take the symptoms’ questionnaire of the Diet Cure and see if a change in diet could help. http://www.dietcure.com/take_the_quick_symptoms_questionnaire.html
Try manually editing your sleep log to show the correct wakeup time. When I do this, the app will recover the data it didn't display. So if, for example, your real wakeup time was 9 am, edit the sleep log to show that and save it. You should then see your full sleep data. This works with my Charge 4, anyway.
My fit bit flex has not been showing minutes to fall asleep like it did when I first got it does not seem to mater if I have the tracker in sleep mode or not. It does show times awake, times restless/awake and total time restless/awake in minutes as well as total sleep time. I dont recall changing anything any idea how to fix?
Isince December 27, 2019, until January 24, 2020, I was able to see my oxygen variation. As of yesterday, such chart is no longer visible on my smartwatch and check it in the morning .  I can no longer see the current nor past graph.I spoke with Germaine  yesterday. He had me do a reset on my smartwatch. I did. My oxygen chart is still not visible.Please help.
Is there a way to pull up your AFIB notifications on the computer so you can print them out?
I think it depends on if you have a HR Fitbit or not.  If you don't, it just measures if you're moving or not.  If you do have HR, it takes your heart rate into consideration as well (lower heartrate = sleeping).I found the non-HRs to not be super accurate on sleep.
Hi @FredBloggs Welcome to the forums. Yes, sometimes if you are still for a long period of time and your heart rate is steady, your Fitbit will track it as sleep. I occasionally have that happen when I attend long meetings (always fun to tell the meeting organizer later that the meeting was a dud because Fitbit thought I was a sleep. LOL). You can edit your tracked sleep to remove your movie time to have a more accurate representation of your sleep time. How was the movie?

	FitBit Charge 2, Previous Charge HR
Hello:
 
   My sleep patterns are horrible. So, when I recently got this new Sense watch; I have been trying to get better sleep. Finally, getting around to being able to wear the watch during the evening (never wore a watch in my life till now and have difficultly wearing it constantly esp. while sleeping). Last evening I slept for 5 hr 7 min. 
 
With the following info:
 

21min Awake
18min REM
65% 3hr 34min Light
22% 1hr 15min Deep

Besides the measly amount of time that I was able to sleep; my general question is what should be the percentages for quality sleep. I.E.

should I have 50% plus Deep?
How much REM?
How about Light?
Ect?

Are there any general rules of percentages? 
 
Thanks
T

When you are ready to go to sleep.
Hi @MDadourian I have just realised my sleep is on normal sensitivity.. oops! Yeah I have the issue where my appearance can be completely deceiving. I get remarks that I must be really fit but I'm really not. I struggle with breathing, running style but slowly getting back into it. Well the run club I go to is connected to my gym and we do lots of different types of running. The other night we did resisitance and I always love that. I like sprinting too, however that was a reason that put me off running for a while. I can sprint but I fear the damaging consequences afterwards. I did think about joining a run club, but I am paying enough for my gym at the moment so will stick with that for now.  But yes, I get a lot out of my gym classes and I was so pumped after yesterdays run club I found it very hard to settle down and get to sleep to the point that this morning I struggled with the will power to get up. I even fantasized about going for a run at 7AM before getting ready for work. In reality that would just not happen at the moment.  I've created a solution to avoiding the computer in the evenings but reading about fitness: Reading a book on "The Art of Running Faster" instead of being on the computer, so I am reading up on fitness aka my obsession but improving my sleep. I have wanted to buy a book on fitness but my flatmate who is very fitness orientated also made a point that not all books should be trusted when it comes to fitness? He lent me this one so I will give it a read and work on my running ability.

Hey guys, I have been waking up constantly feeling exhausted. I’ve been tracking my heart rate during sleep and over half the time my heart rate is above my resting rate. Does anyone have any tips or tricks to help?
I'm concerned about a 42 bpm should I be?It’s really something that should be adjudicated by a medical professional, not by the collective wisdom of the Fitbit community.

I know I’m late Replying to this thread but wanted to share. Last night my REM sleep was more than double what I usually average. I vividly remember several different dreams which is a little unusual, so it prompted me to evaluate what was different about last night. Two things came to mind. First, I ate spaghetti for dinner, not that unusual, but a little unusual for me, not a huge spaghetti fan. I’ll admit I was sure the spaghetti sauce was the culprit given it has a reputation for causing nightmares/ weird dreams, Then I remembered I took a melatonin before before bed to help me fall asleep. After a quick Google search I found that studies have been shown to increase REM sleep! Anyhoo, just thought it worth sharing.
Until now efficient narcolepsy treatments have been few and far between. Currently there is a new therapy for narcolepsy which is verifying very successful.As you might or might not know, up previously there have not been several very successful therapies for narcolepsy. The only narcolepsy therapy that has actually shown relatively effective are medicated dosages of dexamphetamine.
Narcolepsy Treatments With Dexamphetamine
Up until a couple of years ago the preferred and virtually the only treatment for narcolepsy has actually been with everyday dosages of dexamphetamine. Dexamphetamine is an energizer that requires the body to be conscious by amazing dopamine receptors.
The problem with this therapy is that dexamphetamine is:
1) Highly addicting2) Produces bliss as well as a 'high'.3) Builds tolerance rapidly.Therefore, narcoleptic users find themselves requiring higher and greater doses to get the very same revitalizing results and maintain themselves awake.Narcolepsy Treatments Turned Ugly - Be Alerted.An additional terrible negative effects of this narcoleptic therapy is that since the brain's reward system is hooked up with dopamine, as well as narcoleptics hammer this day-to-day with dexamphetamine, they find themselves incapable to genuinely delight in life or receive real positive feelings of success ...Forever.Because dexamphetamine really overexcites and kills the neurons the problem lasts forever. This is compounded by the reality that everyday, long-term use dexamphetamine is called for as the therapy for narcoleptics.The Narcoleptic Final notice.Consequently, until now, narcoleptics have had a rather grim last offer:.- Either you spend your whole life being tired as well as sleeping every which way, or.- You remain awake as well as enjoy your life for some time, yet then have your brain burnt out and never have the ability to take pleasure in anything ever before once again!As well as this is a truly tough decision to make.Brand-new Narcoleptic Treatments Discovered.Now there is a new narcoleptic treatment obtaining momentum in the medical field. A new medicine called modafinil was found a few years back and also it is now on the marketplace as a therapy for narcolepsy.The medication operates in a different way to dexamphetamine. Rather than 'exciting the stimulating parts of the brain' rather it straightforward 'switches off the sleepy part of the brain'. That has to do with the simplest means to describe it without going into details.Modafinil As A Treatment For Narcolepsy.Currently modafinil is the premium narcolepsy therapy for numerous reasons:.- it's non-addictive.- it does not develop euphoria or a 'high'.- it has a long half life of 12-15 hrs (this implies you just need to take one dose in the morning).- it doesn't 'melt the brain out' as well as customers can terminate and feel typical right away.- it's cheap since reduced dosages are needed much less frequently.- there is no possibility for abuse capacity (unlike dexamphetamine which has a huge abuse possibility).So as you can see, it's light-years ahead of any other narcoleptic therapy.Narcolepsy Therapies - The Best Of The very best.Modafinil   is the most effective of the very best when it concerns narcolepsy treatments.

I have this same issue -- it's not accurate.  Everyday I have to "add" in sleep time after I've gotten up to let dog out and gone back to bed.  But I don't know why I even do it -- because the tracker doesn't change.  It records the time I put in on the summary page, but shows nothing on the sleep graph.  It doesn't even revert back to the basic sleep graph.  It just shows the time before I got up and then nothing afterward ... except on rare occasions like this morning where it recorded an hour of light sleep ... when I was sitting at my desk, reading my email.
Apparently there has been a change on how we see our sleep score on our apps. It has become overly simplified. Has the ability to expand the bar graphs disappeared and see when I was awake and how fast I fell into deep sleep? That was one of my favorite features

I just updated my Fitbit and my sleep tracking disappeared and all of my data!!!! Please advise how to get sleep back. My dashboard appearance also changed and other elements are missing like the ability to sync now.
This happens to me almost every night!  What helps me to "calm" my overactive night-owl of a brain is counting backwards. I start at 1,ooo and count down, while doing this in my mind I will also try to visualize what each number looks like as I count them down.  Usually by the time I get to the 600's I'll catch myself counting the same number over and over a few times.  That's when I realize that I actually fell asleep and wasn't aware of it, lol. Unfortunately, there have also been rare times (under extreme stress) where I've made it all the way to zero and had to start counting back up to 1,000.  So this method really only works for general overthinking at night.  😕
I routinely get a sleep efficiency of 90% or more. I've been tracking it for almost two months now. I sleep with two dogs that wake me up at least once a night and I get up to go to the bathroom at least once a night.
Didn't receive sleep stages this morning. Instead there was a simplified display without stage detail. My Charge 4 has been doing fine for weeks. Why the unexpected change?

Do not use 'Begin Sleep Now' and 'I'm Awake'. ???Where do I find those...at least to make sure they are turned off please
Hello mate. Mine was cured by fully charging my Fitbit. I thought it would be fine as it showed 15% battery life but unfortunately no. It can't Tesco properly with such s low charge.
Mine varies.  I've never been a good sleeper.  I wake up several times during the night and of couse I move around.....well, that's going to show as being restless.  I've been as low as 8 X and as many as 20 X.  I've been curious as what is normal for others too.
I have the same problem.  I suffer terribly from insomnia - husband doesn't help with his laptop on til all hours and then waking me up on his toilet trips and once woken I can't get back to sleep, sometimes for 2 or 3 hours.  I often wake up shattered, even if my Fitbit says I've had 7+ hours sleep.  It always shows so little deep sleep that it doesn't even give it a percentage on the "benchmarking" tab.  I get little R.E.M sleep either, I'm either awake or in light sleep,  I used to sleep like a log for 9 hours a night, but since having children I wake at the slightest thing.  They are almost grown up now, and I suspect the problem may be stress related with work, and or peri menopause.  I wondered about the Dr but suspect they will either give me tablets and I will feel worse, or tell me to put up with it as sleep is sleep, deep or otherwise.  It's affecting my ability to function and I worry I'm not safe to drive I get so tired.  Help!!
Hi @Kyleer I'm sorry to hear you are having an issue with tracking your sleep. Have you tried deleting the auto tracking data and manually entering the start and end time of sleep? Occasionally I have an issue with sleep data and deleting and manually entering start and end fix the issues. The system information will populate with you manually enter the start and end. I also find if I have to do this a couple of time, the issue doesn't persist and every thing works correctly. I hope that helps.

A year later and they still haven’t made a wake up light lamp?
Hello MatthewFIT! Thanks for the update on the sleep stages "temporary outage" issue. However, by the number of comments out here, there are still additional sleep stage problems.I have had sleep stages for the last week now. Fingers crossed. But today when I edited my sleep log to remove an extraneous two hour segment on the end… all my sleep stages disappeared. I have edited sleep logs before and that has never happened. It is still unstable.There are definitely problems beyond the 'temporary outage' fix you cited. I have been referred to the article you cited several times… none of the conditions within the article are relevant to the problems I have had. It is beyond that.Sleep stages worked beautifully/perfectly for about six months after I got my Fitbit. It's a great feature and I realize it's new technology... and it's amazing. It does seem that fixes are being applied, and I am trying to be patient because I love this feature.However, it would be a lot less frustrating, if Fitbit wouldn't keep claiming that things are "completely resolved"… when they're actually not yet. Just let us know the status, so we know Fitbit is aware and working on it.Thank you for monitoring the situation and keeping us updated so far.
Since last week my afternoon sleeping pattern is not getting recorded. The night sleep records are absolutely perfect.
Here's where I am at. In September of last year, I went to my (family) doctor and complained of gaining weight and severe insomnia. He recommended a sleep study for apnea, and suggested the apnea was the cause of both. He said the body awakens itself as a method of staying alive when it's starved for oxygen. Had the sleep study done, it showed 117 times of stop breathing per hour, with my blood oxygen dropping to 60%. Was ordered a CPAP. I had it two weeks when I went to see my sleep doctor again. Enter my FitBit. I knew the CPAP was making things loads better, but I was still having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I told my doctor this, and used my FitBit information as a way of backing up the problems I was still having. He believed me. Now, I don't know if believed me because he had my sleep data from my sleep study and sleep data from my CPAP (it also records nightly) and this was just something that fit the existing picture, but I know I had a hard time of (doctors) taking my sleep issues seriously before my sleep study. That may be what some of you are seeing with your doctors blowing the FitBit information off. For YEARS, every surgery or survey on "snoring and apnea" highlighted the fact that I HAD apnea, but it took a severe event before I was actually sent to a sleep study!!! The sleep studies are expensive, and my first insurance company didn't want to pay for it, but we switched insurances after the first of the year and they paid for the full study. So yeah, it took a long time before my doctors took my sleep issues seriously- far too long.
Hello @Sleepmaster12, welcome to the community forums! 
 
Note that you can set a sleep goal and maintain consistent sleep patterns. You can set either a bedtime or a wake-up time target, or set both targets. For more information about sleep, please check here: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
You can also review this link to see which health and fitness goals you can track with your Fitbit device. Also, in this blog you can get more information about how to effectively sleep. 
 
Hope this helps!

My charge 2 detects and tracks naps, but unless the sleep is over 3 hours long, it won't show sleep stages. I believe this is the same with other Fitbit trackers.

I have revised my sleep efficiency calculation as follows;1. From your sleep chart, add-up your 'humps' when you were awake, In the image file, The hump I have selected is from (1:24 - 1:32 - 8 min) . The sum of these humps ignores the 'dots' of 1 minute awake times, which I consider to be movements I make whilst still asleep.2. Divide the sum from step #1 from your "time asleep" (, which is really your time in bed with intent to sleep).  Multiply this decimal by 100 for a percentage. The result is a percentage of your time awake to your time with intent to sleep.3. Subtract the percentage from step #2 from 100. The result is the time that you were actually asleep to your your time with intent to sleep.  I find this useful as it shows me how efficient my allocated sleep time is.  My average "time with intent to sleep" is 5.5 hours a night.  Using this method my sleep efficiency is always over 95%.   Why sleep longer when you can sleep better for shorter durations?  🙂
That EDIT/UPDATE thing works. But it looks like I'll have to do that for every day. Seems like something needs to be fixed in the code. It also doesn't explain why the calculation on my Windows Phone app is different than on the web. Sure seems like they should be working with the same data. Web = 4:08 last night. App = 4:24. Even the Restless counts are different. What gives?
I was wondering this also. It was free now we have to pay?  Time to go to Apple Watch I guess!!
hello, u wonder why my sleep log had diffrent times in the same night-ucing te sencetive tracking mode. i did for d first time start the tracking from  my app , and was "pushing the button" i am awake and it said 4h.24 minits    and  than later when i was looking agin at it was 2h.4 min. .I do not understrand why it is difrent? when it is the same log? sorry aboute my writing skillis maby not so good.
I have my settings on "normal" and I typically get around 7 hours of sleep, but I'm in bed for eight-eight and a half depending on the schedule.  If I get a 98% I feel more refreshed than if I get a 93%, so I'm pretty sure the "normal" setting is correct for me.  I always get up at least once during the night -- I'm 67 and taking a diuretic -- so I have never had anything higher than 98%.
How do you check you HR for during sleep? I would be interested to see mine. I have trouble with naps too and rarely take them. I wake up at 5:30 am and go to bed about 9:40. 4 o'clock I would be falling asleep too! I fall asleep during action movies because I find them so boring if they don't have a plot haha Oh wow haha I have some sort of allergy to caffeine
I have seen some mentions and screenshots of a Restoration Score in the app, but I cannot find this in my app (as described here).  I am only able to see my final Sleep Score, not the breakdown.  Is the Restoration Score only available for Premium subscribers?  I'm located in Canada, so it's also possible that these features are not rolled out here.  Can anyone confirm? I have a Charge 3 with app version 3.14 on Android.

I wear the One clipped to my t-shirt at the neck (avoids having to keep taking it in and out of the armband). On 'normal' sensitivity it would often report 0 times awake, and <5 minutes to get to sleep (100% efficient) ... I changed to 'Sensitive' and it shows ~15-20 mins to get to sleep, and 'waking' about 10 times with some quite long restless periods. I can't get too hung up on 'what others record' and feel that these numbers just have to be used as a personal comparison from one day to the next.
My average is 27.
I started sleep tracking on normal and then i played a game on my phone for an hour in bed. Apparently I've been walking 100 steps and slept. Very confusing!
I just got my fitbit yesterday and thought I had put it into sleep mode last night. I went to take it off of sleep mode and attempted to sync with my phone and  it showed no sleeping log? Maybe i didnt do it right? But it vibrated and showed me the 2 lights everyone is talking about.
Thanks for your response @SunsetRunner. Your response confirms FitBit products do not have the feature I'm looking for. For the sake of FitBit personnel who may read this post, I recognize FitBit's oxygen level monitor is not equivalent to a medical grade device. The FitBit device would not need to be equivalent to a medical grade device to meet my needs. The FitBit can already detect changes in oxygen level. All I need the device to do is to alert me (preferably via vibrating), when it detects a dip in oxygen level. I will enter this feature request in the Feature Suggestions forum. It seems like an incredibly simple feature to implement. FitBit devices can already monitor oxygen levels and they can already vibrate. Why not link the two capacities?
It bewilders me that this still hasn’t been implemented.... floors climbed, active minutes and sleep challenges are a five minute job. They already have the coding set up for steps. Feels v lazy from Fitbit to not implement any of these yet.
On a couple of occasions my wife has noticed one, maybe two, flashing hearts emitting from my Wrist strapped Fitbit Charge 3 during normal night time sleep.I have tried to investigate, to no avail!  Like all Fitbit queries it is left to the community to find/give the answer/s.I hope somebody out there can give some insight into what they mean? JimJak
Reboot is basically like turning it off and turning it back on.Reset is the one you gotta watch out for. That will wipe your data and stuff.There's no reason to fear rebooting if something isn't working.
Sounds like nonsense to me. Lots of people sleep with the AC on and sometimes a fan as well. (Including me.) The only valid concern I've ever heard on this subject is if you have allergies. Then there is a concern that a fan my just stir up dust and make it hard on your sinuses. Whatever makes you more comfortable and get the best sleep is what is right for you.
Last i checked, alcohol is a drug, and yes it affects sleep.
So, I have no idea how to improve my sleep. Has anyone changed their mattress and greatly improved their time asleep?My sleep time ranges from 1hr, 44 min today (!!!) to almost 4 hours, and that was when I was in bed for almost 9 hours. Average is about 2 1/2 hours of sleep. I'm kind of at a loss on what to do about this. I exercise, have cut down my caffeine to 1 cup of coffee first thing in the morning, but I always feel tired and generally crappy. I am mildly depressed, but I have a very busy job and busy life, with great kids and a supportive husband, so I don't think about it or spend much time dwelling on it. I am 41, am 10 pounds overweight, but eating healthy and plan to lose it in the next few months, and I have no health problems. No one in my family has ever had sleep apnea. I have no health insurance, so a sleep study is not an option and I'm unwilling and cannot afford to take medication or wear CPAP, so I don't know what a sleep study would even tell me that would help. I think my mattress is really, really uncomfortable, but it is almost 10 years old and I guess I don't want to spend $1,000 and find out it doesn't change anything. I think I am depressed about these poor sleep numbers since I got my Fitbit for Christmas! When I changed my Fitbit to "sensitive" it basically said I wasn't sleeping at all, but in "normal" I'm still getting less than 4 hours per night, with at least twice that time spent in bed. Just weird to have this tool, but nothing to do to solve it. I plan to slowly eliminate caffeine (trying to avoid the headaches right now), and I am going to increase my exercise as much as my schedule permits. I ran a marathon several months ago, but had to give up many aspects of my life to fit it in, so I really wish I knew if my sleep numbers looked better then. It is not an option for me to exercise that much again due to how much time it took. And I was EXHAUSTED while I was training for that baby, ha!!
@Kathyman1 what device are you using?

Amanda | Wyoming, USA
Yeah, obviously comfort level affects the quality of sleep. Since I developed back pain, this has been highly position dependent for me, as I mentioned. I was just wondering if there are any other factors that could be related to sleeping position, such as breathing/snoring. Maybe worth googling to see any research that might be out there.  Amount of light/deep/awake time reported during sleep is highly device dependent, and "deep" sleep isn't usually differentiated from REM sleep. I personally use a combination of Mi Band 2 (similar deep sleep %s as fitbit), Misfit Ray (higher %) and the Sleep as Android app (higher still, but includes heart rate data). I've turned into a bit of a sleep data junkie. 🙂  IMHO, sleep quality is highly subjective. Trackers are definitely useful in finding a baseline and working towards making positive changes.
Anybody else wake up today and notice it is the 'old' version that doesn't give much insight?   The sleep stages is the primary reason I use this (next to heart monitor).   Hopefully its 'fixed' soon as the old version doesn't really give much insight.Micah
Why doesn't  my charge here show my sleep score anymore. It hasn't shown it for a week now. It shows sleep time but no score
And thank you!  I always end up over both bars on deep sleep, which according to this site is suppose to help rebuilding/repairing/immune system.  It makes sense that I'd be in repair for so long, since my doctor has been unable to diagnose a health issue I've been dealing with for 5 months.  I have gone through eye pressure tests/emergency room visits/blood work/urine tests/cat scan/MRI/ultra sound, etc.  I've been told it's an infection, it's a vein in my brain, it's stress, it's an infection, it's kidney problems, it's an infection, it's kidney stones, etc. Anyway, glad to hear I'm getting the kind of sleep I need to help repair.
Hi, i found the best way to sleep is to bring foam ear plugs with. the kind that you pinch in your fingers and put in your ears. this will block out a lot of noise but still let you hear if there is an emergency. I also take my shoes off so my feet can help regulate my body temp as i sleep. it sounds strange but i can't sleep with shoes on.
What in the heck happened to the graphs for sleep.. change it back..!
Me too. Since the sleep patterns don’t work and I always get a score of 0, it would be nice to have the average hours of sleep back. This just keeps getting worse.
@JeaKend I don't even know if I could count backwards from 1,000! Haha. I'll have to try that one out next time
@AshMinx  @SunsetRunner   I'm sorry that no one responded to your question.  Your average sleep didn't go away.  It's just not the first screen.  When you open your sleep tile, swipe to the left on the sleep score graph.  Now you will find your Hours Slept.

I have noticed that with the sensitivity setting it shows you get much less sleep. Is sensitivity measuring the times you move in the bed?i am supposing just becuase you move in bed it doesnt necessarily mean you are awake???

Hi @Kellyanne26, The explanation is quality and quantity are not the same thing. You can sleep for 6 hours and get good sleep. Or you could sleep 9 hours and awake a lot during the night and be less rested as a result.

Typical sleep advice tells you to avoid meals before bed. For me, the reverse applies. I can’t sleep if I’m hungry or even a bit snack-y.And I’ve tried all the warm milk, carb-heavy remedies that people often suggest. The only thing that does help? Plain, unsweetened yogurt.
@JohnRi awesome job on your weight accomplishments so far! 
 
I usually get 7-8 hours per night, and then wake up and go for a run in the morning. Most mornings, I wake up before my alarm. The combination of that amount of sleep plus exercising in the morning gives me energy throughout the whole day, and at night I usually fall asleep within 10-15 minutes. I think it's dependent on each individual! 
 
In your situation though, it sounds like your body just doesn't need as much sleep anymore! If you're getting 6 hours of sleep but still waking up full of energy before your alarm goes off, you might just not need as much sleep anymore, so I wouldn't worry too much about not being able to fall asleep. It sounds like exercise is giving you energy, and that's great! Even if the recommended amount for adults is 8 hours, if you feel rested after 6 I think it's quite alright to listen to your body. Of course, if you start feeling tired during the day or start waking up at night, this could be attributed to something more serious and it's time to see the doc!

Hey there @Disha.victor, thanks for stopping by. Thanks for posting your inquiry here.
 
You must see sleep stages in order to see your sleep score information. Are you still having this issues? If you see sleep stages but don’t see a sleep score:
 

Note that it may take a few minutes for your sleep score to appear. 
Update the Fitbit app to the latest version. For instructions, see About the Fitbit app.
Take into consideration the information provided in: Why don't I see sleep stages today?

If your device is still not registering your sleep after reviewing the information above, I recommend trying the following:
 

Manually sync the Fitbit. See instructions in How do Fitbit devices sync their data?
Restart the tracker. See instructions in How do I restart my Fitbit device?
Try sleeping with the tracker on your non-dominant hand.
If steps 1-3 don't work, I suggest manually logging your sleep to reflect the time slept. See instructions in How do I change my sleep history?

 
Give this a go and let me know the outcome. 
 
Hope this helps.

I have read numerous sources which say, "While a resting heart rate of 60-100 is "normal", folks with an RHR in the 80-100 range statistically have a much higher incidence of heart related issues than those below 80, in fact, some maintain 70 or lower is best." Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, director of women's heart health at Lenox Hill Hospital says (paraphrasing here for brevity), "Sixty to one-hundred beats per minute is an old standard; many doctors think it should be lower with fifty to seventy beats per minute being ideal.  While it might be okay to have a resting heart rate of eighty, it doesn't mean your healthy."A study published in the journal Heart tracked the cardiovascular health of about 3,000 men for 16 years and found that a high RHR was linked with lower physical fitness and higher blood pressure, body weight, and levels of circulating blood fats. The researchers also discovered that the higher a person’s RHR, the greater the risk of premature death. Specifically, an RHR between 81 and 90 doubled the chance of death, while an RHR higher than 90 tripled it. http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/features/5-heart-rate-myths-debunked#1https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/resting-heart-rate-can-reflect-current-future-health-20160617980...

Bluetooth emf from the fitbit is not that bad it is very low in fact that they're exempt from the evaluations required for other RF devices like cell phones.   But my concern if for cumulative, wearing it 24/7, since they've added sleep tracking.  I would want to take advantage of that wearing it 24/7.  Samsung gear sport can turn off bluetooth or any signals coming out from the watch but it's horrible at sleep tracking.
Is it tracking your heart rate OK as without this there are no sleep stages? I've had this happen on the odd night when it doesn't pick up HR for whatever reason.

I just used my fitbit one for the first time, normal setting, and it tells me I have been restless 21 times tonight, still efficiency is quite hight at 93%. Is this normal? It seems a lot of restlessness even though the efficiency is high.
The setting for Dominant vs Non-Dominant hand would be more for the step counting, because you would move your dominant arm more when you are not walking (I think). For your sleep tracking, the Fitbit is working off of your movement. On normal it disregards slight movements that show up on the sensitive setting. You can look at the same nights results with both settings from your dashboard, your amount of sleep didn't change, just the amount that it determines you were awake. The only way to determine if you were truely asleep or awake is by measuring brain activity with a sleep test. I have had three sleep studies and in all of them they said that I don't move. Here are my results from last night:SensitiveNormal
I was given Fitbit Alta he for Christmas but am very disappointed that sleep recording not right. I know for a fact I was awake until 3.30 this morning although it recorded me asleep three hours earlier and I slept til 10.30am but records I woke up at 7.35!!  So very disappointed the recording did its own thing and nothing like my sleep
I get something like this once in a while. When it happens, I don't think it's a problem of my sleeping heart rate being too high, but rather my resting heart rate has been incorrectly calculated to be too low. I don't understand how resting heart rate is being calculated and I'm not convinced that it is a reliable number.

I went to the movie yesterday afternoon. When watching sleep stats on my phone today, I noticed the movie watching session was detected as sleep by both my Charge 2 and my Surge (I’m wearing each on a different arm). This is "sleep" from the movie as detected by my Charge 2:  and as detected by my Surge (starting and ending times are slightly different):   And the quality of my "sleep" was perfect according to both! 0 times awake, 0 times restless, 0 minutes awake/restless:  And I swear I stayed awake the entire time of the movie!
@Dominique wrote:@N8teGee : is the 6.1 hr bar that shows on your graph the average hours slept for the week?! On my graph, it’s 7.5 hr, and it’s definitely not average hours slept, but rather the goal I have set.@Dominique Yes I think you are correct. I was initially thrown by the fact that it's displaying time in the decimal format (not sure why there is an inconsistency), but when converted it does seem to be my sleep goal of 6hrs 5mins. So in that case disregard what I said in my previous post, there doesn't appear to be a way to see average sleep duration on the new dashboard.

I've tried a couple of strategies, but I am not yet consistent in putting my Fitbit into sleep monitoring mode.  Any suggestions?
Five days in a row - no sleep stages. I've charged the fitbit, tightened it, nothing. What gives?
I've noticed over time that my sleep quality is getting worse and my sleepis broken into a number of different sized chunks each night. (4 am for meat the moment and I'm wide awake!)I'm trying to get a sense of the average length of these shorter sleepsessions so I can set reasonable expectations for my sleep rather than justget into bed hoping for a full 8 hours then failing dismally.I think this pattern would show up better with the full data set in playrather than just a single week.
sorry.. you can delete this topic.
It's not always going to be 100% accurate. It's not going to start counting immediately once you close your eyes. It still gets the job done good enough.

I turned into the customer service in Twitter for this. And here's a quote@Merkillin It is estimated using your sleeping and waking (at rest) heart rates. Learn more here: https://t.co/KhqkfDgcfs. Hope this helps!And I have just replied..@FitbitSupport actually I'm disagreeing with you. You should not use this term rest log if it has nothing to do with it.You see I've bought the device just to see my hrm:s, and they are not giving me it. It's actually my main concern, to be able to keep track of the hrm:s. I'm not interested in an estimate, I need the exact numberAnd I have replied that I'm actually going to search for a 3rd party apps now for seeing this.
Anyone know of any peer reviewed studies that show that sleep tracking on a fitbit is accurate?  It seems that by tracking movment, you don't get a full picture.
I just started using mine. I have insomnia. The first cycle was 56 mins. The second cycle when I was dead tired showed the stages. I think if the tracker senses too much restless and you never hit REM sleep it shows the old type of view. I could be wrong but that is kind of how the data looked to me.
Hey @poppashark I totally agree with you. I personally would like to have a sleep challenge and a solo challenge. I'm trying to improve my sleep quality and quantity, I think it's important for your health to sleep the recommended hours. But for some of us is really difficult to change routines. What have you tried to improve your sleep quality and quantity?

For the pas eight months or so my sleep patterns have changed. I used to be able to go to sleep and get up with no problems, but now I have a hard time getting to sleep and when I wake up I have an even harder time actually getting up and going. I average about 5-6 hours of sleep a night, which was fine before. Any input would be appreciated
Create an alarm that wakes you up a certain amount of time once you fall asleep. I.e. if you want to take a 30min nap have it go off 30min after you actually fall asleep. Or if you are looking for 8hrs of sleep every night, the alarm can wake you once you’ve hit that point.
Nope. On normal it shows 100% or close to it every night. I definitely know better when I am conscious of being awake several time a night.
Hello, All, I've recently activated the SpO2 clock face on my Fitbit Versa. I can see that my Oxygen level is 92% or 93%. I read that normal range is 95-100%. Should I be worried or see a doctor? Thanks in advance

Hey Emamino88. I suffer from CHRONIC restless nights, 9 hrs of "sleep" usually gets me an average of 3 and a half hours a night. The most common things to help with are excersice, eat right, Melatonin  couple nights a week, calm yourself for at least a hour before bed, etc. I'm sure you've heard most of these. I've found the racing mind problem is a REALLY hard thing to defeat. I'm a war vet, so I constantly find myself planning out hostile situations, hashing out situations in the past I could have handled differently and on and on... It's constant and miserable. The things I've foundhelp the most is, first off, scheduleing. Go to bed the same time every night. When my mind starts racing I try to catch myself before I really get rolling and breathe deeply and try to focus on ONE thing. Find something peaceful you really enjoy. My "happy place" is wood working, I really like carving. So I'll think of a cool pattern and follow it with my eyes, imagine what chisel to use, see the blade curling the wood, etc. Its, for all intents and purposes, meditation ( guess I could have just said that,) but it really helps me get to sleep. The staying asleep is my hard part, but I've heard from alot of Vets that Melatonin helps, but you really should consult a Doc if you wanna start that on a regular basis. Sorry I'm so long winded, but like I said this is a pretty serious problem for me too, so I feel your pain and wanna give ya what I've figured out. Hope it helps man, good luck.
That velcro is horrible.  I have had my fitbit fallout of the sleep band and then had to search through all the sheets and blankets in the morning for it.
I’m on night 3 of using my new Versa 3 and I love it. I love seeing how it tracks your sleep but I’m wondering why there is so many red dots along the top during the night which mean ‘awake’ when I click on each one they are 30 seconds to 1 minute of awake times during the night. does everyone have these? I’ve ready it’s where you may turn over or briefly wake but not remember ‘waking’ but then I’ve also read about sleep apnoea and now I’m worried 😟 Can anyone share there charts and tell me if the red lines/dots are normal? Thanks
Yeah at weekends I go to bed later also but I still wake at the same **ahem**time. I usually have a nap during the day at some stage on weekends whichhelps but it's still annoying. I look at my wife who gets up early duringthe week and could happily sleep to mid day on weekends. Not fair.
I have a similar problem. On 'normal' sensitivity, it reports pretty much unbroken sleep (which I know is untrue, I know I wake up probably 5 or 6 times every night), however on 'sensitive' it reports almost continual restlessness (which I'm also pretty sure is untrue). What I want is a way to alter the sensitivity on a finer scale. I assume it's the software that's filtering the activity based on the sensitivity, not the hardware, so should be possible. Currently the sleep tracking is pretty much useless to me 😞
so after all this study ...........what good is the info I dont see how the fitbit can be any help!!!!!!

I got it a few weeks ago and been wondering the same thing.  My restless percentage so far averages around 10-12%, with a high of 16% and a low of 7%.  I tend to be an active sleeper and sometimes experience restless leg syndrome when trying to fall asleep so I suspect my number is higher than average.  But no idea how to evaluate the numbers.
For comparison's sake, this is a good night.  Mind you, not all of them are like this, but it is pretty typical for me.

+1I really hope fitbit will implement this and just like the OP says, the fuctionality is already in there...you just need to combine the alarm clock and the sleep tracker.Please consider implementing this in a near feature.
I have a Charge 2 that I've had for about 2 years and I absolutely loved the Sleep Tracker when it came out. The past few days, however, the wonderful graph showing from awake then through sleep stages with a bar-chart at the bottom showing percentages of stages has disappeared replaced with just asleep/restless/awake and no tracking. I took a screenshot of the past several days to show the difference, but I'm not seeing how to attach it. These are things I've done to try and resolve the problem: * I reset my Charge 2 by holding the button while in the charger until the Fitbit logo came on, then let it continue charging the battery until full. * I made sure I had the latest update on my LG G3 phone that I use to connect with my Charge 2 and then the internet. When the above failed, I contemplated making a virgin olive-oil sacrifice, but that just made me hungry for some scrambled eggs so I did that instead and I'll omelette you go while I continue to pull out my hair in frustration.

I just compare my nighttime HR plot to my sleep plot; granted each point on the nighttime HR plot represents an average of the previous five minutes, but it does seem to be accurate enough for me (I suffer from severe sleep apnea, mostly controlled by a CPAP device).
@Ari5211  @iTommyBoy   Are either or both of you in the US?  Did you sign up for the v-safe vaccination check ins?  I got my first dose and get my second soon.  I got daily check-ins on my phone with a series of questions.  This is the way that the CDC can monitor for adverse reactions, since it is released on emergency authorization. BTW, my first dose gave me slight nausea later that afternoon that went away after a nap.  My EOV graph was no different after the first dose.  I am definitely going to watch after my second dose! Pfizer or Moderna?  I got Moderna.    @DramaQueenDiva  Did anything like this happen to you?

I was without my Fitbit One for several weeks. Long story; I have it back. I have synced it and it works great tracking my steps, elevation, etc. It will tell me how long I slept but not the sleep stages! Help please.
Thank you for assisting. 😊I believe “sleep statistics” is the same as “sleep stages”.  I can see awake time (minutes) but can not see awake count (number) in the phone apps. Interestingly, while trying to look again. This time I went directly to Fitbit website login via my phone instead of Fitbit app. Here they show what I needed, awake count or times awaken.  Still hope I can get this info in the app itself. first photo is website, and shows awake 23x (times), second photo is app version and does not show time awake, only gives duration time awake.
I have worn mine both ways and currently clip it to my shorts also because the velcro has worn out on the wristband. I've noticed that it doesn't track "restless" or "awake" periods as well because the movements are much smaller compared to when it's on your wrist. Other than that, the sleep times are accurate but I wouldn't take the other measurements too seriously when worn this way. Hope this helps!
Good to know they're working on a fix for the dashboard calculation.Still wondering if they're aware that the Windows Phone App calculates differently.
I only got mr firbit alta hr 3 days ago. 2 days of great sleep insight, REM, Deep and light sleep, then last night it was just awake or sleep. Whats going on? Have i changed something by accident?
Do you take a couple naps a day? I HAVE been on 400mg of provigil and 200mgof nuvigil per day 4 years, Zyrem for Cataplexia and use a dipap machine,had corrective surgery on my nose(boxing), and it's been rough.Recently started Sinosil and believe me, it's better.But unlike you, I am 69 and don't have the responsibilities to keep me fromsleeping if I feel the need. So I think, first you can't drive a car morethan you are able to resist sleep; it's like driving drunk.Even if the law forgives you, you will never be able to escape yourselfshould you kill someone asleep behind the wheel.I think once your children are grown, you will have gained more experienceof how to live with your disability, life will not get harder.For me, I was diagnosed when I was 19( I have had narcolepsy with cataplexyat a very early age), I was not medicated. Years later when I was 38, I wasdiagnosed again and it was determined I was bi-polar,too.The only medicine at the time was Ritalin, and what a nightmare that was.Ifelt like my eyes were opened with clothespins and my moods, let me justsay, I feel so bad and sorry for the people around me.I was like a tornadowrecking everything in my path, whether manic or depressed.Like I said, experience and the luxury of having time unallocated to otherresponsibilities gave me an opportunity to sleep when I needed to and whenI noticed the onset of the bipolar symptoms which are like a brokenrecord,always the same, I would do likewise, retire and sleep it off.What helped me the most was the bipsp machine, you see that's the irony ofnarcolepsy- more sleep doesn't lead to a feeling of being rested and that'sbecause the very nature of narcolepsy involves what they call arousal and Ihad about 67-78 arousal per hour which means you just never get any sleep.It's a good thing REM happens almost immediately otherwise I don't think Icould have made it.But getting back to the Dipap machine, my hourly arousal are now about 17.Yes, I still feel tired but at least I don't feel like I am fighting sleepfrom the minute I wake up and the misery that accompanies that struggleanymore.Hope this can lead you to an answer!
I have both my 'bedtime' and 'wake up time' set and still my sleep log often gets split into two different logs. Is it possible to combine two logs from the same night? Or even better, how can stop this from happening? Thanks, OldMan

Hey @katanel, that's a very good observation! I'll try to change my pillows too, I also use the memory shape ones and that's maybe the reason why I have some days more than 20 restless moments during my sleep.
 
I'll also try to go to sleep at almost the same time every day as @dragonpupps suggested! What I've noticed in the past weeks is that if I don't use my phone, computer or T.V. one hour before go to bed I sleep better and I feel more rest. Thanks for sharing this!

Help!  I finally got my Surge about a week and a half ago after waiting since January 6th.  I was soooo excited.  However, the automatic sleep tracking did not work.  The only way I could get any sleep stats was to manually go in and tell it I was going to sleep.  I know this is a small thing, but one of the main reasons I spent the extra money and upgraded to the Surge.  After working with customer service for a week, they were kind enough to send me a replacement.  I received that yesterday.  Got it all set up and going last night.  I woke up this morning at 7:30 am CST.  It is now 9:57 CST and there is no sleep showing up on my dashboard.  I have synched several times and I also restarted by Surge before going to bed last night.  I know I am not the first to complain of this so is this just a software glitch that will be fixed or do I give up, ask for a refund and try a different tracker?  Ugh......
I have the same thing. It could be the caffeine from my short Google research but as with everything you Google it’s either perfectly normal or you are  dying. Haha. Mom thing I found was to watch the sleep heart rate slope, it should be a slight u shape. A downwards slope could be caused from a late night activity or meal causing your metabolism to be working harder throughout the night.
Mate i have PTSD too. I find grounding excercises when dreams happen and if needed doing a new activity to calm me down helps. I also medite using the Headspace app daily and do yoga 1-2 times aday. I also try to do a relaxing yoga before bed. I have recently included napping which is helping me greatly. I hope my experiance provides ideas for you.

Thank you very much for sharing your experience and the recommendations! 😊 I'll try to put this into practice.
 
I've also heard that aerobic activities, regular resistance exercises can improve sleep quality and other aspects of nightly rest. Strength training can also lower the risk for anxiety and depression.

Thanks for your perserverance on this.  When I click on the sleep tile, I get the vertical bar graphs showing hours slept over a week month or year depending on what is selected.  Below that is a choice of horizontal bars for last night and then each previous night.  When I select any night, I get a very nice horizontal line chart showing progression from light to deep to REM etc., over the course of the night.  Below that is the horizontal multicolored bar chart showing total time in each stage.  No benchmark is showing as is shown in the "help" section and no choice of time periods for that chart. So, I get the different colored sleep stage info for myself but no "hashmark" showing benchmark for my age and gender!!??HIM46
If you like the new restoration feature then you must be paying for the Premium Plan. 🙂
The wrist band has a pocket - you should wear your one so that it clips to the band with the body of the device being protected by the pocket.  Wearing the device on the outside of the wristband won't affect how the device tracks your sleep or step, just offers additional protection.
I would say the night shift pattern has a lot to do with your chronic depression and sleep patterns, it’s a lot for the body and the mind to work against regular patterns day/night. It’s like wanting to run diesel engine on petrol, same lack of daylight has a major effect on health, also sleeping when not dark will not give so much rest as during the night. Hope you can make it work! 🙂

From these two screen shots you can see there is a gap between 3:15 a.m. -4:35 a.m. But no steps are taken and I was in bed asleep.  What is the reason for the gaps in sleep record?  There are numurous requests for this gap in this discussion. Real answers are greatly appreciated. Thanks.
Hi Paul, I am not qualified to give you a solution to your problem I would suggest you see somone that specializes in sleeping disorders like RLS.  Conditions of this type can have symptoms that are extremely mild and might go undetected but sever enough to cause you to wake.  I wish I could be of more help.  Fitbit devices are sensitive to movement so for a score to be that low, would suggest to me that it's time for an expert.
@Rowmoseley thanks for chiming in with your experience. I'm glad your tracker was able to mimic what the CPAP machine was helping with. @Synapz are you still having an issue with this? 
 
@SunsetRunner Fitbit provides services to help you live a healthier life, but please keep in mind that our trackers and services are not intended to provide medical data. Please see your doctor if you're concerned with being diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Also, as the original post mentions, the "normal" setting is going to be the most accurate setting for almost everyone, and we strongly suggest most everyone use the normal setting.
 
@sharimah it's normal to still have restless lines in your sleep log, even if it's set to "normal." I'd be a little concerned if there weren't any (or a little jealous, because it means you sleep like a log and don't move at all during the night!) 
 
@NugsMom hmm, that sounds odd. Sleep is monitored by movement, so if you have a lot of animals in your bed, and you're moving a lot during the night, your tracker might actually think you're awake. That being said, can you please try a restart of your tracker? Let me know if this helps at all. 
 
@djbarker thanks for your question. Since your tracker determines "sleep" by how much movement you make during the night, if you're laying in bed in the morning being relatively still, your tracker may still 'think' you are asleep. If you're concerned about your awake time being inaccurate, you can go into your sleep log and edit your awake time. Hope this helps!

As I'm trying to figure out your pictures, I even searched for an app while doing it...This seems to be the fitbit's own custom activities page? Can you command the device to follow my real resting heart rate?I haven't thought of that...Yet, I figure that fitbit should include this as a simple task, not one that's found only by community members
I have been happy with my Blaze's sleep tracking.  But suddenly this morning my data is in pieces- everytime I was restless or awake for even a minute, it shows as a new sleep session in the app.  The sleep sensitivity is still set to normal- why is my data suddenly a mess? It is hard to read, and making it so that the sleep I got prior to midnight is applied to the previous day.  This is messing with my stats.
Duane I have had Sleep Apnea forever it seems like. I have owned numerous CPAP machines and RESMED finally came out with a machine that can be monitorred by WIFI. I receive a daily sleep report on a  by logging into their website.Mended Heart
It happens from time to time afterca sinc in the mornings, that the sleep stage info given is the old info and not the new with REM, light and deep sleep. Why is that?
Hello everyone! Newbie FitBit user here. I just bought mine last night and used it until bed. I put the little bugger in the wrist band and went to sleep. When I woke up this morning, it showed that I had burned about 300 more calories than I had before I went to sleep. I didn't notice where my steps had gone up (maybe ten tops which I considered being my rolling around), and wasn't sure if this is normal. I have it set to the 'normal' setting for sleeping statistics. Any help is apperciated!

Emerson | Community Moderator - English/EspañolI run all over SF. What's your story?
I’m only 24 but I’ve had narcolepsy symptoms since I was 12, and I can honestly say it can get harder as you get older. If you don’t use a cpap or bipap, I’d recommend it, since even mild OSA can really exacerbate narcolepsy symptoms. I have mild OSA too and I’ve noticed a pretty big difference since I started using my cpap a few months ago. I don’t know what it’s like to work long hours like nurses do, but I do work long-ish hours and they wipe me out. If you haven’t tried Nuvigil, you should. It’s been a miracle worker for me. As for kids, I don’t have any, so I can’t speak to that.Also, as an update to my last post (if anyone cares), I was re-diagnosed with ADHD a few months ago. So my studying issues really had nothing to do with narcolepsy. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school and put on Concerta, which is a stimulant, and which is probably why it took so long for me to be diagnosed with narcolepsy. But when I was finally diagnosed with narcolepsy, they took me off concerta and put me on provigil and later nuvigil, so my ADD symptoms were left untreated.Now I’m wondering if there’s some sort of connection between narcolepsy, adhd, and high-functioning autism (which I also have)? They all seem to go hand-in-hand. I know autism and narcolepsy are both linked to the neurotransmitter GABA. I’m sure there are connections to other mental illnesses too.
So it turns out that it needed about 24 hours to figure me out. The first time I looked it said I had 8 solid hours of sleep. Now it's showing the real amount, about 4.5 hours. So, you are probably right, that it goes by heart rate. Cool! I didn't want to fake figget just to let it know I was awake. The whole point is getting back to sleep. Note that I changed the setting to "sensitive". So it's also possible that that gave a more accurate reading too.
@TomW92 wrote:The sleep score system is entirely useless.. I'm assuming it's out of 100? I got 4 hours 53 minutes last night and get a score of 69, this is utterly ridiculous. 8 hours is what you're meant to get as an adult (please refer to why we sleep by Matthew Walker, a leading sleep expert). If it was a simple % based system I'd score 61 but considering less than 6 hours a night on a regular basis is considered detrimental to health I don't feel this is an accurate representation. Please bring back average time per week. I don’t see where the problem is. Does Fitbit claims sleeping for 5 hours is better than sleeping  for 8 hours? So you slept for 4 hours 53 minutes and got a score of 69. It’s deemed "fair" on the Fitbit scale, but it comes after "excellent" and "good". Chances are you would have had a much higher score if you had got the 8 hours of sleep prescribed by your sleep guru. I took my two extremes so far (I was switched to sleep scores 3 weeks ago). Here is my "best" night (90):  I got the 8 hours prescribed by your guru, which resulted in 47/50 for time asleep, as one would expect. I assume the 40 minutes spend awake is what prevented me from getting the maximum. Now here is my "worst" night (67):  Time asleep less than 6 hours, more than 1 hour awake. Much less deep sleep and REM sleep. Again, the much lower score is what one you would expect. Only "restoration" saved that night. Why is that, you may ask? Here is why:  My sleeping HR was below my daytime resting HR for 100% of the time. I personally disagree with you when you deem sleep score "entirely useless". And btw, weekly average of time asleep is still there to be seen, if you know where to look for it.

First I don't suffer sleep apnea.  I just finished a lengthy clinical sleep study that ruled that one out.  I however suffer insomnia.  I'm not sure how to read the graph on my device.  I have a flex 2 so it isn't as detailed as some other models.  I still need to know what they represent so I can report to doctors on the follow up after study.  Can someone please shed some light on this subject please?  Also to clarify, I did just start walking (only) for exercise 3 days ago.  Before then I was sedentary for years.  Thank you.

I'd love seeing sleep challenges too! 😍 Maybe a simple mission to aim to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night, as many nights as we can, for 30 nights in a row and that we don’t have to worry as it doesn’t need to be perfect, but just our best shot. I think it would be great! 🙃

I just purchased a new fitbit after my expensive versa died two months after the one year warranty because I am supposed to keep track of my sleep (any watch gives me steps).  Not only did the screen stop working for two days within the first month, but now this stupid sleep score and no way to choose to put it back?  Fitbit, I'm out.
I have had a Fitbit versa for a few years and it always tracked my sleep. Then all of a sudden it completely stopped tracking it. Occasionally maybe once a month it will track an hour or so of an 8 hour night of sleeping.  I figured it was just getting old and not working anymore, so I got myself a Sense for Christmas. Also doesn't track my sleep. Brand spanking new, I have done EVERYTHING recommended on every forum and reply from a "Fitbit expert." This is kind of pointless if all of the "nEw fEaTuReS" don't work because it doesn't work UNLESS your sleep is tracked.  I guess if I can'r figure this out I'll just send it back and continue to use my Versa since its basically the same thing.
sleep plays a crucial role in cleaning out the brain each night. While these toxins can be flushed out during waking hours, researchers have found that clearance during sleep is as much as two-fold faster than during waking hours.
You say you tell it when you are going to bed, and when you are awake.  Best not to do that.   Just let Fitbit figure out when you are sleeping on it's own.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

You are all right. I'm being very negative and I know that. I am just so frustrated with this whole situation. I contacted support several times and feel as if I have been just given the run around. And I had to submit my case a couple of times because it didn't seem they were actually paying attention to what I said. Like I was just given some boilerplate generic response based on skimming the message I sent.I had the Nike Fuelband and went out andbought the Fitbit specifically to track sleep. This is their competitive advantage and one of their main selling points.Unfortunately in life and especially as a customer service, sometimes you have to resort to negativity and shock to be listened to. It's not meant to be pretty. I tried being polite. I am also angry that this is something that has been happening to other users and no one is being helped. I felt that it was time that someone had to collect the facts and speak up.
Hi Heather and everyone, Great thread idea! I have been getting more interested in my sleep score recently. My score last night was 78 which is fairly average for me. I slept 7 hours 59 minutes which is much better than average but I only had 25 minutes of deep sleep. I had 1 hours 2 minutes of REM but don't remember any dreams. I had 6 hours 32 minutes of light sleep and that seems to be average for me. Better having light sleep than none at all - and crucially I was awake for 1 hour 28 minutes and I guess it is that element that reduces my overall sleep efficiency. The overall time in bed was 00:30 until 09:58. I am glad I don't have a dog to wake me up in the early hours but there is a speed hump outside and the noise of vehicles driving over it does often rouses me, especially when they carry loose material that rattles.
I have heard that the sleep on the Flex can be a little difficult to turn off and on. Have a look at the help forum for the Flex, you will probably find a stream related to this.
I have mild sleep apnea. This is mine without a cpap. Having 1 or 2 spikes that don't stay in the high for long, wouldn't be super concerning. Everyone has some sleep episodes. It's when there are many episodes, every night. If your worried ask your partner if they notice that you struggle to breathe during sleep or make gaging noises.
Hi there,Since it's time for moving forward, I'm looking for an alternative with accurate sleep tracking. I do not sleep well during the night.I read that Garmin is doing well in other aspects but not in sleep tracking. Any suggestion for an alternative with accurate sleep tracking?Thank you.

Yup - I have a schedule ... partly because we always put our dogs in their beds at 9pm and that's when we call it quits for the night.  The problem is that the medication I'm on causes insomnia
FOLLOW UP: I am in awe how our bodies adapt and respond to changes.  Due only to persistence and my sleep research, I offer this progress update to those interested in the science of healthy sleep habits.  My restoration sleep score continues to improve (21 to 23 out of 25) which in turn affects the overall sleep score with daily averages now in the 90 to 95 range.  I am committed more than ever to adapt everything I have gleaned so far into a lifetime of healthy habits towards restful sleep. Thank you Fitbit for participating and being a vital part of my overall healthy lifestyle. How were you able to lower your sleeping HR? I’ve lowered my RHR by 10 over the past month in a half but my sleeping HR is still well above my RHR for the first 1/2-1/3 of the night (sometimes more). I understand lowering your RHR will help but so far my sleeping HR hasn’t changed. I also get that it’s been a short amount of time since I started watching this and it takes time. I would think that lowering my RHR by so much already that it would have made some kind of difference. I’ve had 2 nights where my sleeping HR was higher for less than 1/2 the night. I analyzed those days and see nothing that was different on those days than any other. I must be missing something here.I have also done some research but I’ve not had much success in finding ways to lower both sleeping HR and REM sleep. I tend to get way more REM than average and less light sleep due to that, even though one of meds is supposed to suppress REM. I did skip that 2 nights and there was no change in REM sleep, I just had muscle spasms for several days after which made it harder to exercise those days. A side note: I do not drink, I have chronic pain so am limited on cardio workouts (I do walk and am able to spend some of the time walking faster in short bursts to bring it up, but never to peak), I’m 5’5” and 157lbs with a 26.2 BMI down from 28.6 (still dropping fat and gaining muscle). I’m sure the fat loss will help too. Unfortunately I do need medication to keep my pain in check. I have dropped by 50% in the past year, which helps other areas of my life, wish I could live on nothing but it’s not doable if I don’t want to be home bound. What kind of breathing exercises do you do that have helped you? I know they may not help me but I’d like to give it a shot. I do 3 mins of inhale 5, exhale 8 nightly before bed. It helps me fall asleep faster and I do feel better if I don’t forget to do them, which is very rare. Any advise or reading references would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for your post. It gives me hope that it’s possible to lower my SHR!
@Choreo It goes by movement. Probably when you are lying in bed and reading, you are moving about. When you turn off the light and lie down, you are much more still. Similarly, if you woke up, but didn't move - just closed your eyes and went back to sleep - the Fitbit will not know you woke up.

@PeterSD I am glad you found a solution for you in taking the watch off. I can honestly say I have never had an issue like the one you describe and I have worn five different trackers in the past three years. I guess it goes to the issue of light sensitivity which will hold true for clocks, phones, e readers- anything that is meant to be seen in the dark for you. thank you for bringing this to the community and raising awareness.

It's been some time, but I finally had my appointment with the sleep clinic. My results were quite surprising, and I mean that in a disappointed way. However, I have been using a CPAP machine for sometime since my appointment. I will say that my sleep is much better now with the machine. I. am grateful I went in when I did and my diagnosis put me on the right path and now, fingers crossed, this is one less reason the reaper can get to me. The use of the machine is not exactly perfected, but I certainly believe my chances of perhaps passing in my sleep have been lessened. I'm a disabled veteran and this is one of those things I can stress less about. Although, there is still a list of other abnormalities I deal with on a daily basis. I just wanted to say thank you to the support and advice I received from this community.  PeaceHotepAs Salam AlaykumShalomNamaste

After editing correct sleep start my Sleep Score DID NOT adjust accordingly.There is a secret function to reevaluate the score after editing? EDIT:OK, closing app and launch it again reevaluate Sleep Score.
It's great to have you here @Anne1946. I realize this response is a long time coming, but did want to take the time to address your post. I hope that by now everything is working properly, however, I wanted to ask you, were you experiencing this issue on your computer or a mobile device while you use the Fitbit app?  Thanks!   

Melissa | Community Moderator, FitbitHow are you fitbitting with your (pet) best friend? Show us!
The recommendation for time asleep and percentage they are saying like if you fell asleep at 10 and woke at 6 and don’t have any memory of being awake for a prolonged period of time that is an 8 hour sleep. They aren’t deducting micro awake times or 1 to 2 minutes a few times a night.Also if you take the total time slept and recalculate the percentage without the awake percentage: when they refer to needing 13 to 20 percent of deep sleep that’s of your total time asleep. So you would just take the deep or rem time in minutes divided by the total time asleep and the percentage is higher then FITBIT says because they include awake time and micro awake times.Also since FITBIT includes awake times of 30 seconds or so I just change my time asleep goal to 6 hours and 45 minutes which would be more then the minimal 7 hours recommendation if you have only 30 min of fit bit awake time.
My sleep efficiency is consistantly 96%.  However, I wake between 5 and 10 times each night.  I don't understand how the efficiency score is correct.
If it's happened just a couple of times, I wouldn't put too much credence in it. Could have been a momentary glitch. I get those sometimes, usually from the band shifting somehow during the night and then the signal re-connects. It doesn't seem that a couple of these would affect your resting heart rate much. But it is curious that your RHR jumped 14 bpm. If the starting RHR of 61 was when you first started using the tracker, then it's probably just that it's gathering data for the calculation and the most recent number is the most accurate. If you had a RHR of 61 for a while, and then it jumped, then there could be something behind that. Usually RHR goes down the more fit we become, and rises when stressed or overworked. There's lots of other factors that come into play with RHR, but I find it a good tool to monitor.

The article from the Fitbit blog is an average of all Fitbit users. The benchmark tab in the sleep section of the app is a little better, as it takes your age and gender into account. But like @Esya said, the most important piece of information is how you feel. I've had very intense workouts the day after getting only 30 minutes deep sleep. So it's not a precise indicator.

@Dominique holy wow!! I don't think I slept that well when I was a toddler. @Jnadeau sleep patterns change. you will find that some weeks you sleep like Dominique and others like your illustration (I sleep that way too). It depends on how you wind down not just your body, but your mind. I have no trouble falling asleep but every night at 2, I wake up. Some nights I fall back to sleep no problem and others I can tell you every creak and crack the house made till I get up at 6. The true test is how you feel the next day and day after and so on. If you are tired and cranky- you are not getting enough sleep and you should look into natural ways to boost sleep. If you are energetic and moving through the day no problem, then your body knew what it was doing and you are good to go.

I'm new to both Sleep Number bed & just got my Fitbit Versa 2.  I'm trying to figure out how to sync the apps.
I'm not sure if you solved your sleep data in pieces problem but I am adding my 2 cents here just in case, as I had this problem early on with my Charge HR. After some experimentation, including trying the other suggestions in this thread I determined that I was wearing the band just loose enough for the skin sensor to come away from my wrist if I rolled over on it wrong. Tightening the band one notch made it work but wasn't comfortable so I switched the Fitbit to my dominant wrist which was just enough larger to eliminate the blanks in the sleep data and still be comfortable. This had the added benefit of giving my non dominant wrist a break from wearing the band day and night.As for editing the sleep data per the suggestion above, I found that not much data is lost when creating a single record, it just removes the gaps. Admittedly, depending on how big the gaps are, the edited record may not be as accruate. Hope this helped.
@laurabar57 can you provide some more info? Do you get any sleep recorded? Was your sleep recorded as simple sleep? Has your sleep at least 3 hours in length? Did you use the manual start sleep now option?
If you go into the settings in the app, there's one that controls the heart rate monitor. If it's set to AUTO, try switching it to ON and see if that helps.

My pulse and Spo2 are 2 numbers less than my pulse oximeter. 68bpm would be 70 and my Spo2 would be 95 instead of 98.some times my pulse will match Spo2 not so much.
Hi @RichardMW - You say:  I do not see much deep + rem activity in my FitBit.I am starting to suspect that the fact that I am using a CPAP mask results in FitBit missing deep sleep & rem recognition. That has not been my experience with my CPAP and Versa 2. My reports have been a good mix of REM, Light and Deep sleep. You can read more about how Fitbit calculates sleep and sleep stages, and also read tips for a better sleep here.  You may also want to check how tight or loose your Versa 2 is on your wrist. The wristband should be snug but not constricting, a tight wristband restricts blood flow, potentially affecting the heart-rate signal ... which affects how sleep stages are interpreted.  Hope this helps.
Hi all.  I contacted Fitbit and my issue was caused by my device only having 15% charge left. It can't monitor your heart rate properly when it's as low as that apparently. Back to normal now after a full recharge.
I support the opinion of the commentator above. Problems with sleep should not be ignored since sleep greatly affects the state of mental and mental health. During sleep, short-term memory turns into long-term memory. Thus, all the day's experiences are processed, and in the morning, you are essentially "reborn". I also learned this and many other things related to sleep by contacting the counselling service. Before that, I, like you, did not assume that sleep is so important. I hope you solve this problem as soon as possible!
On a bad night, I can drop as low as 86% but usually I average about 91%. When my boyfriend is with me, I usually average a little better sleep around 95%. I think the tracker is fairly accurate for my sleep patterns.
I hope that you will find your answers, dear. Just please, do not give up. Everything has its solution :3I support you!
Or you could just be a restless / light sleeper like I am...

Having exactly the same problem. There's at least a few of us complaining about it. No official response yet.
It seems how much you are affected by wearing a Fitbit at night depends onyour personal sleep pattern. Obviously I my sleep is highly impacted.However, do love the Fitbit to track my exercise as it keeps me moving.Rebecca
As it is recommended that we get between 6-8 hrs sleep per night, the tracker is ideal for ensuring you know exactly how much sleep you are actually getting. By wearing the tracker, you will find out and subsequently be able to change your sleep pattern if necessary. Don't forget there are also many benefits about getting a good nights sleep. It is vital for your body to restore itself. Even if you are not so keen on wearing the tracker to bed, like I was, just try it and find out exactly what you are sleeping like. Now I have tried it, I wear it every night.

Hello everyone. @Rowanak Welcome to the community forums! 
 
I believe that one of the most important thing that you can do to increase your amount of "deep sleep" is to allow yourself adequate total sleep time. Often, individuals will deprive themselves of adequate total sleep. In addition to reducing deep sleep, REM sleep is also shortened.
 
There is some data to suggest that vigorous exercise can increase or consolidate deep sleep. Some sleep specialists recommend aerobic activities like jogging, running, and swimming. For those who are prone to insomnia, it is best to exercise earlier in the day and not before bedtime.
 
There are several steps you can take to increase your chances for getting a good night’s sleep. The National Sleep Foundation suggests sticking to a sleep schedule, avoiding naps in the afternoon, practicing a relaxing bedtime routine, and exercising daily among other recommendations. For more information on sleep stages, see our blog posts REM, Light, Deep: How Much of Each Stage of Sleep Are You Getting? and Your Heart Rate Is the Key to Smarter Sleep Stages. Here’s Why.
 
Hope this helps!

@emptyother I got a week with an average of 5.5! I know! And I was really tired. I'm more like a night person, so it's hard for me to go to sleep. I always find Twitter, or a blog, or a book. It's like a self auto induced insomnia. What I have found is that even if there is an average of sleep hours, it depends on each person. Try to stay above 6.5 and you'll be fine. You can set small goals every night.  I started to read @maddy 's excellent advice on How do you improve your sleep quality? And you should check what are you're eating before you go to sleep. You can find some lifestyle tips from the National Sleep Foundation and the Mayo Clinic. Happy stepping! 

Stephanie | Community AdvocateAll that stepping got you exhausted? Improve Your Zzzs!
You are in the healthly range. You really don't obtain a 100% efficiency. If you are higher then 90% Sleep efficiency, Thats well into the normal range. There are 4 stages of sleep. Stage 1, 2 3, 4 and rem sleep. You usally syat in stage 3 to 4 most of the night and with these stages there is some movements. Stage Rem sleep is where your body is totally relaxed and your brain takes over all fuctions. This occurs 3 to 4 hrs. before you wake up. This stage is used to monitor male erection. If a male does not have an erection during REM sleep then there is a neurologial problem. That is why most males wake up with an erection. Usually sleep apnea pt.s don't get pas stage 1 oor 2. In stage 1 thats when a relaxing agent is released from the body. Its like when you eat turkey and sit watching football, you kinda know whats going on but are real relaxed. Stage 2 is when you actually fall asleep and are unaware of your surroundings. This is when sleep apnea occurs, because the upper airwya muscles start to relax and obstruct the airway. SO there ya go. Sleep tight or sleep relaxed is the more  of a better term.
@Sammyken wrote:So, I was just wondering if anyone else has this issue. I find that with the Charge 2, and the heart-rate related auto-sleep, that I'm told I take 0 minutes to fall asleep. After I've been laying in bed for 40 minutes. I was just wondering if there was a way to still get the heart rate, detailed sleep report, but also be able to have it account for the fact that I'm wide awake for sometimes an hour before I fall asleep.Hi @Sammyken, Some people have reported this. It's because the fitbit is trying to determine the start of sleep by lack of movement.You can include the time awake before sleep as part of the sleep tracking. Just go into the sleep log the next day and select Edit, then you can change the start time to what you wanted it t to be. You can also tell it you are starting sleep via the app. Depending on how often you need to change the sleep record, this may or may not work better in your situation.

You might want to talk to your doctor about that. I use aromatherapy to help me sleep. I have this formula where I put one drop on my pillowcase, and I sleep fairly well. Lavender and vanilla are good relaxing scents. The blend I use is lavender, marjoram, cedarwood, and ylang ylang, and it's strong enough that a drop is good enough.
maybe try tracking in "normal" mode instead for a week and compare. How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?

My Fitbit Versa will show my sleep time in the morning after I get up, and then later in the day it will suddenly show additional sleep time when I was not sleeping. And it seems to be adding sleep time hours during the time frame of my morning workouts, which are obviously not accurate (spin, running, weights, etc). Why is this happening?
I've only had my Fitbit Charge 4 since last month.
 
Normally, when sleeping, my heartrate bottoms out at 40 or 41bpm, occasionally 39. The trend throughout the sleep is below 50, with gently forays above. Last night I had three interesting spikes, the first was 41-51-58-38-43 in consecutive five minute steps. Then there were five-minute steps of 47-37-37-43, shortly followed by 43-54-62-40. I don't really mind the quick increases, as movement will induce that, but normally my heartrate goes down very slowly (for example, after a long run it will be a few hours before it drops below 60).
 
It could be timing variations in my Fitbit. Is it normal for a drop of 20 (especially when going down to a record low)?
 
I've had an leg injury and so avoided even walking for a while now and I am planning on a file-miler tomorrow, as long as the calf muscle doesn't tense (it did in last Wednesday's walk). The lack of recent exercise means that I am surprised at the record low.
 
Moderator Edit: Clarified subject
how we will know if it is being rollout in my region(INDIA) or if not whenit will be rolled out ?I say lack of communication or bad communication.
Your symptoms are very narcoleptic in that they could be out of my sleep journal. I can show you what Narcolepsy looks like on the Fitbit sleep thing. It incorrectly thinks my best sleep is Deep Sleep and frequently cannot even tell I am asleep due to restlessness. The definitive question for Narcolepsy is, if you take a 15 minute nap, do you dream? Normal sleepers do not. Narcoleptics do because their REM is so dominant. Other tells are: falling down laughing, falling down angry, sleep walking, hallucinating right before falling asleep or immediately on waking, as REM crosses into wakefulness. Narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder, not a behavioral issue as has previously been suspected. To be honest, it's the biggest reason I got a Fitbit, to help log my sleep and understand my sleep disorder.
I sleep 7 hours at night and 1 hour at siesta time. 1) How come the website does not include the siesta hour with overall sleep hours?2) Sleep efficiency is important. So if I slept 7 hours at 70% efficiency then I really slept 5 hours. Am I right? Thanks.
Follow some simple tips like avoiding caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and alcohol close in bedtime. Make sure your sleeping environment is quiet and dark throughout the night. Practice a simple breathing exercise.
I used to face this either. I've been using fitbit one for sleep tracking but there was wrong data. Amazon fitbit one specifications http://amazon.manymanuals.com/sport-watches/fitbit-one/specifications-13561 helped me to understand how to set settings correctly without getting additional problem in futher usage.
Hey everyone, I need some help. I used to have the fitbit HR watch and loved it for the sleep information, but it died from water. I upgraded to the fitbit charger 4 because it is waterproof and can track my sleep. Ever since I got it though, it hasn't recorded my sleep on my watch and doesn't seem to even have to option in the app on my iphone. Do I have to pay $10 a month to see what used to be free on my HR watch? This is the main reason I bought the watch.  Does anyone know how to get the option to show up in the app.? I'm confused and google searches aren't helping so far. Zo

I don't snore and breath fine. (though every now and then when i am in deep sleep I breath very shalow). I have tried air mattresses, tempurepedic mattresses latex mattresses, and a long list of others. I do know I am VERY stiff when I wake up. I was supposed to get a sleep study done but the woman who ran the studies said I didn't need it because SHE felt that it was due to stressors in my life so sent me back to the therapist. (who was annoyed)
I have a charge HR and when I try to change the sleep sensitivity settings I do not find that as an option on the navigation choices.  Is this a software glitch with Fitbit?@jgilles wrote:Seems to work for me now.
What I am about to share with you works for me. My disclaimer is that you please clear any physical exertion beyond your normal levels with a qualified professional. Before I start, allow me to share this thought I discovered years ago which made an impression on me at the time and still speaks volumes today, “A person who resolves to begin regular morning exercises usually does so not because he already has physical fitness but in order to get something he does not have. Once one has something he can be anxious to keep it; previous to that, he is anxious to get it.”My passion for fitness exceeds 40 years.  I taught aerobics back in the day of leg warmers until running became the “in” thing to talk about and do. So naturally I had to become a runner. Fast forward to today, I am now retired and I try to maintain a sensible routine that includes the four components of fitness: cardio, strength training, flexibility, and nutrition. About 20 years ago I stumbled on Phil Campbell’s Sprint 8 for my cardio, just 20 minutes a day. (Here’s a link to describe the theory: https://sprint8.com/the-workout/). An interval type workout is extremely beneficial for strengthening the heart muscle which in turn lowers the RHR. The Sprint 8 can be adjusted to your current level of fitness and gradually increased over time.Strength training (not bodybuilding or weightlifting) keeps my major muscle groups in check. I do no more than ten repetitions each using handheld weights for the major skeletal muscle groups forming the upper body which are the abdominal, pectoral, deltoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, biceps, and triceps. The major skeletal muscle groups of the lower body are the quadriceps, hamstrings, gastrocnemius, soleus, and gluteus. I always work both sides of a muscle group so as not to cause injury in tearing a muscle due to a lack of resilience in an underworked muscle.Flexibility is important to keep the tendons and ligaments structurally aligned to support the entire skeletal system. Flexibility is the range of motion in a joint or group of joints or the ability to move joints effectively through a complete range of motion. Flexibility training includes stretching exercises to lengthen the muscles. Nutrition is the fitness glue and is more than a fad diet with a scale. I chose to go vegan three years ago and I limit my intake of salt, no refined sugar, and no processed foods. When my sodium intake is high, I notice a correlating increase in my RHR for that day. To keep the critical food naysayers at bay I simply tell them my food choices are the result of a heart condition.  The heart condition doesn’t have to be a bad thing [wink and a smile].OK, let me summarize and I apologize for rambling but our RHR is the result of all of the above. The whole idea is to train your heart to work smarter not harder. Throw in deep breathing exercises to train your diaphragm and lungs to disperse the ever important oxygen to your blood cells and major organs and you are on the right path to a healthier lifestyle. I breath deep (nose breathing not mouth breathing) whenever I am not talking; deep nose breathing is an acquired habit. Most people tend to be shallow mouth breathers and bypasses the all important function of the nose which filters out contaminants and warms the air before it enters the lungs. Last but not least, I try to maintain a daily 10,000+ step regimen.  Oh and the best part of staying healthy is achieving good mental health, reduced stress, and low blood pressure sans prescription meds. Thank you for asking the question and thank you for reading this post. May all your steps be heart healthy...

I've been tracking my sleep for about 6 months with my charge 3.  I only get a sleep score/sleep details/sleep stages about 50% of the time.  I have not been able to find a pattern as to when I do or don't get a sleep score. When I don't get a sleep score, the sleep quality that is displayed doesn't match anything in the graph.  For example, last night my sleep quality "mins awake / restless" is 4, but the graph heading shows a restless value of 3 and an awake value of 31.  The graph itself breaks down into 14 minutes awake and 18 minutes restless.  The "awake" graph heading normally matches the combined restless and awake values in the graph, while the "restless" graph heading seems to match the awake values in the graph, not the restless values. Why doesn't the "mins awake / restless" in the sleep score match what is shown on the graph (either the headings or the graph detail)?  Why do the graph headings differ from the graph detail?
yep, makes sense to me!  Hope you get better fast........I hear even the mildest of covid infections are nothing to sneeze about.........so take care of yourself!
@pwung0327 you are right. Sleep score probably means nothing. Why? Because it cannot be verified as it is a "proprietary" metric (how convenient...). If something cannot be verified then it could be just random number given and it would mean exactly the same. Sleep score is just another made-up metric not backed by any science. Your second question is very interesting and there is a lot of research done discussing such correlation (it is really interesting topic). As for HRV, it requires having accurate sensor. Wrist-based optical HR sensors (any, not just Fitbit) very unlikely are able to provide accuracy.
I know you dont want advice, but if you like the tracker but dont like the sleep stages either don't look at them, or as you suggest, turn off the HR monitor and revert to the old sleep cycles. I actually like them, but Im not getting hung up on each percentage or the number of hours etc. If I feel good and as if I had a good nights sleep that is more important to me than getting the numbers all looking perfect. Hope you work out something that fits for you.

I found this, in the watch go to settings then quiet mode, scroll down to schedule, tap; it'll open a window where it mentions non-scheduled sleep. There is an off-on option with hours to be set; from there I don't know what or how it does whatever. Worth exploring.
I got an idea about this last night. In that hour before bed, where I'm still awake but not moving much, take the tracker off and set by the bedside. Then when I get into bed for sleep, put the tracker back on. Going to try this tonight and see if it works.

Hello - I have a similar issue, not showing sleep score even though I am sleeping over 7hrs. J have updated the software, logged on and off and am not selecting "begin now" in app. I still get no score.
I was trying to track and see if that was the case.  I had a pretty in depth spreadsheet with 15 point variablesd I kept for awhile, but after some time realized I was sweating over the details too much.  I recommitted to CPAP some time ago and use nightly now.  I do notice a better overall version of myself from it.  Sure I still look at my Fitbit sleep data each morning, as well as my ResMed app, but I don't fret over minor swings and too many of the details anymore.  As long as I am u sing my CPAP and hit my goal of 6 1/2 hours of sleep most nights, I'm good to go.  Best wishes.
how do you get to that option on the app
@KryptonianCtzn, how often do you take your mask off?  Maybe because my sleep apnea is so over the top bad, but I cannot imagine trying to sleep without my mask on.
@HEDDWEN   Sleep stages are an EEG diagnosis.  Your Fitbit uses heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing rate, and lack of wrist movement to estimate sleep stages.  You can't draw any conclusions from Fitbit sleep stages.

Laurie | Maryland, USAVersa 3, Luxe, Aria 2 | iOS | Mac OS Take a look at the Fitbit help site for further assistance and information.
Last night to experiment I prepped for bed, turned off all the lights, and quietly read starting at 9:50.   At 10:00 p.m. sharp I went to bed, and fell asleep normally in :05 or :10 minutes.   My FitBit Inspire 2 shows:  11:16 p.m. - 5:44 a.m. The end time 5:44 a.m. is spot on perfect.  The start time 11:16 is well over an hour late.  It should be approximately 10:05 Over the last two weeks I've been trying to consistently go to bed shortly after 10:00, My FitBit Inspire 2 show start times all over the map. Half are in the correct zone (10:00 - 10:30)  the other half are over an hour or two late.   12:30 a.m.?  11:16 p.m.? What can I do, what behavior, syncing, HR, temperature, to help the Inspire 2 more often correctly find my start time....It works sometimes (about 50%)
Sleep stages depend on tracking your heart rate so it won't be coming to the fitbit One.

Hi CleliaCI'm afraid I can't answer that question. I'm not very bright when it comesto tech issues and anyway, I've never used the manual facility before.I had problems with the sleep function some months ago. After tryingeverything they suggested it still didn't work and so they kindly sent me anew tracker. It was all very quick, they were massively helpful, and I can'tfault how their support team managed the whole thing. So I'd suggest gettingin touch with them for advice. They are taking quite a while to answermessages but that's all down to the pandemic. Rest assured they will replyas soon as they can.I'm now having new problems with the tracker which is why I contacted them acouple of weeks ago but it wasn't just down to the sleep issue.If you do make contact with them then good luck!StuartSent from Stuart's PC
I’m a 75-year-old man, and I’m going to post two graphs. The first one is what I see most every morning when I look at my oxygen variation graph,  The second is a graph from this morning.  This is actually the highest spike I’ve ever had.  About twice a month I’ll see one spike that usually barely goes into the “orange zone.”  I’m interested in the analysis others might have of this. Since these spikes are the exception and not the rule, and when they occur they are one lone spike and not multiple spikes throughout the night, I tend to think they are not an indication of sleep apnea but are more likely due to my twisting my wrist during sleep in a way that pulls the Fitbit away from my wrist momentarily.  What do others think.
I sympathize with you as I went 9 months with 1-3 hours of sleep. I went to the doctor and had to take sleeping pills so I could get some sleep. Sleep is essential so you need to get the issue resolved. I was determined to go off the sleep editing so here are some things I do that help me- regular exercise. Very important- unwind at night with reading- when I wake up at night I listen to talk radio with ear buds and it usually gets me back to sleep-for those occasions when I this does not work and I am sleep deprived for days, I take a sleeping pill
If you want your details, like restoration, oxygen levels, temperatures, and snore report, you will have to do what I did and take screenshots from the phone app, because apparently none of that is available on the desktop app. Once you get the screenshots, you can mail them to yourself and print them out or by the time you do all that, you could just show your phone to your doctor). 😁
I’m sorry the trouble shooting did not work for you, @RichardMW . You are very methodical. A question - Does your heart rate appear to be working correctly? Try carefully cleaning the contact points. Instructions are here.  If you have not already done so, you may want to check out the Fitbit Help documentation regarding the estimated oxygen levels and the Help data regarding sleep stages-  how they are calculated, and how to interpret your results.  Finally, it never hurts to restart your Versa a couple times. Wish I could suggest more. Maybe other CPAP users will chime in with their experiences.

You can manually edit them together, though not sure about effect on sleep stages.  I often do this, but I don't usually get sleep stages anyway.  Note the beginning time of first sleep section, then delete it; then open 2nd sleep section, edit it to change beginning time to when 1st section began and save it; then it will show as one whole sleep with awake break when you got up; at least does that for me.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
One thing I would ask is do you have any particular habits before bed? Make a list of anything that comes to mind and perhaps you can pinpoint something that is potentially stimulating your body and not relaxing. Some suggestions will not work for everyone. I for one love to drink chamomile tea at bedtime. That may keep someone else up going to the bathroom. Try 1-2 things a night to see if they help in relaxing you. Keep mixing and matching until you find the right combination for yourself. Of course the suggestion of avoiding caffeine is always a good one. Sleep is important and  we all must make an intentional effort to get it. You can do it! Don't give up if you have a rough night!
A few years back, I stumbled across an article that described how in the past (before electric lighting), it was quite normal to be awake for a couple of hours in the middle of the night, using the time for activities such as checking on animals, visiting neighbours, and getting frisky. Reading it, I realized that it was describing what would be an ideal situation for me.
I don’t think you missed anything in set up @SunsetRunner   SPO2% doesn’t show up on the website.  It shows up on the app on the Home Screen under, not sleep, but “health metrics.”
I found that my Flex really resisted going in and out of sleep mode. I don't have a smartphone so the app is not an option. The tapping on the Flex was driving me crazy. Never seemed to work well. This is why I am now a Force owner. I love the Force much better than the Flex.

Hi @BriAnne5, I had that happen to me during the sleep update. It fixed itself after a couple of times of using the old way of tracking. I don't think there's anything you can or have to do on your end. One thing to note is that naps and sleep less than 3 hours are still tracked in the old method, probably because there's no REM during such a short sleep.

How to calculate efficiency from data provided by dashboard?( Sleep duration, fall asleep, times of restless, times of awake and time(min) awake/restless. )...Dashboard shows "times of awake", howHow can I know Time(minutes) of "times of awake"?
😀🎉 ... this is something we need to celebrate @Bartfliet! I'm glad to know that you could sleep better at least for one night, this is a step to the right direction.
 
Waking up at 3 am and having issues to sleep again is very common for a lot of people, this is something that mentioned @alexthecat too. But I think that what really helps is how you feel when you're going to sleep, meditation is nothing else that taking a time to let your body to relax and feel happy and thankful for the day. I bet you were reading something that you like last night, 40 minutes it's a lot. Watching TV or having screen time in other device is not recommended before going to sleep 🙈 it can delay the release of melatonin so it pushes back bedtime and leads to less restful sleep 🙃.
 
If you enjoyed the other article, take a moment to read this one. It's really good. 😊👍 Just try not to read it in bed. 😅

@Azura18, I don't see your graph, can you repost?
There are several things I've noticed over the years that disrupt my sleep.Temperature -- too cold or too warm.  I've found a sweet spot with my thermometer at night that keeps me at a really nice temperature for optimal sleep.Too much food before bed.  If I eat too close to bedtime, it causes me to have dreams and be uncomfortable -- lots of tossing and turning!Light and noise.  I'm a light sleeper.  While I enjoy falling asleep to the TV, I do turn it off when I'm on the brink of falling asleep so as it won't disturb me during the night.

Thanks Davey, That was the case. I checked again and it was set to 12:44 pm rather than am.
I have wondered the same thing.  I have the Charge but not the HR.  I am not sure how it knows if I am sitting or "sleeping". It did however log sleep time while I was at the movies.  Funny, this was one movie that I didnt sleep through.
No. But I picked up that it takes about an hour to start sleep monitoring. And I've seen a couple times that when syncing is laggy, then I get the old pattern. Regardless of amount of charge. It goes back eventuallySent from my iPhoneSent from my iPhone
Hello Fitbitters! I was wondering how long was the maximum Fitbit users have slept. In my case is 12 hours. That day I was so tired that I didn't know about myself until I realized I had spent half day in bed. I found koalas and sloths are the most somnolent animals, they sleep for about 16 to 18 hours a day. That is what I call a good life. 
 

 
In the opposite, dolphins and sharks rarely sleep. They seem to just slow down their energies for short periods during the day.

Well had a nana nap this afternoon and decided to turn the sleep mode on and it worked, hmm I get the feeling its all in the touch if it turns on or not. Have been little bit stronger with the taps right near the top where the lights show....Thank you for your input...
Hi. Alcohol might make you feel like you sleep better, but it doesn't make your sleep more regenerating than without alcohol. Cheers.
His @Lizzy500 and welcome to the forums. Can you please tell us which Fitbit device you have and which phone you are syncing to? That will enable us to help you.
Why does fitbit not provide this data? It would be very helpful for me. Would fitbit consider providing this data in the export?
Sleep score last night: 83.  I fell asleep before 9pm and was awake around 5am, though I stayed in bed reading on my Kindle until the dog got me up at 5:45.  I think I slept pretty well.

No need to be sorry, I'm just having trouble interpreting these numbers. I'm surprised FitBit doesn't offer a glossary of key terms of some sort.  This is my weekly summary. It would be good to have something to compare to in order to know what needs to improve. What is the target sleep efficiency? How many times per night to people who sleep healthy are awakened?What spacing do pink bars have on a healthy sleeper's graph?Without these parameters, we have to be sleep specialists to correctly interpret this data. Fitbit, where are you?
I have the same issue but it's not even asking for a subscription. I used the "log sleep" feature in the app. It used to give me details but now it doesn't. How do you know whether heart rate data are being collected?
I am looking for this information also.  Please help!
@pwung0327, the situation is that your Fitbit device automatically detects your movements. For this reason, when you wake up or get up at night, your Fitbit device will finish the Sleep tracking and it will start recording a second log after it detects that there hasn't been any movement. This is expected. 
 
I'll be around.

Hi, my Fitbit HR is recording multiple 'waking' incidence each night, sometimes over 30 or 40. I am not conscious of having woken at all - but could this high number really be within normal limits? If not, what are the possibilities other than sleep apnea? I have asked for a referral to a sleep clinic for further investigation but just wondered if other members were getting these kind of readings without there being any health problem? I don't feel particularly sleep deprived, though I do tire some days, and I am 62, female, and carrying too much weight (which is proving very difficult to shift).
The crazy part of the “Sleep Score” and removal of easy access to your hours and minutes averages, it’s still being tracked on your app and you can clumsily reach the info. Why the info is still there but easy access to the info has been removed. From the main app screen down on the right touch community then near the top touch the line that says what are you up to then touch the sleep icon. BOOM there it is like before. I’m on the latest iOS and my Fitbit app was recently updated
Hi @ReneSorensen - Even though Fitbit removed that option from its app, it’s easy to set the alarm on your charge 3. Instructions can be found here.
There should be an option in fitbit like (please wake me when I have completed  8 hours  of sleep or more or less) and it should wake you with an alarm in tracker when you have completed 8 hours of sleep
The stats show I get less than 3 hrs sleep even though I was in bed 5-6 hrs. This happens a lot & snly sometime am I aware that I'm awake. I have volunteered to direct our Children't Church & need all the energy I can get. Has anyone experienced this?
my fitbit does not let me know how many times i am restless through the night,, it use to,,, but doesnt any longer
I'm in the 10-20 range in normal and only slightly more in sensitive.  Definitely feel tired all the time though, but I've felt like that for a decade so this is only showing me that perhaps I'm not crazy 🙂
I slept longer last night than I did the night before, yet apparently I didn't sleep long enough to get a sleep score. Weirdly, I did get a sleep score the night before?
Hey,New to the community part of Fitbit, however made use of Fitbit for quite a while currently ...- I was lately (Mar 21) diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia throughout a sleep study.- I was recommended Waklert  for daytime sleepiness and also concentration problems a couple weeks prior to the study.- Within the last two months, it has actually concerned my interest that i have problems with mild hypothyroidism.
My major inquiry is:
I get on Waklert for my tiredness and also ADHD, and I essentially can not operate without a 4:1 sleep-to-wake proportion or Adderall. Nonetheless, Waklert eliminates all my appetite as well as my physician specifically told me to quit vaping to induce cravings and also recommended discouraging off the .
For those of you who have hypersomnia, exists various other medications or techniques you have utilized to be able to operate daily?
Thanks,johnlsummey04
 
Moderator Edit: Formatting
Yes, that makes sense. Particularly as I also notice my "light sleep" time is always rather a lot more than the benchmark for my age while my "awake time" is rather a lot less. So I suspect FitBit is interpreting my wake times as light sleep in a lot of cases. And when I wake up I tend to just lie still and not toss and turn as is I suppose more usual, thereby not altering my HR enough to the extent that it tells my device that I'm awake.  Hard to know what to do other than just read the stats a bit differently I suppose.
I showed my neurologist the stats for sleep as I purchased the premium package as sleep for a narcoleptic is crucial. The sensitive setting I used seems to fall in line with sleep testings I've had done.
I think this is good advice for everyone — unless you’re battling a serious sleep disorder. Then it might be wise to seek medical help.But for the occasional night when you just can’t get to sleep or stay in that sweet REM phase, don’t worry so much. You’ll get through it.The next morning, give yourself permission to go a little slower, if at all possible.For example, if I stared at the ceiling all night, I don’t push myself to make major business decisions. I pay bills, read relevant articles, and do less brain-intensive tasks. I remember that tonight will likely be better.
Hi John again appreciate your taking the timet help.  The idea of having to walk around for several minutes in order for Fitbit to then decide I am no longer asleep before I get into the shower is just not good enough. There is a simple way around this and that is for Fitbit to display an option (just like ever acivity setting, such as workout, weights, walking, run etc) that allows you to pause or finish that activity.  Then it is an activity the user can stop on the Fitbit band and not having to use another device like your PC or your smart phone to "trick" the Fitbit in order for it to record the correct end of the sleep period.
Sleep sensitivity has effect only on Fitbit without HR sensor such as the original Inspire, the Alta (non HR version) and the Ace series.

Cool, I didn't realize that. Is there a model that is better for sleep tracking/analysis? As a competitive triathlete, I'm only interested in sleep and recovery metrics, such as resting heart rate. Steps are less important.  Thanks.
Following...
It sounds good but didn't work for me, the putting it in sleep mode. I found myself tapping the fitbit repeatedly until it switches ...
A friend who has the flex told me theres a way online that you can tell it to enter the sleep mode by itself. I have ADD and often forget to enter the mode and if I do I forget to get out of it. I also forget that you can mannualy enter it. Am I missing something, or is this just not available. I want to keep tracking my sleep because I want to try and make it better.
So, if you lay down, fall asleep, and then wake up 45 minutes later, it does not see that as "sleep"?
Just got my fitbit yesterday and tracked my sleep. My problem is that in the menu it says I was awake 51 minutes, but if I combine the times feom the spikes on the graph it's more like 25 minutes. The graph feels more accurate to how I slept last night. Is there a reason they dont show the same?
I had a fitbit flex, works great until I lost it.  I found my old fitbit zip, but the sleep is missing from the dashboard now.  How can I bring it back?
Hi @CHRiSGREEN77, Currently, that can't be done, and I don't expect Fitbit would start doing that. Or else people could manipulate the numbers any way they want to get any kind of sleep score. But feel free to make a post in the Feature Suggestion section of the site, so they can see the idea and other people can vote on it also. If enough people vote for it, Fitbit may implement it.You can edit the sleep start and stop times, but not the sleep score directly. I've also had the problem with the device mistakenly treating nighttime TV as sleep. The workaround that helped is I take the tracker/watch off while doing this kind of thing, and then put it on right before bed. It's a good time to give the device a charge, and then when I put it on and go to bed, the sleep tracking is accurate. Hope this helps.

Don't underestimate the value of sleep. Your body needs that just as much.
I'm doing the premium trial and thought I would play the guided sleep meditations before bed. Am I missing a setting here, but this only runs when the screen is on for me. Surely I'm expected to sleep during this meditation. Why would the screen need to be on to play the audio?
Hey @aaicha8 , that's some of the symptoms of sleep apnea. Also, headaches, waking up to urinate multiple times during the night are some others. Your Dr. can set you up with a sleep test either a home test or at a sleep lab. I was super tired and had headaches when I woke up. Got tested and had severe sleep apnea. It's really worth finding out. Take care. Feel much better now.
Hi @RonRM I've had this happen a couple of times too, sometime because my heart rate is a bit higher than my normal resting. No matter what the reason is, you can edit your sleep time and the score will adjust. On your mobile device go to the Today screen, view the details of your sleep score for the day you want to edit/correct, in the upper right corner of the screen you will see ... select it and you should see a menu:Edit LogDelete Sleep Log Edit to change your time asleep. Hope that helps.

Yes maybe you're right.Mine's a Charge HR and now I've looked online it mentions nothing about sleep mode.Mine cleverly worked out when I was cycling though, so that was impressive. I wonder if they need a bit more time to learn? I may try switching mine back to normal as that's what's recommended but I've not had 9.5 hours' sleep since I was in nappies so if it tells me that again then it's pretty useless.
Possibly if you moved little you might need to adjust setting to being more sensitive. Also I have had when the wrist strap for my One gets loose that it no longer tracks accuratly.
I tried sensitive last night. It didn't start any sooner and I got thickred lines.

Well, if you sleep like a baby for 7+ hours every night, I guess you don't need to be concerned about tracking your sleep. Does this describe you?

@AllThatGlitters, that makes sense to me. We know that excessive mental stimulation can make getting to sleep more difficult. And that deep sleep tends to occur early in the sleep cycle.  As we all know, at the end of a day of vigorous activity, our bodies just fall into sleep. The mental component winds down, and our deep sleep is allowed to happen naturally. At least that's how I see it. Tried an experiment with a sustained nap yesterday afternoon. 4 hour nap, 1 hour deep sleep, very little REM activity. Felt very refreshed.

I doubt if there is a "normal" sleep pattern. The book "Sleep for Success" by Dr. James Maas might give you some direction there. I've been recording my sleep using the fitbit one for about two weeks and I'm surprised at how "regular" it is. It seems to be recording very much the way I THOUGHT I was sleeping. After we've put our books down, turn off the lights, do our "goodnight" routine, that's when I start my fitbit. And I actually do drop off to sleep "quickly"  -- within a few minutes-- 3-10. Then unless my husband gets up for something and we talk, I might turn over, but then nothing till morning.  This morning, for instance, when we got up, he said, those darn dogs next door woke me up at 6:00 and I couldn't get back to sleep." But I said, "I didn't hear them." But when I looked at my sleep log, I saw that I actually DID! Just momentarily, but I saw a "disturbance" in my sleep at that time." I thought that was amazing! I love it!
Sleep Cycle: Best sleep-tracker app and Misfit Ray is The best sleep tracker under £50.
I had a Flex and found it very inconsistent at accepting the sleep on-off tapping.  Some days it worked & some not.  Since I was already using SleepCycle app on my iPhone, I manually entered the sleep time from that app.  Got a graph that didn't look much like the sleep cycle graph. Now I have a Force (wanted the readout, not because of problems).  I find the sleep setting on the Force easier to use, and more consistentat working than on my Flex. Personally i think the company has some QC issues.  The technology isn't as well developed as it will be in a year or two.  My overall feeling is that the current product is so far superior to pedometers and other simple tools that  it's worth the price and the glitches. My biggest complaint is the dumb clasp arrangement. If it matters to anyone, I'm 71 years old  - and managing to learn this technology w/o much trouble.
I would like to know also!!  Significant difference in sleep tracked with these two functions.

It's "insurance normal" to have an AHI (Apnea-Hypopnea-Index, or number of apneas (breathing pause) and hypopneas (breathing much slower but no pause) per hour of sleep) of 5 or less per hour.  It's an "insurance normal" because AHI of greater than 5 on a sleep study is required for Medicare to cover treatment and essentially all other public & private US insurance use the same standard. Probably 3 or less is ideal for treatment and many people would be lower than this. The Fitbit breathing chart wouldn't tell you directly anything about your AHI because even with sleep apnea your blood O2 won't start dropping significantly unless or until your apnea is severe.  Fitbit doesn't precisely determine blood O2, just level of variation and an overall estimate of % for the entire night. With the old graph, I never had any variations outside of low. With the new graph, every night I have lots of yellow spikes even though I wear a CPAP to bed each night.

I have the same exact issue. My work schedule changes in which sometimes I have to work a night shift. Whenever I do so, I sleep during the day and my charge 3 never picks up any of my daytime sleep. Even when I know I’ve slept good for 7 hours during the day, nothing is recorded on my charge 3. I’ve tried both normal and sensitive sleep settings and settled on normal. I have my activity period for bedtime set for 11 pm and wake up set for 7 am because that is more of my normal schedule. Could this possibly make a difference? It would be inconvenient to have to switch back and forth for my activity period for bedtime and wake up time each time I have to work a night shift. Even so, I have tried that to see if it makes any difference and it didn’t as no daytime sleep was picked up. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance
@DrakkhenThanks for stopping by the community! You should make your pros and cons of what you would like to track while sleeping. For example, sometimes I wake up around 12 a.m. and read. I don't turn the sleep mode off, because it will count all movements as being awake. I like to see this sleep behavior reflected on my graph.  When your tracker indicates that you are moving so much that restful sleep would not be possible, your sleep graph will indicate that you were "awake." You can read more about sleep recording here: sleep tracking FAQs. Hope it helps!  

Stephanie | Community AdvocateAll that stepping got you exhausted? Improve Your Zzzs!
Just to update: I put the fitbit on "sensitive" mode last night. Still 0 min to sleep..but now only a 67% sleep efficiency. It says I was awake/restless most of the night. With such varying differences between normal & sensitive how do I know which is more accurate?
@Bobgillan, thank you for your reply! 
 
For example, if you go to sleep on Saturday evening and you wake up at Saturday before midnight, then it gets logged as Saturday. However; if it is after midnight then it is logged as Sunday. At this time, your patience is appreciated but this is the way the Sleep tracking works and we currently don't have any option to modify this. 
 
Hope this helps! 

	Wilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.
My guess (no guarantee I am right on this) is that they are all nearly the same accuracy, and most of the intelligence of it is in Fitbit's processing of the heart rate data that Fitbit gets back from the tracker.  However I suppose there are slight improvements in the hardware collection of the heart rate data that could improve sleep tracking slightly with newer models. However, I haven't compared and don't have any real basis for that, other than how I expect things work.

Please clarify the criteria used for determining the sleep score.  It does not seem to corelate to either the time spent asleep or how rested I am the next day.  To really be a valid score, it should actually corelate to both of these items.  To me it is just a meaningless, random number.
Admittedly I'm not really familiar with the scope of moderators' jobs. However, assuming they are Fitbit staff, who are employed to provide support on the forums, I am surprised that they are not more tooled up on the latest knowledge. This may be more the fault of Fitbit rather than the individuals but then I would be even more surprised that they do not provide more information to their staff, especially regarding updates and features. For example, you would not expect a new version of Andriod or IOS to be released, and find many simple questions unable to be answered, even by staff. There should be full patch notes for firmware and app updates, and also relevant training to staff. With regards to the original query though, I agree that they are probably very tiny periods of restlessness. What I would be interested to know is, if these fragments are totalled up and then classified as 'awake' and then deducted off their corresponding stages.
Did you see one for the One, because I don't. Thanks!
@SunsetRunner Actually that isn't a bad idea, it would make sense when trying to compare things etc.

Hi.. I've had my flex for over a week and so far, love it. However, I wasn't sure of how often to charge it and it lost charge during sleep last night. 😕 Mine does track restlessness and time awake, however after losing charge it didn't track that part, but the still the hours in bed. Strange. Lesson learned though, stay on top of it charging. 😉
Those aren't going to block blue light, unless the tint is totally different to how it is in the picture. They should be bright orange, not a pale yellow like that. The ones the OP linked to look like the right colour. Not necessarily comfortable over prescription specs, but the right colour.
Thanks for jumping in guys! I don't drink to much since I'm kind allergic to anything with alcohol. Lol.  What I do know is that at all dosages, alcohol causes sleep disruptions in the second half of your night's sleep. REM sleep stage is significantly delayed.

No worries. Sleep stages from Fitbit were often associated with the release of the Alta HR, which I think caused some to mistakenly believe the Alta HR had more updated technology. Basically, whichever tracker you can wear comfortably so that heart rate monitoring is continuous without dropouts, is going to give you the best results.

I came across this message when googling deep sleep. I lack deep sleep, but get too much REM sleep consistently. That is characteristic of narcolepsy. I first began experiencing symptoms as a teenager but wasn't diagnosed until my mid thirties after a sleep study. I like the Fitbit for exercising, but mostly got it to help improve my sleep. I try to maintain a consistent bedtime and wake-up time as recommended by my neurologist. On days I run I average 20 minutes more sleep. However, I have yet to find the trick to increasing the amount of time in deep sleep. I can get plenty of sleep, but that deep sleep is what makes me feel rested. After a night REM all night long, I wake up quite groggy. Good luck!
Hi, @MellowYellow, welcome to the forums! Yes, it is definitely better to get up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Your body likes the same routine every day. That's why people who work different shifts have a really hard time with sleeping. I try to sleep in on weekends, but my body will wake me up at 5 am anyway, so I might as well get up. The trick is to go to bed early enough that you won't want to sleep in on weekends.
There's a thread here with tips on getting more deep sleep. In general, deep sleep declines as people get older, although this is associated with aging.

I am having the same results. I sleep better when not wearing the Fitbit.LOL--
Moderator edit: personal info removed
That's a really interesting question! I had an interesting situation with that too.  Last night I went to bed well past 11 and it registered me asleep at around 10:30.  I don't know if it just assumes that you are active or asleep based on your movements or movement around you but I really think it's not quite a perfect science.  At least that's my opinion!  Good luck!
Hi,My son has as a 5th year secondary school research project, chosen to investigate if there is a link between the amount of exercise taken, and the quality of sleep.I thought I would reach out to this community to see if you would be willing to share anonymously your activity and sleep data.to have as rich a data pool as possible, I am looking for people who- have a fitbit device with a Heart Rate monitor- have routinely worn it to bed to track their sleep patterns in the last calendar month.No personally identifiable information will be stored as part of the research.If you would be willing to help, can you please respond here and at martin@carolan.beMany thanks in advance for your helpMartin Carolan
Has anyone seen the BASIS tracker in action?
I've stopped wearing the wrist band because the velcro tends to catch on my blanket and pull the thing off. That means I wake up and have to reattach it.  So it has become counter-productive in terms of the sleep efficiency.  I am doing like Burgundy and putting it on my bedside table just to track the time.
Welcome to the Fitbit Community, @Sychnant. I appreciate your assistance @JohnnyRow.
 
@Sychnant It's weird that your Fitbit device tracked sleep and steps at the same time. You can perform a restart as instructed on this help article in case that there's a glitch with your device.
 
Catch you later.

I have used my Fitbit Inspire HR for a couple of months  now and like it.  I would like to know why my sleep pattern graph did not appear today and the sleeping "rating" did not appear either.Does it have anything to do with my phone not having power?  My phone lost battery during the night.I like looking at the graph for some crazy reason and I like the feedback it gives me.  Kinda bummed out this morning not seeing it. Please help. Thanks.
That's exactly what I'm doing.  It allows me to 'edit' and I adjust the 'entered bed' time.  When I click 'update' I get the message that a sleep record already exists at that time. I've tried this on the iOS app as well and get an error message.  It's just not allowing me to edit the times..... Thad
Hi @djvibe, Usually, after the beta, it will be released widely. If they do open the beta again, we'd hear about it on Fitbit's beta or blog sites.

The sleep tracking on my HR Inspire is displayed over two separate days rather than a whole night. For example, if I go to bed at 10:30’pm, it tracks sleep until midnight and then begins the “today”tracking separately. I see others see the entire night, from 10:30’pm to 7 am, for example. Make sense? How do I get it to show the whole night?
I am one of the fortunate ones in that as soon as my head hits the pillow, I am asleep. The sleep stages usually show me immediately dropping into Deep Sleep as soon as I go to bed, then later in the night it is a mixture of Light Sleep and REM Sleep.  But, one of the unfortunate things about age is the frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom, so there are several periods of Awake scattered throughout. One thing the Fitbit has shown about my sleep habits, though, is that one days that I am unable to do physical activity of some type, I have a lot of periods of restlessness throughout the night. My wife also notices these periods of my restlessness and encourages me the next day to get out an exercise so she can get some sleep the next night.
In trying to figure out the vagaries of my sleep tracking results, I found this article that does a really good job of explaining the difference between sleep trackers and polysomnography, and what you can reasonably expect from current wearable technology as well as results from various studies and the author's personal comparison tests.  The bad news: Sleep trackers have their limits. The good news: Fitbit tested the best!  https://www.nosleeplessnights.com/how-do-sleep-trackers-work/
Many nights I'll read or watch TV prior to going to sleep and my Charge 3 counts this time toward my sleep score. I edited the sleep time from last night to be more accurate but while it did adjust the time correctly I lost my sleep score as well as the sleep cycle, oxygen graph, etc. It went from having the sleep score screen with the Sleep Score, Deep & REM and Restoration buttons to just having a sleep pattern, start and sleep quality notes. Is there a way to edit the sleep time AND keep the other information?

@JeanetteLM I understand what you are saying, but nothing on Fitbit is meant to interpret or suggest anything. It is data that you can use to improve whatever areas you feel need improvement. It is just a read out of what you do or don't do. So as far as sleep goes, it is telling you how you are sleeping. You say you know you are awake during the night and you are exhausted. Looking at your history are there some nights that you sleep better- is there anything about that night or day that was different than the nights you slept worse.. this is the information it is giving you. The what to do with it is up to you.

I'm sporting a Fitbit 5. What a great gadget, super happy! I've got medical complications, so the Fitbit 5 really is a plus. Its accuracy in detailing breathing, Sleep Pattern, Oxygen levels are really useful and 24/7. I think the ONLY thing missing on the Fitbit 5 is blood pressure!  it seems to be the one thing most doctors check first, so I am wondering why Fitbit, with all it's gadgetry, doesn't include it. Surely this can't be difficult? Can anyone update me on this?, as to why not?  For the rest, a very very happy user.  MH
I found that if I have had a large meal and/or lots of carbs JUST before bed, even if I could put myself asleep, I usually overslept the next morning, dismissing my alarm in my sleep without myself noticing and would feel super tired all day long. People said it possibly due to body busying in digesting during my sleep and those blood sugar issue affecting zzz quality, making my body not fully resting through the night. Should this sounds familiar to your daily habit, you might wanna try finishing your meals earlier before bedtime (not sure about how long should it be, perhaps 3-4hrs?). And not ending your day with a full stomach.
When I have had a really good nights sleep I have seen 7 to 8 hours sleep time. But if you toss and turn it will record that is a restless moment.  Thats my understanding of it anyway.
Anyone else think they should keep track of your sleep cycles and have an option to be waken at an optimal time based on when you go to bed, how resltess you are, and what part of your sleep cycle you are in?
@SweetHeat  Which device are you using and which mobile app - Android or iOS? I might check my Charge sleep on my Android, but it doesn't alway stop the sleep session. If it does, by the time I'm back to bed, it picks up that time. You can always edit your sleep log, too. Welcome to the forums.

I'm not sure what type of conversion your reffering to @Sheeshee. If your awake, are you really sleeping? This awake time is something your sleep monitor should know about and would show up in a professional sleep study. Several users have worn their fitbits while participating in a requested or non requested sleep study and found that their Fitbit sleep record was remarkably close in accuracy in the produced graph. If I was going to discuss my sleep habits with my doctor, I would show him my phone and the sleep graphs Fitbit produced My doctor is smart enough to understand what he is looking at. When it comes to sleep a it is very common for the body to switch types of sleep throughout the night.You might want to read the sleep FAQ. What should I know about sleep stages?Learn about the sleep stages you cycle through at night I went ahead and moved your post to the sleep board
Greetings!  This morning, as an experiment, I noted the details of my sleep data, deleted the log, then put the sleep times back in.  I was hoping that instead of giving me sleep stages it would give me the non-detailed data which include number of times awake, number of times restless, and total minutes of time awake/restless.  But that didn't happen.  It recreated my data with the sleep stages and gave me a sleep score.  HOWEVER, somehow in so doing, it increased my "time asleep" by 5 minutes, added 14 minutes of REM, decreased light sleep by 8 minutes, and decreased deep sleep by 1 minute.  These changes altered the sleep score from 79 to 83, raising it to "good" instead of "fair."  I wish I had thought to make a screenshot, so I would know in what ways (if any) the overall profile of the sleep session had changed.  This surprised me, that the algorithm would look at the identical data and interpret it differently from one time to the next.

Same here; On sensitive the charge suggests I am restless most of the night, ~50% of restless periods are 11 mins. Suspicious number are multiples of 11. Then times I KNOW I was awake are not registered, eg last night I woke up too hot around 3am, got up, found a fan, clipped it onto the shelf above my bed, went downstairs, got water, came upstairs, didn't get back to sleep til nearly 4... Fitbit shows it as a few brief awake minutes. I've been running argus sleeptime on my iPhone since the Fitbit is so off, and indeed without being strapped to my arm, without walking around the house with me, or up and down stairs, just from the movement of the mattress, Argus sleeptime registered that I was awake for exactly the period I know I was awake.I've tried Fitbit on "normal" and that tracks nothing. Almost zero restlessness or awake time when I know there was.On sleeptime I often see 60-90min sleep cycles on the graph, and when those align with me coming to consciousness I can verify that they seem fairly accurate. Fitbit on the other hand shows random series of brief sleep/restless/sleep/restless.. Sleep periods rarely exceeding 1/2hr. Just doesn't match my experience ever.Fitbit help articles suggest you "choose" which of the 2 settings seem right to you. So I'm meant to decide whether I get 8hrs of sleep or 3hra of sleep? Isn't that what the device is meant to tell me?I think the 11 minute thing is a huge clue that the sleep tracker is badly buggy and hasn't been fixed.
Hi @philchenevert, I think the easiest way is to print them off of the web dashboard: https://www.fitbit.com/sleep You can print the weekly charts, or go into each day and print that night's report for any night you want to share.

My fit bit versa is not tracking my sleep. I've tried everything.
I find it helpful  to workout in the morning so I set my goal to spend atleast 20 minutes in my weekday workout. If I do not have enough time in the morning before work, I tried to workout as long as I can. For example, if I only have 5-10 miuntes to spare in the morning, I commit to workout for 5-10 minutes and I complete the workout in the afternoon with another 10 minutes.  Once, I start working out (even when I am tired) I end up working out longer then 10 minutes.  I workout the full 20 minutes sometimes I workout longer.
Hello @Marie_Hgl, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for the information! 
 
Your body doesn’t just hit each sleep stage once a night, nor does it spend an equal amount of time in each of them. In fact, it cycles through all of these stages multiple times a night. Each cycle lasts, on average, 90 minutes, but some cycles can be as short as 50 minutes and some can be as long as 100 minutes or more.
 
Cycle 1: During light sleep you’ll dip into stage one and transition into stage two. Then you’ll move quickly into deep sleep, where you’ll stay for a while before going into 10 minutes or so of REM. “It’s very hard to wake up from deep sleep, which is why your body tries to get it over with as quickly as possible. 
Cycle 2: You’ll get slightly more light sleep, still a lot of deep sleep (but less than before), and a little more REM.
Cycle 3: You’ll probably log a lot more light sleep, a little bit of deep sleep, and more REM.
 
After this, during the second half of the night, the cycles mostly break down as your body alternates between light sleep and REM for the rest of the night.
 
Let's see an example: 
 

 
On average, light sleep will take up about 50 to 60 percent or more of your night. Whether you get more or less light sleep isn’t really going to affect how you feel too much, because it’s just whatever time is left that’s not spent in deep sleep or REM. 
 
Deep sleep, on the other hand is likely to take up 10 to 25 percent (depending on your age) of your sleep.
 
REM makes up about 20 to 25 percent of your nightly sleep and mostly takes place in the second half of the night. 
 
I also recommend visiting this link under How do I use the sleep stages benchmark?
 
Hope this information can help! Let's see if other users can share their inputs too!

I got it my last night. Until I saw this thread I thought maybe it was because I synced fairly to the time I got up as opposed to waiting longer.
Sheri, Some people switch to the dominant wrist at night just to give their skin a break, and others never change. It really doesn't matter what wrist you use, as long as you are consistent. Sleep readings are not exact, but if you compare readings from the same wrist over time, you'll see meaningful patterns. Have you ever watched a dog move its paws while sleeping? Apparently you are doing some of that 😉 For this type of question, you might have gotten a quicker answer if you'd posted to the Help Forums. You can also type keywords in the Help Forum search box, and you'll get back lots of interesting reading. Welcome to the FitBit community! If I've answered your question, please mark my post as a solution.Best wishes,Louise
Wow. When reading this it makes me wonder about my own sleeping pattern. 24x restless and only 43% effective sleep. I feel okay when I wake but get tired by 3pm and get a migraine if I'm not asleep by 8-9pm. I have no idea how to improve my sleep, but have been reading other threads about sleeping patterns, hopefully I can find some help.

Hey guys, @DavideFitbit@EdsonFitbit! Yeah it is a lot, I recommend you guys to give it a try whenever you have the time, like vacations! It's like your body regenerates while sleeping. I know that is not really healthy to sleep a lot every day, but a couple of times is alright.

Do you think this is something Fitbit can fix? I just discovered exporting data and I plan to do it monthly to notice paterns. I noticed a signficant blip in my sleep one day. And mannually going in to edit sleep is not something I want to do.  Are you aware of any other things this happens for? I want the data to be reliable
Hi Wilson
 
Yes it's very odd indeed! Especially since I"ve posted about not getting detailed info, no moderator mentioned or asked about 'begin sleep'.  I posted another question regarding what happens if you get up frequently in the night, does this trigger fitbit to sense you are awake. 
 
Thanks
Patti
 
I get up 2 or 3 times at night (get out of bed and walk). Will that trigger fitbit (inspire hr) to sense I'm awake? I"ve read some post that once you get up and go to the bathroom fitbit will stop tracking your sleep and then it wont start again.

Bed at 11pm but FitBit doesn't starting logging until 2-3. Started a week ago, prior to that it was logging fine. Suggestions?
Welcome aboard new buddy, @AlexL321! 
 
Thanks for sharing those stats. I'd like to mention that since your overall sleep score is a sum of your individual scores in sleep duration, sleep quality, and restoration, for a total score of up to 100. You might have to improve in quality and restoration to get 50/50. Even though the more you sleep, the better your score is.
 
Looking forward to see you again in the near future.

Hi! Last night while i was laying in bed about to sleep i kept getting notifications from facebook messenger. I thought it would be a great update to have a "restful sleep" option, for example if you selected this option you will not get any notifications from 8pm-7am for example without having to manually turn notifications off every night. Thoughts? Simone
I wouldn't read too much into any of these stages--just something interesting to look at. This is anecdotal, but I am way above normal REM levels for my age and I'm not irritable, angry, depressed or anxious. Most people think I am too laid back....
Do you have someone sleeping in bed/next to you on a regular basis?  If yes, ask them how you sleep?  This is probably the easiest way to avoid a sleep study. My wife told me to go to the doctor after shaking the bed all night when we first started dating at which point they put me on some RLS medication and it worked wonders.
I've never had any trouble to fall asleep in the past, but having a lot on my mind or using electronics before going to bed has really started to have an impact on the time it takes me to actually fall asleep. 
 

 
 
I do believe that creating a bedtime routine or practicing some good bedtime habits will have you waking up feeling better and more energized.  🤔
 

 
Feel free to share if you have any good habits or routines that you practice before going to bed. What helps you to relax and fall asleep naturally? Let me know!  😁

I'm using the fitbit flex and using the android ap.  Can you please tell me how you changed the sleep settings from normal to sensitive?
Mine didn't look like either of these. Now it looks like the second one. My old one gave me a time line that was very useful. I could see what time I was restless or awake and chart it. Figure out why at the same time every night I was waking up. It now only shows when I went to sleep and woke up.
I got diagnosed with sleep apnea 2 years ago. I wear a CPAP every night and sleep very well. It was a pain to wear a mask at first but I am used to it. It's WAY better than having barely any energy, not thinking clearly and having massive headaches. I started using a fitbit a couple months ago and according to it my sleep efficiency is 98%. I know someone mentioned a UPPP to try to solve sleep apnea, not every one is a candidate (I wasn't, not enough soft tissue), and I'd advise against having unneccesary surgeries. Again, a lot of people say they cannot wear a mask, just saying it is possible to get a good nights sleep with one on, I know I do. Best of luck.
maybe your bed is too small.
go into your settings and change.
I have often several months ago seen sleeping heart rate recording down to 33 with RHR 37 (probably because of an arrhythmia), but it did not cause any discontinuities.  This was with a Versa 2.  Not sure, but I doubt the specific model matters - much of that is handled on back end at Fitbit and in the app.  But I suppose it possibly could be the Fitbit model.I wonder if perhaps yours slides around on wrist causing the discontinuity. 

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Exactly! I think the adrenaline makes the most sense. I often have thefeeling of being wired up and take a while to come down. But even when Idon’t have times like that I have the above-resting at night.Over the years I have had a few incidents of intense chest pain in themiddle of the night. It has not happened in at least a year. I’ve alsofainted a handful of times over the years. I had the basic tests ran. ECG,EKG, Holter monitor (also to look for the skips and flutters I feel attimes). Nothing was ever found. Anyhow, thanks a bunch for responding. I’mprobably going to try to get to the doc next week because my mother didpass in her sleep (unexpectedly) several months ago and that’s got mewanting answers even more. Take care!
@Gillybean, did this problem go away?

I no longer show a sleep score.  Do I now have to pay to get one?
Check your model. Some don't respond to the switch between normal and sensitive. May just be the models with heart rate monitors. In my own case I'm averaging over 30 times of 'awake' each night but don't know if this figure is significant or not. While Fitbits do provide data, and this is rather interesting, it's not all that clear what counts as exceptional.
I'm not sure that there is a "normal". This help article gives some background on the subject: http://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068
Below are my latest three nights of sleep. I have had a heart issue known as preventricular contractions and my cardiologist sent me to a Sleep Clinic for one night and they told me I had sleep apnea despite the fact that my fiance has never once mentioned that I stop breathing and so I was a little suspicious because the Sleep Clinic also rents out CPAP machines. I am not a good sleeper in any case and I don't really know how to read this chart because it says variations in green are minor variations but the minor variations look fairly major and it might be possible to have a minor form of sleep apnea which might be remedied with a CPAP machine. If anyone has any thoughts with my charts please share and post yours. This is not personal information so I don't know why anyone would care.

So, shouldn't they develop the app?@Merkillin Firstly the Graphs I'm producing are on a computer screen and aren't from Premium. They are only Custom Activities which produce the Graphs like a manual activity. The downside is it averages the calories over time and you may lose Active Minutes. If you need to analyse your steps and pace your click on the Large Stopwatch and create that activity and examine the one minute graphs there. The future is phones so Fitbit should be putting more emphasis on those. Also now that you are in the Weekly Premium trial, if you discontinue that there is a good chance you can't adjust your Calorie Burn Goal which, while in Premium is Activity Cals (Trainer) goal + BMR. We will worry about that if you doin't continue with Premium. I use Firefox and Chrome on the phone and can create the graphs via that if necessary.

I was wondering the exact same thing and went on a search... Recommendations by National Sleep Foundation:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29073398Adults 7 - 9 hours is recommended, and 6-10 hours may be appropriate for some individuals Quote: "Adult: 26-64 yearsOverall health and well-being, as well as cognitive, emotional, and physical health, were considered when voting on appropriate sleep durations for adults. Seven to 9 hours of sleep per day is recommended for adults by the Panel. Results indicate that the Panel believed that slightly shorter sleep durations might be sufficient for emotional health. Both convincing and weaker scientific evidence for adults informed the Panels’ recommendations. The Panel recognized that sleep deprivation is widespread and increasing in the adult population. Restricted sleep time particularly affects 45- to 54-year-olds, the age range when time at work usually reaches its maximum in the life span. Sleep deprivation’s adverse effect on multitasking performance, weight regulation, job safety, mental health, sugar regulation, blood pressure, and cardiovascular health was noted, particularly with nighttime sleep deprivation during the workweek."   The appropriate sleeping time per individual apparantly can only be determined by "how you feel".In other words, you need more sleep in case of: Impaired memory, difficulty solving problems, trouble focusing, depression, weakened immune system, fatigue, increased pain, etc. In a 2013 poll, the average hours of sleep needed to function best varied per country:6h58 jJapan, 7h13 US, 7h20 UK, 7h22 Canada, 7h31 Germany, 8h15 Mexicohttps://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-polls-data/other-polls/2013-international-bedroom-poll In general 7,5 hours of asleep time seems to be the concensus across difference sources (with a minimum of 7, and often 8 hours is cited), The Psychomotor Vigliance Test (PVT) has been found to correlate well with fatigue.However, the test can be taken for different durations, and all durations are not comparable amongst eachother (so use always the same test). So, to test your fatigue after a nights sleep to determine your actual fatigue/sleep need might be interesting, this can be done here:http://www.sleepdisordersflorida.com/pvt1.html#responseOut I can't find a good source to state what makes for a good Sleep Efficiency (the time spend in bed that you are actually sleeping), but one source claims that 85% is considered to be normal, above 90% very good, and below 85% poor:Sleep Efficiency:https://www.verywellhealth.com/sleep-efficiency-3014912 You can train to increase your Sleep Efficiency by all the known recommendations, but also by CBT, first restricting your time in bed to time asleep, and then slowly increasing it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy_for_insomnia  General information on how to interpret a sleep study can be found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4246141/ If I look at the Fitbit benchmark (which is different per age group and gender), I end up with a normal awake percentage of 5-20%, thus a Sleep Efficiency of 80 - 95%. So let's take the 85% Sleep Efficiency, which is considered to be normal, together with the recommended asleep time of 7,5 hours:If 7,5 hours is 85% of time in bed, this means that you need to stay in bed for 8 hours and 49 minutes to get the minimum recommendation, In conclusion... Also I am quite shocked at this... devoting 9 hours a day to sleep on top of a full time job every day is quite demanding.  (AKA: If up at 6 = bed at 21, up at 7 = bed at 22, up at 8 - bed at 23). I am curious on how other people tackle this... do they really spend 9 hours in bed?
@Destabilise That must have been very disturbing to wake up to. Luckily I don't get nightmares all that much anymore since I got a way better hold on my anxiety.

Why does the fit bit show steps counted when I was alseep and not wearing it?
Does sleeping with music playing (ipod) affect the sleep/awake record@
I'm very aware of that. I was under the impression alcohol has a negative effect on sleep, not a positive effect.
This has been discussed a couple of times. I had the same problem and also went with the work-out "wallet" sweatband. It has worked really well and I don't even realize I'm wearing it at night. A couple of folks mentioned buying inexpensive wrist bands at the dollar store cutting a small slit in it and sliding the one in there as well. Good Luck!
I got the Parrot and it's....100% not accurate. According to it: "Parrots tend to keep a consistent bedtime, and don't sleep too early or too late. They typically reach sound sleep quickly, and usually get a good amount of sleep each night. Once they drift off, Parrots sleep deeply, but they can be light on REM. This is because they may wake up briefly throughout the night. Most of these wakeups are so brief they might be forgotten, usually leaving parrots with an adequate amount of sleep to avoid naps the next day."I take several hours to fall asleep, I often end up getting 6 hours or less of sleep and I'm an incredibly light sleeper that will wake up to the slightest thing. I'm also very low energy and frequently nap across the day to stay functional plus I never sleep at the same time every night.... nearly every single thing it lists is the opposite of how my sleep is haha
@Jimm1 wrote:Out of all the fit bit products which one is most accurate and recommended for sleep tracking?Personal opinion ... the Charge HR or the Surge.
When I wake up, I copy, y sleep data into the Sleepmeter app to make calculations,  so I prune off any excess Awake time at either end. It often moves the sleep stages around after that, even though all I've done it set it to begin and end when I'm actually asleep. It's some sort of bug. Fitbits are very approximate at calculating sleep stages, anyway. There's been research showing that they're way out for deep sleep in particular. They don't have electrodes on your scalp, they can't actually calculate REM and such. If you're dozing for the last hour, that's stage 1 sleep. People often think they're awake when they're not during that type of sleep. I get this in particular with naps, and oftrn start my naps by meditation. It's interesting to see which times Fitbit thinks I was napping, and which times I'm convinced that I never quite got to sleep. I'm taking it as rest time either way. Plugging the data into Sleepmeter is fun, by the way, since you seem to be a fellow graph addict. Here's the overall chart for my last three months, although I have way more graphs than that, including ones to show me how different factors influence my sleep.
Had watch 9 days sleep function doesn't work and is not lit up on watch says no data how do l rectify this.
*this is a re-post because I clicked accept solution by mistake* I like everything about Fitbit except the way it calculates time spent asleep. Since 10 or 20 pc is normal “awake” time during the sleep cycle this time should be part of time spent “asleep.” When a doctor or researcher recommends 8 hours of sleep, I believe they mean sleep from, say, 10 pm to 6 am. They do not mean sleep for 9.4 hours because 15 percent is going to be deducted. It’s frustrating getting numbers that make it seem like I’m sleep deficient when I’m really not. For instance if I sleep 8 hours, Fitbit says something like 6. At best, if I want to discuss my sleeping habits with my doctor, I’d have to do a conversion which is inconvenient.
My REM is typically really great. My awake time  and deep sleep are awful and I feel tired 99% of the time. Ive tried many things but nothing has helped. I'm unable to take pills so that limits what i can take.
Yes I had the same problem last night.  The first 2-3 hours were not recorded.  Hasn't been a problem until today - first week of owning Versa.
@writer1gal  Everyone is different. Read this thread - click FitBit can help you better understand your sleep patterns, but if you feel you have sleep apnea, you really should get medical advice. Being tired when you wake up can be due to a number of things, including having a baby to care for, being pregnant, worries, or other things. It's hard to know just why you're tired unless you talk with your doctor. Aenemia can cause you to be tired. Certain medications can make you tired. Too many variables.

Occasionally I'll sleep a solid 6-7 hours... Get up, look at my fitbit sleep stages, and then fall back asleep for another hour or two. Sometimes after my 'first sleep' (6-7 hours - most of the night), my fitbit shows specific sleep stages. Say, 'deep sleep' from 10:45pm - 11:15pm... Or what have you. But when I check it later after my second shorter sleep, it COMPLETELY changed into a different pattern.  Why is this the case? Why should a later sleep completely negate earlier calculations? It just makes me question the accuracy of the sleep tracker...
HI @Cheri0830 Is this your first Fitbit or are you comparing sensitive an older tracker? More information helps to better answer your question.

My father passed along his insomnia to me; yet, I never suffered from it until I turned 49. I suspect it really has more to do with my having to use the restroom and then not being able to get back to sleep.  I've taken fenergan - which is spelled incorrectly - prescribed to prevent nausea from a pain killer, prescribed after a hernia repair. One of these, and I tend to sleep through the night - but when I wake up, I'm pretty drowsy until about noon.  I've read a lot about sleep this past year. Here are a few tips - most of which are common sense, some maybe not so much.  A blindfold/sleep mask - I wear one on the weekends. It helps me sleep past when the sun cracks through the shade. I put the alarm clock on the floor so I can't see it when I'm reclined on the bed. I can reach down to turn it off when the time comes. Binaural beats - there are a lot of apps that supposedly induce the delta waves our brains require for sleep. I certainly fall asleep faster with them - but they don't do anything to keep me from waking in the middle of the night with a full bladder. If I go to bed at 9, my last fluid/food intake is at 6:30pm. I do nothing else in my room but sleep - and if necessary, some laundry folding. I don't work out after 5pm. Stress - I honestly think this is a big part of my insomnia. I tend to think, rethink and overthink every thing, when it really doesn't do any good. I can say with certainty, the fewer money troubles I have, the better I sleep. If my credit score is over 740, I sleep all through the night. When it's been dinged due to high utilization because my work doesn't pay the bonuses when expected, my sleep is impacted. When my daughter moved to Denver, this also had a short term impact on my sleep. When my other daughter got married and bought a house, I slept a little better. Nutmeg - I haven't tried this, but will try it tonight. Nutmeg!

I like the new bedtime reminder feature on my One, but it has previously only been a visual notification on my phone (android). Today it started using audio, I assume there was an update. I haven't figured out how to turn that to silent, can anyone make a suggestion for that? Thanks much!
I manually start and stop my sleep because my FitBit doesn't start automatically. I have to click the I am awake button to stop my morning tracking. I would assume it would continue to monitor when you were up until you marked you were awake.
@MakMak Thanks. You are telling me that basically all fitbit devices use heart rate motion? All fitbit devices? can you think maybe there is different device not fit bit that could track sleep instead?
Hi,I am a night owl and it's very difficult to wake up early. I am trying to force myself to wake-up early like around 6-7 am, managed to do that 2 days and I am already feeling better.    jiofi.local.html  tplinklogin isitdown
So I had kind of suspected this ever since I got married (5 years ago) but the Fitbit charge confirms it - I don't sleep well when I'm not alone in the bed. When hubby is in the bed with me, I am restless over 20 times and only get about 4 hours of sleep in the 8-9 hours that I am in bed. When hubby is not there, I am "only" restless 10-13 times and get about 6 hours of sleep. Surely I'm not the only one affected like this, right? And he doens't snore, and I'm probably more of a restless sleeper than he is, but it seems that I wake up more and sleep more lightly because he's there, moving around to some extent, kind of "keeping me awake." The past couple of months I have been getting sick a lot and very tired, so I'm thinking of moving to a different room to sleep better (maybe a couple of nights a week) but that makes me so sad!! Is anyone else experiencing something like this?
 
Moderator Edit: objectionable content
The hair elastic is a good idea. I use the fitbit holder with belt clip and clip it on the wrist band as if it was a belt on my wrist. It's a little bulkier, but it stays in place.
Anyone out there have the issue of not being able to stay asleep? I can fall asleep just fine but actually sleeping through the night is really tough for me, any suggestions? Thanks!
Hello @Puppypal. @Cooperscoop. Welcome to the community forums. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to report the inconvenience and following the recommendations on a post above. @Puppypal Regarding your question, I'd like to let you know that past data may not be recovered, but the issue that was affecting sleep is now resolved; therefore, your sleep data should be syncing.
 
@Cooperscoop Same as above, the sleep inconvenience was resolved and your sleep data should be syncing. If this is not the case, I'd recommend that you both contact our Support Team for further assistance. Note that you can contact them through chat or over the phone, but phone wait times have been longer, so I recommend initiating a chat. 
 
See you around.

Again? Sleep stages missing from last night? Haven't we been through this before?
 
------------------
 
It's been working fine for a while. But not this morning.
 
No sleep records.
Hello friends! To me Working out, keeping myself busy and blackout curtains give me a very good sleep. My only problem is when I use my cellphone before bed, or watch tv this interferes with my sleep so I avoid this 2 things at night. 
 
I hope you find a way to improve your sleeping!

Or alternatively, the highest scores have represented the worst nights sleep.I think this 'score' is a gimick, and I don't see what it's based on. Hi,I also noticed the same pattern: the lower the score, the higher the quality of sleep.
Looking to understand my shorter sleep episodes to see what my typical core sleep length is, for starters at least
@lnhoran: Almost a week ago, my fitbit app showed me to update both the app and my hardware. So I updated a week ago. I use Fitbit app in my iPad. So may be they are rolling out in stages...
I have difficulty sleeping so I though the FitBit would a nice way to see how bad it is.  It was defintely good for getting an understanding of when my sleeping is better or worse.  However, I stopped wearing it at night because all the sleep advice I've read recommends limiting electronics in the bedroom.  I assume if electronics nearby is bad for sleep than electronics strapped directly to the body must be worse.  I just put it on sleep mode when I lay down and sleep with it on the bed as a compromise.  It doesn't give the details of wearing it but it interferes less with sleep.
For me it is a deal breaker. I noticed my brother wearing the Charge 2 and inquired about it. He told me that feature and since I have had sleeping issues for years thought that it might be helpful with that. So I bought this pretty much specifically for that feature. The fact that it should work each day (accurate or not) should display. If this is going to be used in advertising as a sales point it should work as advertised. Simple as that.
My Fitbit records my sleep initiation an hour or more after I go to bed. My sleep setting is at normal. I toss around a lot at first but I’m sure I have fallen asleep before it says I have. Does this have to do with heart rate having to reach a particular level?
I realise the sleep log data duplicates everytime i open it to view in detail. I tried deleting only the duplicate data. When i refresh, entire log has gone missing. Now my 2 days data is gone. Any idea how to avoid it? and how to retrieve it?

Removing the actual data of weekly sleep average from the app and replacing it with a "score" you then have to pay extra in order to "gain insights" is not adding a feature; it's removing one. And it's insulting.My partner has been suggesting I get an Apple Watch instead. Guess now is the time. So disappointed with this botched "upgrade."
Loved this very honest description - thanks Cande!
What happened to the average sleep number?? I understand the sleep score number but average sleep is more valuable (to me)! Having the average sleep number was one of the last reasons I hadn't switched totally to Garmin (who's sleep functionality isn't as good as Fitbit). Now that's gone.
I tried this but the time that was 'missing' is showing as blank (not awake or deep etc), so adjusting the log doesn't seem to help.
Seems the update came May 1st! Hmmm, seems I'm going to sleep later than I should. The longer sleep was due to post surgery drugs. 😂
Time to sleep and wake up are correct. I do question the minutes and percentage given for Awake, Rem, Light & Deep sleep. I often feel I had a bad night's sleep but the minutes and percentage given all say I am sleeping better than the benchmark times. Anyone else question the accurate of the minutes and percentages given?
Sleeping soundly is rated less than being awakeFor at least 3 nights in the past month, I've slept for less than 3 hours in the night. These nights get a sleep score of 80-90.Other nights when I've slept19.1%  16x Awake1 hrs 35 mins 22.5%  REM1 hrs 52 mins 39.8%  Light3 hrs 18 mins 18.5%  Deep1 hrs 32 mins  Get scores of 70% ish.On all the nights where I have slept little, if at all, it gives me better scores than when I've slept soundly in my bed from start to finish.
@JoostJoost wrote:the total time asleep in my fitbit app is shown without the time awake during your bedtime. Why is that?  10-20% (Benchmark) awake is considered to be normal during your nights sleep. If the time awake during your night rest is not taken into account, it seems to be quite difficult to get to the needed 8 hours of sleep! Any input?I'm going to sound like an **ahem**, but your time asleep shouldn't include time awake as they are opposites.  Otherwise it would just track time at night....
I’m wondering if anybody has noticed that the sleep score has disappeared. I looked at my logs and see that it was there yesterday, but it is apparently gone now, and you can only access it by paying for it.I’ve been using FitBit for the last 5 years, but am now thinking I’m going to upgrade to something better. While I appreciate what FitBit was able to do for me (by providing heart rate, steps etc) I’m feeling that the “bang for the buck” keeps decreasing over time. Interestingly, they continue to get data from me though…
How much do you eat for dinner and how much time do you leave after eating dinner before going to sleep? I always wake up in the middle of the night but can generally get back to sleep fairly quickly. But I find that if I eat too much for dinner or too close to bed time (less than 3 hours), it takes me 2-3 hours to get back to sleep after waking up. Bit counter-intuitive because one does feel a bit sleepy after a big meal, but if your body is busy digesting it will impact your sleep.
Heather, How do I get a sleep score.   Mine just says no score.  susanbazeluk@msn.com
To find the update, first I searched on "Fitbit" in the AppStore search function. This listed the Fitbit app, and it had an "OPEN" button, exactly like you expect when it's an app that's already on the phone. Then I clicked on the app in the search results -- this shows more detail about the application. At THAT POINT -- where I would expect to see the "OPEN" button there was an "UPDATE" button! I clicked it, the familiar circle status started filling. Once that completed, it is an "OPEN" button, and when I Open the app the heart rate graphs are now back the way that they should be.
I'm new to fitbit but I have friends that have had one. When they show me their sleep on the app, it shows up as a wave on a line graph that shows sleep stages and when. Mine just shows up as a solid bar on a bar graph with 3 different colors. How do I get the line graph? I've looked all over online and can't figure it out.
I just got the Fitbit Charge 2 for Christmas. For the days I've had it my deep sleep is always at eleven percent or lower. I'm only fifteen and I know deep sleep is vital at my age. I don't understand if this is a sleep problem or if the Fitbit isn't catching when I actually am getting deep sleep. I also realized I'll wake up many, many times in the night. Usually staying awake about seventy to eighty minutes every night. I assume since I've been waking up so often that that's why I'll sleep much longer. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to fix my sleep? I normally go to bed at a decent time (8:00-9:00) Is anyone else like this?
I worked in sleep research , and accelerometers (in the fitbits) are reasonably good for detecting sleep versus awake (about a 91 - 94%). They are rubbish for detecting whether movement happens as part of a sleep state (different phases of normal sleep). Also, for the folks with CPAP, if your CPAP is working as it should, it shouldn't be surprising that you have good sleep efficiencies--after all, it should be putting it back to what would be your normal.
@WavyDaveywrote:Please, don't troll my thread.I apologize. It wasn't meant as trolling. I'll delete the post.

Oh really
I’m also struggling understanding what everything means.
I have come up with a solution that has worked great for months now. I keep the fitbit in its rubber sleeve and slide it onto the loop of my watch wristband. It stays attached easily since the clip on the fitbit is pretty sturdy.
Wow! Thanks for sharing. I’ll definitely try to sleep more from now on. 😯

@AragonAl it is hard to talk about accuracy when you have no access to data on demand. You can't cross-examine results with any other device and neither you can do the on-the-spot test. In such a case, I wouldn't stress too much with the results if even Fitbit isn't confident enough to release the SpO2 feature such as it could be tested for accuracy and verified against other devices.
Same here.
I work 6P-6A, and have for over a decade. Love the job, but I did a sleep study a few years ago. Was told I flopped around when aleepong, and was dead tired all the time. My doc said my sleep-wake cycle was the worst she'd ever seen. As soon as I'd enter REM, I
My flex isn't tracking my sleep accurately. Sometimes my fall asleep time is off, other times my wake up time is off.
David, This is how I understand the sleep tracker, so I'm not sure if it's right but it makes sense to me. If you select the "see more" option of the sleep tile - the next page will tell you how long you were in bed for vs how long you actually slept. Actual sleep time is how long your body was actually sleeping, after the restless minutes are removed from your total time in bed.  My siestas normally add to the overall sleep hours on the dashboard page. They also show up as separate blocks on the "see more" track my sleep page. Every once in awhile the time won't be tracked, if I'm sleeping in a sitting position or dozing in/out restlessly.  Hope this helps!
WowGreat job
@Erica2busy  I don't know what the result will be -- I don't know my husband's password to run an experiment on his phone.  I can say for certain that sleep logs can be edited.  When you tap on the sleep tile, then on a specific day > tap on the   º º º  and edit the sleep time. Here is what to do if checking on her while she is asleep breaks it into a section with sleep stages and a section with sleep patterns.  Delete the log that is sleep patterns, then edit the log with sleep stages to cover the entire time.  Sometimes I nod off on the couch, then wake up and go to bed.  I get a nap with patterns, then my sleep with stages.  After deleting the nap and editing, I get a complete sleep stages log with an awake time added in. I hope this helps.

For how long do you work per day?
It actually is still in the app on the phone.  It is just really tricky to navigate to.  You need to swipe the graph 4 times to the left to get to the graph that we all like.  Then press the graph to get to the average for the week.  I really hope they do not keep this way of getting there, it used to be so nice.  Good news, there are a lot of good smart watches on the market now that hopefully do not force changes on their customers.

I have had my Versa 2 for over a year with sleep data working fine.  However, last 2 nights, cannot get sleep data.  Restarted phone, restarted Fitbit watch twice, refreshed screen 3 times on phone.  Is fully charged & contacts are clean.  Haven't changed wrist position (is not too tight or too loose).  Just changed to Sensitive setting to try that.  All other Fitbit tracking is working as usual with no issues.  Very frustrating!
Great topic @EdsonFitbit  even when I don't sleep so much lol. 
 
The most I've slept was around 15 hours, went to bed at 7 PM and woke up almost at 10 AM , but usually I sleep for 4 or 5 hours . Even when I don't have to wake up early for work, my body automatically wakes up after being slept for 6 or 7 hours at maximum.

That's a very good question, one that has come up before; but unfortunately, I'm afraid I am as much in the dark on that one as you are. Perhaps someone else can chime in to help us both.
It only vibrates when you've reached your step goal. The lights do represent the percent of goal reached - so one light is 20%, two lights 40%, etc.
@Cassie90, I routinely change sides during the night and when I look at my sleep log, set to "Normal", I see an average of 22 restless events per night.  The thing is, I could care less how many restless events I have, all I really care about is my "Sleep Efficiency"; I find if I'm anywhere above 90% I've had a pretty good night's sleep. Last night was a little unsettled: This was a much more restful night:
I tried using the sensitive mode, and my results were similar to yours.  When I use the normal setting, it seems more accurate to how I feel when I get up each day.
I normally keep my fitbit in 'normal' setting for sleep, and things were pretty ordinary. If im in bed for 7 hours, it used to show me asleep for 6 hours 10 min or so. Yesterday night, I put it on 'sensitive' for the first time and it shocked me.Is this indicative of sleep apnea or should I look at the numbers for more days before being sure? I do have allergies and recently had some sinus issues. Today when I woke up, I do feel a little drowsy, but not that bad. I feel like this on some days but I generally dont fall asleep in the day or anything. Overall, I tend not to get enough sleep because I usually dont go to bed for enough time. Any help understanding this would be great.
@Jenjen118 wrote:Just to update: I put the fitbit on "sensitive" mode last night. Still 0 min to sleep..but now only a 67% sleep efficiency. It says I was awake/restless most of the night. With such varying differences between normal & sensitive how do I know which is more accurate? @Jenjen118 I can only suggest you read this link and it may help you decide the most appropriate setting. There are many posts in the Forums of Fitbitters addressing this issue, from those who feel tired when they awake, to sleep apnea Fitbitters, and others trying to resolve the differences.

A lot of us have wondered the same. Here is a thread where it was discussed. It depends too on how you have the sensitivity set. Mine is sensitive, non-dominant and I can be restless more than I thought.

Hi @IsleChile I'm not sure why there is the inaccuracy in your log, but the good news is you can edit your sleep time, so you have an accurate log. While viewing your sleep log, you should see ... in the upper right corner, select that and you will see Edit Log as an option. I hope that helps.

Hi @Meganmx33, I meant the heart rate graphs (which I didn't see above). Basically wanted to verify there weren't drop-outs of the signal. Have you verified your resting heart rate manually using a finger on the wrist and stopwatch? This will tell us if the tracker is possibly reading lower than it should. If the signal looks solid through the night, and you've verified your resting heart rate is really that low, then it may be related to this issue that Fitbit is currently working to solve. 

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
wow, that's lame... I just got the email to join and it is already full..... why send me an email????
I choose the sensitive setting just so I can see the toss and turns more accurately. If I set it to normal, I just get a block of sleep without any details. I'd like a "medium" setting that still has the detail of the sensitive, but isn't so quick to count those restless areas as non-sleep.
I had a sleep study done because of snoring.  I would wake up tired, during the day. as my body got more oxygen I had more energy.  None of the many signs of sleep apnea.  However I was diagnosed as a very severe case.  Now I have a CPAP machine.
Since the lastest upgrade it breaks my spleep intoeither two or three segemnts. Should it be doing this?

It’s interesting how caffeine can affect people … or not. I’m in the “or not” category, I can drink a Starbuck’s espresso right before bedtime and fall asleep like a baby. My family and friends hate me … lol.
Same question for me as well, my wife noticed her sleeping heart rate is higher than the resting heart rate for a majority of the night (60+%). Wondering if this is common or normal.  This is different than mine where my sleeping heart rate is only higher than resting heart rate for 4-5% of the night. She's going to try my charge 3 for a few nights to see o2 saturation to see if there are any blips there that might indicate sleep apnea but I doubt she has sleep apnea.
@Military1428I wish I knew what to tell you. Do you wake up feeling as though you've wrestled the night away or do you feel somewhat refreshed? When I had my device on sensitive, it recorded every movement. Once I put it to normal, there wasn't as many restless or awake parts of my sleep. Here is a thread by someone who also has PTSD. click  You might want to get with them on what they do. Welcome to the forums.

I picked up my first fitbit flex earlier this week and having been using it daily.  I multiple tap it for sleep and wake-up, but this does not automatically log as sleep.  I have been manually logging the sleep each morning.  I am also getting steps overnight for restlessness, and they don't re-set after I manually log the sleep.  Is this correct?
@shipo Interesting to read your comments. Thanks for adding them  - and the pics. Really glad its working for you as a measure. I might have that Apnea thing too but have no CPAP. This is why I wanted the FitBit in the first place - to see if I need an Apnea assessment - to go to the Physician with some data about my sleep patterns. I cannot see from your screen-grabs though how your recorded heart rate coincides with your recorded Sleep restlessness periods as the former is showing against a Morning-to-Evening timescale and the latter is showing against just an overnight timescale. Maybe you have other screens you can see which shows the direct comparison along the same timescales?  I have to use the Windows PC Website version of the 'tools' so it looks different to your App in any case. For me the issue is about getting an objective external reference measure to compare the FitBit data with, and I am not sure how to do that, other than going to a hospital and being hooked up to proper medically accurate sleep measuring equipment - and I think that is rather unlikely to be available to me.For me it is not valid enough just to use the FitBit version of data and to subjectively sense that it is right. I am wondering if FitBIt can make available their Valiidity and Reliability data for this function, and to tell us how they verified that. I think I may ask them soon enough.
Ok.  I was just letting people know about my experience with the app.  Didn't expect people to get so worked up over the fact that I put my phone with that app running on my shelf which is right above and over to one side of my bed instead of on my bed.  I've seen one too many pictures of phones that ended up burning up because of  not being able to get air to the battery overnight. I've got a really nice Motorola X cell phone now that I don't want to have anything like that happen to.  When I switch phone providers in a few months, I plan on taking this phone with me to the new carrier (whatever one I decide to go to).  I use the app as a backup to my Fitbit Flex.   People really need to look at the last line of my original post which I'm going to put at the bottom of this post. Just putting in my two cents here.  Take it for what it's worth.
I had surgery about three weeks ago and it was the longest period without wearing my FitBit in years. I didn’t put it back on right when I got home from the hospital, I used it for the first time last night. I’ve been amazed at how well I’ve been sleeping the past few weeks and thought the surgery helped that somehow. Last night was terrible. Was fitful and woke several times. Was sluggish and tired this morning, even overslept. I’m keeping it off for now. Will try it again in a couple of weeks, but I am pretty sure the FitBit is disturbing my sleep.
No kidding. Me too. I'm doing this on my own.I thought there might be a "social media" type outlet to find others that are willing to talk and do stuff to beat these symptoms.Let's se if anyone else is interested.
There is probably something bothering you or have a ectic life right now. We had to put our dog down and I could not sleep and what helped me an hour before bed I would take 10mg of melatonin and it would help me get to sleep and get a good sleep. Also no caffine after 6 o'clock....
I just bought the fitbit 3 for the same reason for the sleep app.  It does not let me set the sleep or wake up time and it does like 2-3 different sleep cycles.  It does not work at all.  Could use some help too.  Or I think I a going to return it.
While fitbit cannot diagnose OSA, I can tell you that my fitbit is behaving differently after having been diagnosed with OSA and been on CPAP treatment for a week now.  My fitbit never used to automatically read my sleep - I always had to force it into monitoring my sleep, then click the button again when I woke up.  Now, the fitbit is doing this automatically, and it's surprisingly accurate in registering how long I've been sleeping.  So, while it will not diagnose OSA, it appears to be able to provide another data point that you may have OSA.  In other words, if you're fitbit won't automatically track your sleep without your intervention, it may be a good idea to speak with your doctor about the possibility that you may have OSA.
Thank you. This doesnt work for me. When I check later in the day how Fitbit recorded that sleep period it is not treating the removal of Fitbit (prior to shower) as being the end of sleep period. The Fitbit app on my phone clearly shows the time it calculates as being the end of my sleep period and that is not the time I remove the fitbit band.
@asiayeah Nope, doesn't matter if you're in the US or not since a lot of people in the US have yet to see this feature they claim to be rolling out.
I have 12-20 restless periods during the night.. ..most are in the 3-4 hours before I wake up but there's also usually one right in the middle (which I didn't realize until seeing the pattern in the history, cool).  Sounds like I need to look into this interruption of my rem periods
What does this graph suggest?  Notice the many red dots (29).  Is this normal?
I can't speak to how exact it is, but I will say that it's "directionally correct". Every morning I can pretty much predict if my total sleep time will be high or low before even looking at it.  And from that perspective, it's accurate.  After you use it a while you kind of develop a "baseline" of what's "normal" and then try and work from that.  I'll also add that I suspect most of the people that buy a Force for the sleep tracking feature probably do so for a reason, ie. they're having sleep issues.  So I wouldn't be surprised if the values reported here seem lower than normal.
Hi there community, I just checked my sleep - it says I started sleep at 8pm - Lordy I wish.   1:30 a.m.  What has made this happen ?  It looks like I slept alot in fact less than 3 hours sleep  Disappointed

Would anyone have tips to help getting more uninterrupted sleep? I don't mean the short 'awake' spikes that get recorded, but actually waking up and then being unable to sleep for 1h30 or so. I've been trying quite a few things already (even before I got my Alta HR earlier this week). Usually I would never sleep before midnight-1 am, which didn't make for more than 5 hours of sleep since I have to get up around 6 for work. I went through a combo of various things to 'force' my body to sleep around 22-22:30, which seems to work well so far, but now my problem is that I spontaneously wake up around 4 am, as if that stupid body of mine was so used to 5-6 hours sleep max that now it refuses to sleep longer! Moreover, this coincides with the time when I start having to go to the bathroom, and if I don't, I'm aware of the slight discomfort and I go anyway, and walking and doing my business is enough to completely wake me up. -_- (I don't feel particularly well-rested physically, and I wasn't well-rested either before I tried to change my sleep pattern, so my gut feeling tells me that I need more sleep than that). Things I've been doing so far:- No caffeine after 11 am (no coffee, Coke, whatever)- Tea: only rooibos after 2 pm- Blue light filters on all my devices (phone, tablet, computer)- I go to bed around 21:00 with a book, either paper or Kindle or on phone (but with the filter on and low luminosity. (This is what I started doing to sleep earlier, and the phone reading doesn't seem to be a bother in terms of feeling nervous. I can't just go to bed and do nothing, already tried this, and it just makes me feel frustrated --> trouble to sleep ensues)- No drinks after 19:30-20:00, to avoid the Bathroom Break of Doom. I think that if I didn't wake up around 4, I'd be able to sleep through it until 6.- No exercise after 19-20:00. That part is annoying because apart from walking, there isn't much I have time to do before, but...- Sleeping with earplugs on, since I'm sensitive to noise- Sleeping with a mask on, since I'm sensitive to light and can't have actual shutters installed (why shutters aren't a think in the UK still baffles me, but nvm) I think I've got the falling asleep part down, it's been 2 weeks and it hasn't failed me once *fingers crossed*But the waking-up-around-4 part is annoying, all the more because on work days, by the time I can get back to sleep, it's around 6 anyway. I'm at a loss as to what else I could try. Any tips? Or does this just look like my body needs to be used to spending more time in bed, and will 'allow itself more sleep' with time? (Which worries me: we're heading into longer days, and sunlight filtering through the blackout curtains will wake me up around 4-5 even with a mask on my eyes... :/)

I received an email.stating the new. Update for the sleep application and proceeded.with the update for my blaze....upon completing the update the followingredients morning I am not seeing the new sleep chart with the deep sleep and REM sleep tracked AND the day didn't reset to 0 BUT just continued adding on from the day before for steps. Etc. How do I reset back to 0 and why after updating do I not see the new.charts?
Silly question, but did you end your sleep session on your band by tapping it quickly to deactivate sleep mode?

Hi @KatieMidd ! Nice to see you on the Community! Thank you for your information. 
 
Your sleep record/tile will not appear on your app if you don't have a heart rate able tracker or watch paired to your account. 
 
The happens mostly when you remove the device of your account or you performed a factory reset, and didn't setup the device again. 
Or if you logged out of your Fitbit app and then logged in but with another email address. Small changes on the email address can create a new account . e.g your main account is musterman1@gmail.com and you only gave input musterman1@hotmail.com you created another account and therefore your Fitbit device is not on that account. 
 
To check the email address on the account on your app, please tap on your profile picture> account settings>change email address. Do not change the address here, just make sure that the one displayed is the one you created your main account. 
If it's not, log out of the app and then log in again with the right email address. 
Then tap on your profile picture and verify that your Fitbit device is paired to your account if not , please follow the steps in here: How do I set up my Fitbit device?
Hope this helps

@Shirleyy 2-4 hours of sleep out of how many hours of total sleep time.Im averaging 3:58 hours of sleep, but in the last 5 days i only averaged 5 total hors a night of sleep. 20% awake time is considered norma, when you add in the micro periods of awake time.
Please, please, can someone help me?I have the fitbit flex and I have done everything instructed to do to delete the alarm but to no avail.I am retired now and I don't need the silent alarm to wake me at 5am everyday, but I can't get it to stop.I have tried emailing fitbit directly and they have not helped.Thank you (anyone) in advance.
How have you been finding your new bedtime routine, @Flyingpeng - are you avoiding technology and only reading and listening to the radio at bed time now?

	Amanda - a Fitbit Inspire user since 29th September 2019
I do take liquid calcium / magnesium citrate right before bed.  I also have a carb, such as cookie or piece of bread with peanut butter.  I have also started sleeping much better after giving up coffee.  Amazing difference.  Avoiding exercise or a computer / watching news too close to bed time helps too.  I think a racing mind makes it difficult to sleep soundly, and doing something very relaxing before bed helps. Finally, drinking wine or any alcoholic beverages later in the evening disrupts sleep patterns.

My FitBit shows the following sleep 'stages':* Deep * Light* Rem But the American Sleep Association defines:https://www.sleepassociation.org/about-sleep/stages-of-sleep/* Stage 1 (N1)* Stage 2 (N2)* Stage 3/4 (N3)* Stage 5 or REM Similarly - WebMD lists:* Stage 1* Stage 2* Stage 3* REM  Does anyone know how FitBit's Light/Deep sleep map to the generally accepted stages of sleep? I tried to figure it out myself.  Wikipedia states that order should be N1->N2->N3->N2->REM(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep#Non-REM_and_REM_sleep) So I looked at my charts but they seem to largely random.  I found a sequence ofDeep->Light->Deep->Light->REM Which seems to match Wikipedia, but I only found that pattern once in several days of sleep...and I see other patterns far more often. REM->Light->REMAwake->Light->REMLight->Deep->Light->REM Does anyone know how these map to the stages, and why FitBit has fewer stages of sleep than the medical community?
The last 2 nights I have got the same. No sleep score and does not tell me the sleep stages such as REM/Deep sleep etc... This is very frustrating
I was wondering how the ideal range for sleep duration is calculated. Last month my sleep profile indicated the 6.5ish hours was in my ideal range. This month my 7.5ish hours is outside the ideal range. I always heard 8 is ideal. So why is my ideal range between 6 and 7?
Sleep data now takes hours before it shows up in the sleep tab. Shows up on the today screen but you can't edit until it shows in the sleep tab. Has been happening for a few days. Maybe a Fitbit server issue?
have you tried GABA and 5-HTP?   For years, I would rarely sleep very hard until I found these.  They help my brain shut down so I could relax and sleep.
Hi christopher how are u goodnight happy easter

Hi @kate2020  I found some interesting information in this link:https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314?q=sleep+tracking&l=en_US&fs=Search&pn=1 When your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep.  WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NORMAL AND SENSITIVE SLEEP SETTING?For devices that record sleep patterns instead of sleep stages, you can set your device to track sleep in a normal or sensitive mode.In normal mode, when you make significant movements like rolling over, your device records time spent awake. This setting is appropriate for most users. In sensitive mode, your device records nearly all movements as time spent restless or awake. This setting may be helpful if you wake up feeling tired even though your sleep history shows sufficient rest. I hope this helps!
Hello everybody! 😊
 
Sometimes we don't pay attention to this, but your sleep position plays a big role in your sleep quality, which means it might be time for you to switch it up.
 
If you experience any trouble getting enough sleep or if you have an injury, I believe there’s more to it than laying down and catching some Zzz’s. 
 
Note that different sleep positions play a very important role and have different benefits. If you suffer from pan or other health inconvenience, I think you might need to change your sleep position in order to manage it. 
 
Flat on your back: sleeping on your back can offer the most health benefits. This is because it does not only make it easiest to protect your spine, but it can also help relieve hip and knee pain. Adding to this, a pillow behind your knees may help support the natural curve of the back.

 
Sleeping on your side: this is actually pretty good for everyone. Especially if you sleep on your left side, it can help reduce snoring and it is good for your digestion and might even reduce heartburn. 
 

 
 
Lying on your stomach: well, while this is considered a good position for snoring or sleep apnea, the benefits don't extend too much. Sleeping on your stomach can lead to experience neck and back pain, it can also add strain to your muscles and joints, making you sore and tired. 
 

 
 
Fetal position: this position has lots of benefits. This is great for lower back pain or pregnancy, sleeping in this position, can reduce snoring. But please consider that while sleeping in this position, your posture must be relatively loose, otherwise it can limit deep breathing while snoozing. 

In my personal experience I've tried the "Sleeping on your side" position, which has helped me to reduce snoring. 😴
 
Please feel free to share the preferred Sleeping position for you or the ones that you've tried and helped. 😊 
 
Have a wonderful day!

I've moved your post to the sleep discussion board @Brooksy12
So below is what is a typical sleep pattern for me. Week after week I have the same sleep pattern. No matter what I do, I get the same sleep pattern. I only ever get (at most) 50% sleep time no matter how long I am bed. This means, if I am in bed for 10 hours, I'll almost get 5 hours sleep. If I am in bed 4 hours, I'm lucky to get 2.  Now, you might be asking, how long does it take for me to fall asleep. Easy answer, almost immediately. My wife hates it that I can look a tthe clock that says 11:34 and I'll say, I'll be asleep by 11:37 and I am BUT I an super restless. Sleep apnea? I can't say for sure because I've never done a sleep clinic but my wife says I don't really snore nor do I ever stop breathing when I sleep. So what's up. Do you think my sensor is broken? Any thoughts would be awesome.
Hmm weird, I had an original fitbit 'long ago' and I felt like you could switch it back and forth and see the display change.  Maybe my brain is just inserting what seems incredibly logical into my memory though 🙂

After trying the "Get More Zzz" Premium program, I love the few playlists that were included there and I believe those nights were the most relaxed I've got this year. Between college and work, it's been difficult to get a good sleep time. Currently, I've started listening to Chopin's music but, what other genres, artists or songs do you suggest to caught more Zzz? 🤔
@JackP wrote:Can you elaborate on exactly how to create a custom activity ? I presume it would start and stop at the sleep times but I'm not sure how to create it.@JackP Thanks for getting back. To start creating a Custom Activity you 1. On your PC Dashboard2. Click on Log, Activities3. Follow these  4. Then make sure you sync your phone and now we use the Custom Activity from the phone and you select the time frame. The maximum you can analyse is 24 hours and across "day boundaries"5. Tap your Exercise tile on the Phone6. Tap the +stopwatch and fill out the fields7 Sync your phone so that you can view the "full screen" result from your Log, Activities view.    Because this procedure flattens out the calories over the duration time, it will affect any active minutes and you need to consider deleting the activity afterwards. When you see the activity in the Activity list you will notice a Trash can for deletion. You can use the Custom Activity from the Log, Activities on your PC Dashboard Of course you can do this automatically with the Surge and select either Workout or Yoga from the exercise shortcuts. Eventually you will find a happy balance between using the exercise shortcuts, wearing the Surge 24/7 and battery life. Here is a 24 hour example from my Charge HR. I'm still working on "taming" the spikes when I start to move. In this example all of the daylight activity is domesticated walking, shopping, cafe's for a retired engineer.and the last few hours is some TV viewing.

The pineal gland is responsible for melatonin production and melatonin is important for sleep. Light striking the body, not just the eyes, can disrupt melatonin production.So my question.Do the two flashing green lights on the back of the fitbit (mines a charge HR) result in a disruption to melatonin production, and if so does that mean wearing my fitbit while sleeping will actively disrupt my normal sleep pattern?
why isn't my phone showing my sleep?  It used to. It's been like this for about three days
The app explains that “Time asleep is 50% of the score.  It measures how close you are to hitting your sleep goal, which is different for everyone.” If I reduce my sleep goal from 7.5 hours to 7.0 hours, and I maintain the exact same sleep habits as I did before (in which I averaged 6.5 hours of sleep), will my sleep score increase (since 6.5 hours is closer to my new goal of 7.0)?  This seems like a pretty simple question with an answer of "yes," but what do you think/know?
You can manually put your Charge into sleep mode.  Just hold down the button on the side until it vibrates and a stopwatch symbol appears on the display.  I like to lie in bed and read, so it sometimes said I was sleeping earlier/later than I was.  I also track the "Time to Fall Asleep" data, which says "0 min" if I don't manually put it in sleep mode. Just turn on sleep mode when you turn off the lights, and stop it when you wake up.  It still might read some of your inactive time as sleep, but then those times will be listed as separate charts that are easy to delete (I'm not entirely sure about that last bit).
Hard to say if it is wrong or not, but the following help file gives some info on sleep tracking that may help:https://help.fitbit.com/customer/portal/articles/1230068-about-sleep-tracking
fitbit doesn't recommend wearing a tracker on the ankle for any activity. having said that I understand why you do during the day, but not sure why you wouldn't use as intended at night. I can tell you that my feet especially when I am trying to fall asleep or have that "in between" sleep are more restless than the rest of me, for example deciding if my feet are cold or hot and how that stacks up against the blanket. I would try wearing your tracker on your wrist at night and see if you notice a difference over a series of days or weeks..

I am using a Charge 2 but it seems to not accurately record my sleep. When I sleep for say 5 hours it only records just under 2 and seems to think I woke up 2 hours before I did. This has happened a few days now. What causes it and how can I fix it?
If I don't set an alarm, have food in front of me, or have something I immediately have to get up for, I'll sleep 10-12 hours every day, no problem. What in the world would cause such a thing?! I've tracked sleep on an app on my phone, which also recorded if I was snoring. Not a thing. I move around maybe once every 3-4 hours or so. Very regular. And it's not for long. Just a blanket rustle or two and that's it.
No not initially tired but an hour later yes I am, probably couldn't sleepagain though. I've used the early waking to workout
@ttrani01 I'm sure FitBit has a max amount of time it allows for awake time to be considered a part of a sleep segment. Apparently, 45 min is past that threshold. If there is a way to stitch segments together, I'm not aware of it. You may want to check with customer service and if there is a way, they should be able to guide you.
Actually, the meditation suggestion comes at a great time! I just received my new Charge 2 today and will try the guided breathing feature before bed to help calm down and perhaps add to the bedtime routine. Thanks!

There is no solution. I don’t even know how it tagged as a solution since I never clicked on itSent from my iPhone
I love using my charge three for sleep tracking, and I noticed that I can edit the start time and stop time in my sleep log.  My question is how is the start time and stop time defined. Is the start time, the time that you physically get into bed? or  Is the start time, the time that it detects you have fallen asleep? Same question for stop time, is the stop time the time you get out of bed or the time of your last wake up. Example, your alarm goes off at 6 AM but you get out of bed at 6:10 AM, what is the stop time in this case?
I haven't been to one, but family members have, and based on their experiences, I'd think that if the Fitbit data prompts you to visit a doctor, they'll probably assume you may have a sleep disorder and prescribe testing.
Has anyone had a sleep study based on the results of your sleep tracker? I am averaging 3hours 20mins of dark blue sleep a night. I'd like to make an appointment to see my doctor about my sleep so I can get a referral for a sleep study. I'd like to know if doctors see the fitbit as a valuable tool or not.
I've kept track of my sleep numbers for a few weeks, with a brief log of daily activity to try to determine if anything I do influences my sleep.  My nightly effiency on the sensative scale ranges from from 56% to 82%, on the other scale: 90% to 100%.  I can't find any correlation between my daily habits and sleep effiency.  Nor do I know if those numbers are good or bad.  Anyone else have thoughts?
Coincidentally I just watched the review earlier today. Out of thirty days tracking with my Inspire 2, three times it has started my sleep tracking about :90 minutes late. During the time it does tracks, it seems to matches what this reviewers said. He only wore his three nights in his review.
Thanks so much Dave for taking the time to share your great post.  I completely agree about the importance of deep sleep and have been researching trying  to figure out how to get more of it each night.  I've read and heard from more than a few sources that getting to bed before 10pm is recommended and I'd like to shift things around to start doing that. My routine/habit has been  staying  up to late (past midnight.. closer to 1:00am) and  the light from using cell/laptop surely is not helping. It's of comfort to be able to communicate with others who are on the same page.  🙂
Hi Folks.I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnia several years ago and did wear a CPAP for a while but find this very uncomfortable. I am now 55 and sleep is a real issue for me. It is very rare for me to get a good nights sleep. I need assistance in understanding the sleep data that my FitBit Charge generates. If anyone in the community can assist me in understanding the sleep data that would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Brian
Why did they take the Journal feature away! I am very upset about this.  I used it to track many things including new medications and their effects on me.  It was a valuable tool I would use to show my doctor.  It actually even helped him diagnosis me correctly.  For 10 years they thought I had Fibromyagia.  With the assistance of the journal, which I had documented what my body was going through, he was able to diagnosis me correctly.  I was in the process of documenting how I was responding to new medication he was having me try.  Now all that information is lost!! If others found this journal helpful please post as I was told by customer service they listen to our discussions and that would be the place for me to address this issue.
The best way to sleep is be in a really dark room with all electronics turned off.

So you're saying that the Inspire 3, Charge 5 and Versa 4 all still track Sleep stages like REM, Light and Deep sleep without Premium?
Hi there...  I have been wearing the fitbit charge 2 since Christmas day and so far it has never shown me sleep stages.  Is this because you have to have a solid 3 hours without even 1 minute of being restless?  I was really excited to be able to see this data as my old fitbit flex 2 did not have heartrate so did not have sleep stages.  I have double checked my heartrate to make sure my fitbit is recording this all night and it is.  I do not set the log sleep and my fitbit is charged so I am not sure what to do now.  Any advice? Thanks Jen

In the past few weeks the sleep information I used to get from my Fitbit has changed -- and for the worse IMHO. I used to see good information about depth of sleep. Now all I see is a bar showing total time asleep.  And, no, I have not changed sleep from "normal" to "sensitive" mode.  Is there a way to return to the previous sleep view mode?  The main reason I got my tracker is to track sleep quality. That information is no longer available so far as I can tell.

I am having the same issue with the Flex. It syncs everything except sleep.
mine shows 11 minute increments also and I cannot find anything online that will explain that... it is driving me crazy.  Might just return it.  I have been using it for 3 weeks now and I love it, but that single aspect makes me feel as though something is amiss with the accuracy of the tracker.
If you want others to post their charts you should probably post yours first no? You get what you give.
I'm having the same issue.I've tried steps about also, but is still a day ahead (sleep logged for Wednesday night, not tuesday).This is really frustrating as all my data is logged for the wrong day.Please advise.Thank you
Spoiler (Highlight to read)When are Fitbit going to remove average sleep score and restore average timeor at least make it optionalWhen are Fitbit going to remove average sleep score and restore average timeor at least make it optional
It includes all sleep time.  But when trying to analyze, note sleep is always credited to the day on which you wake up, and naps of less than one hour will probably not be detected (without some special doings).

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I have a difficulty in falling asleep and cannot tell what time should the alarm goes off while I am laying on the bed. Sometimes the alarm is active too early that I even didn't sleep. Sometimes it would be too late that I have slept for more than 2 hours in the noon. Since the Fitbit devices track the sleep time (Even though the sleep status wouldn't be analyzed if the sleep time is shorter than 3 hours), I hope it can monitor my sleep time and wake me up after I have slept for a given time. I think that function is quite useful for the people who have insomnia like me. By doing that we can manage our sleep time in a more accurate way. Thanks for your reading and please let me know what you think about it.
regarding Sleep Tracking accuracy, a couple of people have responded to my question about the validity of the Charge HR in thois area by suggesting that ' the Fitbit will overr time work out the accurate sleep recording'. I am sorry but I just don't see how that is possible! Unless the Fitbit is blessed with some advanced Artificial Intelligence and is able to track alteration in brain waves, then it surely must just rely on two basic measurements  - movement detection and heartrate. Well, I can and often do lie in bed motionless and wide awake for long durations. I also can do the same late night on my sofa whilst watching TV. It thinks I am asleep but I am not. Therefore I am tempted to say that, relatively speaking, its a "dumb machine" as I can see no scientific way that it can possibly track sleep without giving the broadest 'measurement' based on movement and heartrate. I would genuinely be pleased if anyone here can supply evidence of the algorithm or process which underpins the sleep tracking function so that I can once agin be confident that it is worth using.

@YojanaFitbit Yes, I was fairly happy when I woke up :D. Weird thing was though, even though I slept (a lot) more then usually, I also felt very tired waking up!? That was a good read as well. Didn't know that daytime electronics usage also could impact sleep. Thing is, I work in IT, so I don't have too much choice in how much time I need to be in front of a computer 😅.  @AmandaGeorge  I just started reading a new fantasy book, The wheel of time. Certainly not a short story. It consists of 14 books 😅. However it is an easy read if anything. The first time I tried reading, just like this time, I was just in bed, right before going to sleep. I of course also ran more, and faster, then I usually do yesterday. So it remains to be seen if it was exhaustion or this new "ritual" before bed that was the key to getting this good nights sleep in.
Hi @anotheruser12 - As far as I know, you can only see that in the Fitbit app on your phone.
My Fitbit charge 2 often says I am not sleeping while my wife says I wake her up with my snoring this is in addition to profile info about my sleep. I to have complained with same answe as you.
I wear my unit so loose that it sometimes flips to under the wrist, and rarely have an issue reading O2 or heart rate. Both of which are used when monitoring sleep.  I also have moved this thread out of hardware help and into the Sleep discussion.
Yes, and I am frustrated that whoever read my Holter printout made no note of this, and my PCP did not press for a specific review of those spike times. It remains a mystery and a curiosity.
Hi Soippi, It looks like we're on the same journey! I also found the ASA report on snoring APPS and tried to download Snore Report, but I can't find it on either the UK or US APP Store.I have downloaded Snore Lab and it is helpful but does not link to FitBit, which is a pity.
Thanks. I have hypersomnia. I have a fit bit HR. Nuvigal and Provigal areboth meds that I have been on. If you have Narcolepsy you should like ourgroup on face book.
I've been using my new fitbit for a couple of weeks to track my sleep. I think the graphs are amazing. However, last night's graph appears to be broken/incorrectly formatted.Is this a known issue? Compare 2 nights ago and last night:http://imgur.com/a/3VpIm Any input would be appreciated!
Which setting are you using for the Flex? Normal or sensitive? I'm not sure how it compares to the One- hopefully someone else will know and answer but I do know many who think the sensitive setting is too sensitive and some who aren't convinced the normal setting is very accurate. I'm trying to decide that myself and that is why your question intrigues me. I hope someone can help you 🙂
My sleep TIME is being recorded, but not the PATTERN.   Any ideas?
@new_change There is a whole area with articles and a manual for the Flex - click to go there. When it's not in sleep mode, your Flex is tracking your steps. One light will show, when you tap the band, for each 20% of your daily goal. Welcome to the forums.

Thanks--It was on clip mode at first, and it's been on wrist mode for several days. It is still not 100% accurate. It will measure sleep until early morning (say 4am) and then stop measuring, even though I am still in bed, sleeping. I never had any issue with the original, old-school fitbit.This device is way too complicated, does not seem very accurate, and it's almost impossible to get assistance online. I called the telephone number, but the poor person sounded like they were in an underground echo chamber, with a gazillion people talking at the same time.
I definitely have come to think that the fitbit interferes with my sleep. I have it on my wrist, with my hands up by my face (close to my brain!), and I have been only getting about 4 to 5 hours of sleep a night. I am no longer going to wear it at night, and I'm pretty sure my sleep will improve.
My top priority right now is to get daytime tracking, I have switched to night shift a week ago, now i need to habit myself to sleep by daytime, so i am want to be sure Inspire 2 (or any other model) does track fulfill this function. Thanks!
Would it be possible to add a comment field to the sleep app?  Something where you could say if you felt if you slept well or not.
They moved the sleep percentage to Premium.  if you want to see it, you have to pay now.  We pay good money for the Fitbit and now they want more.  I loved checking on how well I slept and it is stupid to have to pay extra for the sleep percentage data, which is part of the reason I bought the Fitbit in the first place.

Hey HarperJean, did you have 95% sleep efficiency on your CPAP with detailed mode on? I am so confused with my results, I got 38% last night with 7.5 hour window, 2.5 hour sleep, and when I switched it to normal tracking it was actually 94% efficiency... I don't really know what to believe. I don't feel great, but I always feel like this.my past week has been 90-99% efficiency varynig on normal, but on detailed it's awful 30-50%'s. I could totally see myself not getting enough oxygen considering I am allergic to my cat and take long term oral/nasal medication to clear my sinuses and throat. It helps but it isnt perfect...
Thanks all  🙂I'm glad to know you can also put the times in manually, I hadn't seen that!
Without the app and using only the website, you're limited. There is a whole community of groups that can only be reached from the app. You could ask your mom if you can use her phone to set up your Fitbit. You'd need only to log in and out of the app, so you wouldn't be using your mom's name, which could be confusing for your friends.

Still wondering if Squatticus - or anyone else - has actually achieved 100?  Knowing the metrics is one thing.  Knowing if 100 is achievable is a separate matter.  And knowing specifically what steps to take to achieve it is yet another. (Metrics= If you have $100 and multiply by 10, you will have $1000.  But what steps do you take to multiply it, has it ever been achieved by anyone taking those steps, and is it achievable to most anyone who takes those steps?).
I have the Sleep Number bed app called Sleep IQ. That app allows me to sync with my FITBIT Versa app. However, the sleep number app never reflects my activity synced from FITBIT. So, I went into the FITBIT App on my iPhone 10 to try to sync FITBIT to the Sleep Number app but do not see anywhere to sync it. Can someone help me sync FITBIT APP to my Sleep IQ APP? Thanks bunches!
@JoenickCan you explain a bit more? Welcome to the forums.

I first used Fitbit back when it was Charge (version 1) and then Charge 2 when that came out.  After that, I switched to Polar and then Garmin and some other China brands and some European brands.  I have not seen another app like Fitbit's which tracks my weird multiple-sleep-patterns (I tend to wake up at 2am and sleep again at 5am) as almost every other brand treats my first sleep at the ONLY sleep I've during the night. Now I am back to Charge 4 even though Charge 5 is out.  And the ONLY reason I got it was because of this special ability for the app to track my multiple sleeps at night + naps during the day.  If it doesn't do that, then I am back to Garmin (my favourite, as it tracks my swim the best). What's this I hear about Fitbit charging premium for people to view their sleep patterns?
If you can post the sleep graph, we can take a look.

I have been experiencing this as well! I've been wearing a Fitbit to measure sleep for years (currently using a Sense), and my sleep scores were pretty good - averaging in the mid-80s and sleep stages within normal benchmarks. However I was feeling more and more exhausted during the day, in spite of these pretty decent scores. The HR and breathing variability numbers were spiking most nights so I underwent evaluation for apnea and found I have moderate obstructive apnea.  I've been using a ResMed 11 CPAP machine since mid-August -- I find it very comfortable and have no trouble wearing it all night long. I have gone from 16 apnea events per hour to ZERO using this CPAP device, and I feel a million times better when I wake up and during the day, the difference in how I feel compared with before the CPAP is really extraordinary.  However, my Fitbit scores rarely break 80 now, mostly due to reduced time in deep and rem sleep. It does appear to be correctly tracking HR and respiration variability, because am not seeing any orange spikes any more like I did before the CPAP.  I experimented with setting the sensitivity to high vs normal, but it hasn't made a noticeable difference.  It really seems like wearing the CPAP is interfering with how the Sense tracks sleep stages.  It's puzzling and a frustrating, and has led me to cancel my Premium Fitbit service, since I don't have confidence in the metrics anymore, given they don't seem to relate to my actual experience.  I am sorry others are seeing this too, but it is a bit of a relief as well - I though I was going nuts.
Thanks for the reply, it is really helpful for me to compare against similar individuals. I walk roughly the same steps as you, but usually only jog once a week or less and use a recumbent stationary bike for half an hour a couple of times per week, and since my op have not done anything beyond the walking. This makes me feel happier about my paced night time floor level of 50bpm :).
any advice to improve sleep efficiency?
I was wondering the same thing. Could it be due to sleep apnea?
Thanks for sharing..Samsung? I will check it out..
Thank you!!!
 
Wow..I'm going to try that..the sleep score is rarely coming up..the main reason i bought this was for SLEEP..I had the same problem with the last Fitbit, now with this one.

Do what I did..buy a waveless Waterbed, it's actually called a Sponge bed. I control the temperature with the heater.
i tried some natural drops on the pillow for better sleep. Worked well too
Oh, I know all about that.Here is my thing:I have had RLS since I was 7 years old. I decided 2 years ago to get to "gound zero".No more prescription drugs, supplements or anything, not that I was on much, just Premarin, and some stuff for acid reflux,...BUT major stuff for Parkinson's Disease that was supposed to help with RLS. I went through them all.I am proud to say that I am managing my own health now. No more doctors.I do monitor my sleep with the Fitbit and it has opened the eyes of many people around me who never quite understood the sleep disturbances I was experiencing. I also log my food because I believe that there is an autoimmune issue here. Not quite sure yet, but I eliminated grains and dairy and I am doing great.I just thought I could share what I have been doing with anyone else out there that might be wondering???????Thank you for your reply.
Don't overcomplicate sleep! (It will make you lose sleep over sleep 😉 ). What you describe is perfectly normal and I see the same in my sleep analysis. How are you feeling? Sounds like you were not concerned before you had access to this data. If you feel rested you get enough sleep. Are there days you sleep longer and feel more rested? If so you might want to get a bit more sleep in general. But to me it sounds you are still getting the same amount of sleep as before and are still as rested. If you have a regular pattern (going to bed and waking up similar times each day) and feel rested, I think you have nothing to worry about.

Hello everyone! 😁
 
How have you been? 
 
I believe you know that seasonal allergies, also known as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, can disrupt your sleep in a number of ways. When allergens enter our bodies, an immune response is produced to get rid of the offending allergen. This immune response in turn produces the familiar symptoms and discomfort many have come to know during allergy season. Some symptoms created by these reactions include:
 

Itchy or Watery Eyes
Sneezing or Coughing
Nasal Congestion
Fatigue
Stuffy or Runny Nose

Irritation in your nasal passages can cause coughing or sneezing, which can prevent you from falling asleep, or even wake you with a start during the night. In fact, sleep disorders are often underreported in people with allergies, which can make these sleepless nights even more miserable.
 
Some common allergens include pollen, dust mites, mold spores, or pet dander. Different types of pollen can create symptoms throughout allergy season based on the periods these plants are in bloom. Allergies to dust, mold, or dander can occur year-round in what’s known as perennial allergic rhinitis.
 
Pet Allergies: 
 
A major source of pet allergens is dander, which is made up of dead skin flakes that our pets shed. Others may include saliva, urine, and even blood. These allergens, like others, can be easily circulated through the home, where they can remain on soft surfaces like carpet and furniture for months. We all love our pets, but cats and dogs may also be inadvertently contributing to our allergy symptoms.
 
Sleep Better During Allergy Season: 
 

Shower Before Bed: a warm bath or shower washes away any lingering allergens on your body, as well as helps you unwind before bed. 
Keep Doors and Windows Closed: while it’s tempting to invite the nice spring air inside rather than using air conditioning, you may want to reconsider if you have allergies to pollen. Keeping doors and windows closed will keep extra allergens out of your home, and help keep your symptoms under control.
Adjust Your Laundry Routine: if you’re especially concerned about allergens in your home, there are a variety of hypoallergenic sleep products available to help keep seasonal allergies in check. If you spend a lot of time outside during allergy season, put your clothes into the wash as soon as you come inside for the day. Avoid letting your clothes dry outside, this can attract more pollen and allergens. Instead, put your clothes in the dryer to keep them allergen-free.

Take Allergy Medication at Night: You’ll want to check with your doctor before you do this, but taking any allergy medication at night will make sure that the medication won’t wear off in the middle of the night, and will stay strong while you sleep. If you are taking an over-the-counter medication, check the ingredients to be sure it doesn’t have caffeine or other stimulants that might keep you awake.

I've kept an Excel spread sheet for the past 2 weeks.   My Sleep Eff % numbers have been in low 50s.  Other factors  may play in here too:  1). # of times Restless, 2).  # of times Awake, 3).  Total time in bed, and # 4).   Actual time asleep.      I am unable to tell if there is a relationship between some these numbers which may determine Sleep Efficiency %
I meant the phone app. I completely understand not bringing a pc to bed, but many people bring their phones. I agree that it would be nice for the Blaze to have that function. You can look it up or suggest it in the Feature Suggestions board.

Try again. Fail again. Fail better.
Hi all I was wondering if anyone was experiencing the same issue as me. I've always been a restless sleeper and after  purchasing the Charge at Xmas it proved it to me in vivid detail. According to the sleep setting (sensitive) I normally average 4 1/2 hrs asleep with 15 - 20 restless periods (perhaps 1 or 2 awake minutes) but the weird thing is that 90% of the restless time periods are exactly 11 minutes! Example last night:11 minute sessions x13 9 minute sessions x 112 minute sessions x 118 minute sessions x 1Example night before 11 minute sessions x 109 minute sessions x 313 minute sessions x 121 minute session x 1 This trend goes on and on ever since I started recording sleep. Now I believe this is either a technical glitch or my brain is super strange (a possibility) but wanted to know if anyone else was recording a lot of 11 minute (or similar duration) sessions or if it was just me.Thanks,James
I forgot to mention and I think it's very important:"- 01:00 - 01:30 - sudoku (you can laugh) to kill any processing power left in my brain"I play it on my phone but I set a blue-light filter + blue-light glasses. If you have a sudoku notebook (or actually any other intense brain teasers) would be better.
CPAP users can't move around that much and that may be why the Fitbit is saying your efficency is so high. I know when I used one I felt pinned to the bed and my back (which is why I ultimately gave it up). The Fitbit tracks movement as wakefulness so perhaps that is the reason.
oh great! that makes me feel sooooo much better that i am not the only one! 🙂
I've struggled all my adult life with sleep. I have a genetic/familial low metabolism of unknown origin that disrupts my diurnal cycle and especially sleep. We are small, fidgity, active, lean people. In my late 20s I realized that 2 hours a night was probably a deadly path and took a seminar in deep relaxation and autohypnosis. I couldn't do the autohypnosis, but the deep relaxation was the answer. It's a process of contracting different muscles to experience the tension then letting go and feeling the spread of relaxation. Concentrating on deep and slow breathing pushes other distracting thoughts out. When distracting thoughts come, it's OK because you just notice it and go back to breathing. It took 2 days to learn, a month to master, and has been an important life skill for me for forty years. I can always put myself to sleep within 30 minutes, anywhere, anytime. It usually only takes 5 minutes. My sleep is very inefficient so it takes about 10 hours in bed to get 5 or 6 hours sleep. But by deep relaxing back to sleep after every waking I've been able to get enough sleep to get by. It was a secret technique when I started but there are now lots of books and audio programs out there so experiment! Let us know how it goes!
Same issue. Also there should be a "family" privacy setting...
In the app, or on the website? Because in the app, under the sleep section, I don't see a percentage. Only awake time, restless time, and asleep time.
Thank you everyone. 
I agree that the ideal is to get the vitamins directly form you diet and only get supplements if you have deficit in one or the other. But for that it is better to start with a medical check.
For some reason I seem to flip-flop between getting lots of light sleep and not a lot of deep sleep to getting enough deep sleep but minimal light sleep. This is my record for a week of sleep:Sorry if the formatting is gross or there are duplicates, this post creator is terrible to work. Basically from this you can see that when I get lots of light sleep my deep sleep suffers. When I get more deep sleep, I barely break the light sleep amount. Is there a reason for this or is this normal? And what can I do to stabilise myself night to night?
Hi I've just  checked one of the sources I was looking at and realise that I  was perhaps confused.  https://www.healthline.com/health/how-much-deep-sleep-do-you-need11-13% of total skeep time is actually correct for deep sleep.My apologies
You should be happy that you sleep so easily. I don't think it is a problem, other people that can't sleep much envy you. How long do you sleep when u have to get up for something ?

How comfortable is your bed? I wonder if it's something simple like that keeping you from sleeping deeply. Maybe play with the temperature in your room, the softness/hardness of the bed, your pillow, that sort of thing.
I have this same issue with my Ionic
I've always had difficulty getting to sleep. Once I'm asleep I am fine, but it regularly used to take me several hours to get to sleep. I started using mindfulness sessions online as way to relax and turn off my over-active head.  I did that for several months a couple of years ago, but then I started getting irritated with the  voices of the people doing the meditation and I tried sleep stories for a while and then found I was  staying awake so I didn't miss then end of the story! 😅 Then I discovered Fitbits meditations for sleep and there is a couple of them I find really helpful. I don't listen to them now, but I play the ideas over in my head and it seems to help me.

If Fitbit did this with any/all of their sleep trackers it would put the Withings Aura over the edge to no longer be a viable product. Right now the Aura is probably the best thing out there so that you do not need to have your phone on your bed due to their sleep monitor that sits under the matress. However, it picks up movement from a partner sleeping in the bed. If Fitbit incorperated the Smart Alarm functionality in their activewear then they would definitely take the wind out of the sails of the Aura. The technology is there, the need is there, it is up to the Fitbit SDEs to push it out there; but seriously it is not difficult at all... -Choose time range in which you would like to be woken prior to set alarm time.-If restless activity is found within this timeframe prior to set alarm time then have alarm go off at that moment. Use standard alarm Snooze/Off functions already coded into the watch. Only possible drawback to this would be an Alarm Type option. i.e. Is this alarm a wake up alarm or other?
Good Morning Dave_in_ni: Have you tried a sleeping mask. I sleep with one on. My guilty habit is reading an ebook on my Amazon Fire Tablet. It allows your mind to rest and be in a state to get ready to sleep. when I can't read anymore I can just add the bookmarker and close the cover on my tablet. Or if you are up like me now I like listening to house music before going to bed. Or play Mahjong on my tablet before going to bed. If you don't have a sleeping mask you can use a clean unused dark-colored like Navy-Brown-Black-Dark Green or Red washcloth. What you doing is blocking out the light in the bedroom. It works. I never use sleep aids in medicine, they don't work on me. Another trick is turning on your fan just listening to the fan which blocks the noise. It keeps the room cool and helps you sleep. Or listing to Pink noise or  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Al8valACfA- It's soothing listening to the waves. This might work for you, I still prefer house music. Well, it was nice chatting with you Dave, I hope this helps you. Decaf 2
I started using my fitbit alta HR 10 days ago. I've had very vivid dreams, and in almost all cases nightmares, 7 out of 10 days. I NEVER remember dreams, and may have a nightmare I remember once every couple of years. I can recount all the nightmares during the last week with precise detail. I searched google to see if I was the only one experiencing this, and clearly I am not. I will continue to use and then stop use if this persists. It is difficult to theorize what in the Fitbit device might be causing this.
@JoostJoost wrote:I understand but if the time awake during falling asleep and waking up is not accounted for, it is quite hard to get to 8 hours of sleep per day...Exactly correct! I plan for 9 hours in bed for sleep, and 8 hours of what I call net sleep. We commonly hear to get 8 hours of sleep per night. I can't tell if that 8 number includes awake time or not. (Some of the awake time occurs during the night). The nice thing about sleep is we do it each day. There are lots of opportunities to track how we feel against how much sleep we get. Once we figure out how much sleep our body wants, we can use the Fitbit numbers to help keep on track. I think it's important to have a sense of our body's individual need for sleep, and then use Fitbit as a tool to track progress.

I updated my Fitbit App (iPhone) a few days ago and now all I see are simplified sleep details for the last three nights.  There must be a connection between the app update and suddenly getting only simplified sleep details.  How do I or you fix this? I have a Charge 2.
Yes. That thing is wrong wrong wrong.
Hi everyone! 😊
 
I hope you're having a great day! 
 
Does anyone have any information about Light Therapy? 
 
To be honest, I haven't tried this but I'd love reading comments about it. In the meantime, I investigated a few topics related to this and I have heard that it can relieve sleep issues associated with insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, jet lag, seasonal affective disorder, and depression. 
 
Is Light Therapy Safe?
 
This is an interesting question, I just heard that some people can experience side effects when performing light therapy, including eye strain, headache, nausea, hyperactivity, and skin irritation. Sometimes, the side effects go away on their own after a few days. But if the symptoms continue, it said that it is better to consult a doctor.
 
Doctors may recommend changes to light therapy sessions, such as changing the length, time of day, product, or how close you sit next to the light box. 
 
Can You Do Light Therapy at Home?
 
There are a wide variety of light therapy products that allow to easily integrate light therapy sessions into daily life. It said that we can read, write, talk on the phone, use our computer, cook, and more, all while practicing light therapy.
 
Light therapy boxes come in all shapes and sizes, including:
 

Table lamps
Desk lamps
Tablet-like devices 

And there are more, but light therapy boxes can be purchased online in stores. In some cases, they are covered by insurance.
 
Is Light Therapy Right for You?
 
Light therapy is not considered a cure for insomnia, depression, or other conditions. However, it can be helpful in improving energy levels and helping to fall asleep or wake up easier. It can take a few days to a few weeks to start to notice the effects.
 

 
Can someone please share any experience? 
 
I look forward to reading your comments!

I am doing that now, logging the missing sleep. My question to you is: why do I need to do that? The system can retieve my sleep data from the Fitbit during that time when I have not rested for an hour continuously, why cut that out of the reporting and making me, the customer to retrieve it by hand?
I totally concur with all the folks that recommended not to rely on your Fitbit for any medical occurrence. I also experienced apnea when I started my program at 225 lbs. I am now 180. As some have mentioned, weight loss is very important. I also finally purchased an adjustable bedframe, and by raising my mattress (head side), I have increased my uninterrupted sleep threefold. @luv2pugs wrote:I've been to a sleep clinic and was diagnosed with mild and occasional apnea. I do not see any breaks in my sleep patterns on my fitbit that support that diagnosis. Would it show disruptions in my sleep pattern?
Yes it will. I did that and my scores improved.
I was surprised when I saw my number too, then I saw how long I 'woke up' for and sometimes less than a minute. I decided to set up my own camera study with my trail camera and sure enough I woke up at the time slots fitbit said, well except for one where I just rolled over.
My fit bit thinks I'm sleeping when I'm just sitting on the couch. How do I correct this?
FWIW, I've read that antidepressants can stifle REM sleep (I took the stuff, not just Lexapro, but tried almost everything for 20 some years). But that's different. The lack of deep sleep is happening to me, too. I'm 50 and I sleep for an average of seven hours- if I get *any* deep sleep, I'm lucky. Last night it was only 11 minutes! With everything I'm reading about how lack of deep sleep can lead to dementia and how our bodies can't heal themselves properly without deep sleep, I'm letting the numbers kind of scare me . I thought it was hormones so I fixed that - I don't have sleep apnea, I'm  active and I live like a nun. I'm not really sure what's going on, should we not really trust this figure? I do feel exhausted when I wake up. Really kind of a mystery. I'll bet we're not alone...
Just purchased this product..I am trying to log my sleeping due to back and shoulder issues..I am wondering at what point does the app start tracking my sleep..Ex, I went to bed last night around say 1130-midnight and when I looked this morning it only shows from like 3am to 815am..Does this mean that I was actually up just laying in bed not able to fall asleep all that time.?..I am always moving around due to my issues...Is there a way to tell fitbit I am in bed at such and such time!?!?! thanks in advance

I've had my FitBit Charge HR for a few weeks now. I assume it uses movement (or lack thereof) and heart rate to track my sleep. What I've found is it takes about 2 hours before it thinks I'm asleep. For instance, if I go to sleep about 10:30pm it says I went to sleep about 12:30am. The wake up time is pretty accurate. I would like the ability to edit the sleep record in order to make it more accurate, but I'm unable to do so. When I edit the record to reflect the correct time, it says I already have a sleep record for that time. Should I delete the sleep record and create a new one? Will it still show the 'restless' or 'awake' times if I do that? Thanks!Thad

this is interesting
Hello @Pipporossi  I have numbers around the same, less than 40 times on most times, but around 30 times. This is supposed to be normal. I did a sleep apnea test recently and this did not even raised an eyebrow with the doctor.
I am having the same problem. I have a Charge 2 with current firmware. I was able to see sleep stages on my Galaxy S6 until April 16, 2017. I now have a Galaxy S8 and have the current app. I have restarted my tracker, updated my app with the most current update, logged out of the app and back in, and restarted my phone. Nothing has changed.
Depression screen done? See ur doctor
Hi @negodkin Has the issue with sleep statistics not showing up corrected itself? If not, try restarting your tracker.

I'm looking at getting either a Charge 3 or a Versa 2, with my primary focus being on sleep tracking, though I'm not reverse phone lookup sure how interested I am in the alarm features. Do they track sleep automatically? Is the smart alarm feature nba reddit the only real difference? Will I get the same data with either watch? I previously had a Zip, pcpartpicker a One (fell somewhere between couch cushions and could never be found again), and a Garmin Vivosmart HR (fell off my wrist when the band broke, also never to be found again)....thankyou
I have a tendency to spend long periods awake during the night -- two to three hours isn't uncommon.  The Fitbit often isn't able to discern between sleeping and lying still, so these sleepless times usually get broken up like this:  I know that I was awake and struggling to get back to sleep during this two hour period and wish there was a way to set the device to be more accurate or manually edit this log to better reflect what actually happened.  Instead, I have the app telling me that my sleep score is 82, and it makes the whole thing seem like a joke, because I feel terrible. Right now, the best I can do is to edit the original sleep log so that it ends at the point when I first woke up, and then I can create a second log for the later period that begins when I finally fell back asleep.  But that second log gets treated like a nap, which provides a lot less-detailed data.  And the sleep score ends up based entirely upon the quality of that initial sleep period, which doesn't accurately reflect the night as a whole or my feeling in the morning.
Hello newbie here, sorry if this kind of topic being discussed before here. People said that, an adult should get the best maybe something like 7 hour of sleep per day, but how about the portion of sleep being cut down to certain time. Is that people need to sleep straight 7 hour without any intervention then it is should consider healthy?I mean always wake up in the middle of the night to pee, then i cannot sleep. But to cover that 7 hours, during the day i also sleep a few hours. During brunch and also after lunch and sometimes after tea times.Sleep for the straight 6-7 hour is a thing of past now, (i can do that when i was a teenager or kids), but now being an adult, no matter how tired i am or how sleepy i am, maybe the best i could go 3 hours straight, then automatically i will wake up to pee or else.Is that normal? is that i drink too much water before going to sleep?Sometimes being an adult, i just thought that, i will sleep when my brain tell me to sleep and get rest. No need to follow "the rules" of 7 hour of good sleep during the night.But a few of my friend still can do that stuff, i mean they can sleep straight for 6-7 hours without any intervention, makes me think, maybe i got problem.
I've had my Fitbit HR since March now and I've been sick many times, and Very Consistenly I notice that my resting HR spikes up to "72" and stays there while I'm at the peak of sickness, and comes down when I'm well. Whatever formula they have seems to be extra magical in predicting the onset of viral illness because it starts to go up 2 days before I get any symptoms. Interestingly, the resting HR doesn't directly relate to overnight HR -- my overnight HR is "normally" 54-59, and when i'm sick and my resting HR is 72, my overnight HR is in the mid-to-high 60s. Most people's reactions to this is that the scale of change is insignificant (I'm a scientist / I get comments from other scientists), and I'd agree except that it's alarming precise and these noticeable spikes *only* happen when I'm sick. Anyone else noticing this magical prediction ability and mirroring of illness state??
I am jetlagged, as I just came back from a trip. Last night, I went to an early dinner, had a glass of wine and when I came back about 21:30, I fell asleep until about 23:30. Then I got up, worked for a bit and went back to bed at about 1 or so.My Versa never registered the two hours of sleep I got between 21:30 and 23:30. They were not added to the previous night's sleep, nor to today's.This is a significant amount of sleep and I feel that it should be tracked. I have read that FitBit track three hours and over, but it doesn't make much sense to me, since many people take shorter naps, and my previous smart watches generally were able to track the occasional nap. FitBit generally seems better at sleep tracking than my previous devices, but this is a major omission.I have it set to "Normal," because when I tried "Sensitive," it missed large segments of sleep during the night.Any ideas?

I get something like this once in a while. When it happens, I don't think it's a problem of my sleeping heart rate being too high, but rather my resting heart rate has been incorrectly calculated to be too low. I don't understand how resting heart rate is being calculated and I'm not convinced that it is a reliable number.

I use fitbit flex to track my sleep only. I reacted badly to a prescription medication 18 months ago, completely destroyed my sleep. I use the flex to monitor my sleep and see if various medications I am working on with my PCP helps or not. I use two flex's one on my wrist and one taped to my waist... below is what my sleep looks like now. 37 year old otherwise perfectly healthy male. My actual sleep is somewhere between the two... but the restlessness probably doesn't help with sleep quality.

I have a Versa. I was getting the O2 readings for each night, which I really liked to see. Then I signed up for premium, hoping to get more out of the watch. In doing so, I lost the O2 readings. I either don't know how to access it or it's not part of Premium. I would like it and the other stats Premium gave. Or give up Premium. Anyone can help me with this?

I have Narval CC from my dentist. I wanted to avoid using the CPAP and the surgery, so I went this route. It took a few trial and error to get the optimal fit. So far so good. Without insurance, it cost $2,500. Lucky for me, it BCBS covered 80%.  I have no problem with TMJ with the mouthguard. It's pretty flexible and I very comfortable. Also I have been forcing myself to sleep on the sides, which my significant other said helps out alot with the mouthguard. Hope this helps.

What do we do with different experiences?  Perhaps there is a spectrum of experiences users have with this model.
@justinfit2020- I’ve not found a way to export the data to a spreadsheet but are you a Premium subscriber? I am and in Premium I can ask for a Wellness Report that presents the data as you want it. I did not want to share my personal report in a public forum so I sent you a screen shot in PM.

We are always told about the golden hour of 8hrs sleep, and certainly, anyone else I know seems to sleep around 7-10 hours, Hell my teenage kids could sleep 12+ hours.  Then there is me 5-6hours sleep. Over the past year I've set about trying to improve this, I've done various things from cutting out caffeine, cold bedrooms, various sleep hygiene tips and tricks, various potions and lotions from Magnesium to chamomile to passionflower to valerian to melatonin. I can safely say nothing has improved my sleep duration. I guess what's more frustrating for me is the fact 6 hours is the maximum and 4 am is the latest waking time. What I mean by this is if I went to bed at 2am I will only sleep 2 hours I will wake at 4am, If I went to bed at 8pm I will wake at 2am. I can function well on 3 hours sleep believe it or not, after an hour or so of tiredness I am fine.   I have come to the conclusion after this year of messing about with sleep that for me at least 6 hours is the maximum I am gonna get, 5 hours is more normal for me.  Perhaps some people just don't need a lot of sleep?
I've had my FitBit Inspire about a week.  The first night I noticed it didn't record the first two hours of my sleep.  Then two nights ago it did the same thing and last night it didn't record any sleep.  I have tried doing a re-start on it.  This is one of the main reasons, besides HR that I purchased it so it is important to me to have a unit that records sleep.  I love all the functions, just need this one function working also.Hope you can help.

Why doesn't Fitbit Luxe update my sleep information anymore? For the first 3 weeks it updated but no longer since.
if you dream you are in Rapid eye movent ...REM.  It is luke a dogs paw when they dream...ugh i think a ft bit that tells you when you are in the deep sleep portion should be left to sleep labs.  Basing this on the fact that my fitbit says I do not sleep but 2 hours a night
Yep, average sleep works for me especially since my Fitbit won't support the sleep score (too old).Get Outlook for Android
I've had problems with sleep ever since my teens (40 now) I can not remember the last time I slept all night. My sleep is light, broken, tossing and turning, waking 3-4 times per night. I be grateful when it gets to a reasonable time where I can just get up. The result of all this is fatigue, lower energy in the gym, lower testosterone etc.I will fall over to sleep quickly the issue is not staying asleep and when I diet it seems to fcuk up even the falling asleep part.I've done all the sleep hygiene tips, dark room, cool room, regular bedtime, bath before bed, salts etc, but all these things focus on mainly falling asleep not staying asleep.Over the years I have tried.[list][*] Herbal tablets[*] Valerian[*] Meditation[*] Medication[*] Magnesium[*] CBD[*][/list]The worst has been been over the counter medication, these leave a horrible hangover but again everything is focused on falling asleep not staying asleep.
Sleep is always credited to the day you wake up.

Dominique | FinlandIonic, Aria, Flyer, TrendWeight | Windows 7, OS X 10.13.5 | Motorola Moto G6 (Android 9), iPad Air (iOS 12.4.4)Take a look at the Fitbit help site for further assistance and information.
I have been working at this for the 2 months that I have had the Force and have asked many people to help.  Some did but it left me still with my original question (and the Dashboard with the same answer).  So I have concluded that the purpose of the Sleep setting is to print out the sentence: "There is already a sleep during the time period you tried to create the new sleep."  It does not matter what I do;  What state my tracked is in;  What times I enter, how sleepy I am, what the weather is, whether I say "same day" or "different day" etc.  The result is always the same.  It prints: "There is already a sleep during the time period you tried to create the new sleep." What people have told me in the past was obtained from the para in the manual that says how to log sleep.  But that will not work if all the logger does is say "There is already a sleep during the time period you tried to create the new sleep."  The only setting that stops it from doing that is if I enter a start time that is later than the stop time:  Then it tells me I made an error.  Otherwise it says, "There is already ...."  If anyone has figured out anything else it does please let me know.
Those flashing lights are on for such a short period, and then it goes dark, so I don't think it should affect the sleep at all. My alarm clock time is also a green color, and gives off way more light than the FitBit does, and is continuous.
Sleep tracking for me stopped March 30, 2023. As you have I've done all of the Fitbit troubleshooting and nothing has worked. Disappointed.
Hello, I don't understand why my heart has disappeared from the sleep score.  It is now just show the sleep zones without the actual heart rate.  Is this an update to the app, if so, I'd rather have the heart rate shown than the zone.  Thanks

I have had my Versa for 2 years, I am experiencing the same sleep score problem, my husband is as well.  It has also been for the last 2 nights.  I am here searching if I am the only person with this issue.  Apparently, I am NOT.  Yes frustrating.  I'm wondering if it something to do with Fitbit proper, maybe they need to update their platform.
On my computer I can see the amount of sleep per day for a week, etc. and off to the right the sleep quality per day vertically.  How can I print out the sleep quality daily graphs for the doctor?  I did it a month ago and now I cannot seem to do it.
Thanks but my friends and I have our privacy setting for sleep set to the friends Icon.We double checked it again and we still cannot see each other's data.  Just does not work for us.  Its a mystery...
@PJs2019 @Mary27  Are you using the new Fitbit dashboard or the old?  If you're on the new dashboard, simply click into the "Discover" tab at the bottom of your app, then click on "Health & Fitness Stats".  From there, you can add the sleep metric back to your dashboard if it was inadvertently removed.     If you're on the old Dashboard with "tiles", check out this post.

I am 80 years old using charge2 Fitbit for about 10 years. Currently I signed into Fibit Premium to get more than just my blood pressure. I do not quit appreciate the scoring as I vary from 55 to 77. I consider a rem/deep of 20/25 and a restoration of 20/25 good but I am not sure. And at various times I get no reading because my fitbit does not get a full 3 hour read. And when I get readings with two time segments there a clear time gap of one to two hours that I call my G rating.just to make things interesting I am also trying to correlate the above fitbit readings to my C-pap.Anyone out there my age care to post their experience ?
I have Charge 2 plus insomnia too! It's a little bit nebulous, but "restless" means there's some movement, like tossing and turning, but less movement than getting up. How it determines what 'restless' and 'awake' are is somewhat of a mystery. I find that even if I'm awake in bed, if I don't move at all, it won't register as restless unless I move a bit. You may be interested to know that soon there will be an update for the Charge 2 that will increase it's sleep tracking capability, including identifying REM and deep sleep patterns.

andrew.a .  I even went out and bought a Blaze so i can see the more detailed sleep patterns. And like you said over the last couple days I only see the old school sleep graph. Wonder what happened ??  If you find anything out can you pass it my way ?
Same, in the dashboard it shows my sleep, but when you click on it, I get the "see sleep score with premium" and no sleep for last night. Between this and fighting to sync every day, I have had enough.
I would like to see the return of the sleep efficiency percentage on the website.  It is immensely helpful and was easy to see the restless, asleep and awake times during sleep.  The new version is less easy to read and the elimination of the sleep efficiency percentage is a great loss.  Please put the sleep efficiency back! mary anne
Hello! I have five dogs, four of which sleep with me, and they do not affect my sleep tracking (FitBit Sense). I've been out like a light a few times last week, and none of their movements interrupted my tracking.

My sleep score and heart rate are gone. I am retired I don't have money for premium.I cannot afford the features that I have been using for the past five years. I cannot use any of the premium health stuff. my age prevents me from most of premium features.this maybe the last Fitbit product that I will purchase.
I am confused. How do we know what setting we shud put between Normal and Sensitive for sleep on my Flex 2
I track my sleep each night with my Versa, and I noticed that when my battery level is very low (10%) (Forgotten to charge by the time bedtime arrives) I receive low levels of Rem and or Deep sleep. I wanted to find out if this was perhaps due to the Fitbit resorting to Normal sleep tracking and not sensitive, when the battery level is low? Unless it is just pure coincidence!
I struggle to burn calories at my nightshift job and find if I increase my activity after work , I can't get enough sleep.

Thanks guys for posting these pictures. My sleep graph often looks similar to what BrianUK posted, and I had wondered whether it was actually normal.  @WavyDavey as I mentioned in this thread, Fitbit sleeps to detect awakenings of 30 seconds or greater, but I believe the source for that article in which Fitbit mentioned awakenings actually deals with awakenings of an even shorter duration.
After syncing my Fitbit Versa I went in to look at last nights data, and found a big conflict in last nights data. Today is showing 3hrs 43mins sleep where the graph above shows I have more than hit my target of 7hrs sleep.  When I go in to the graph it has me down as sleeping 11hrs 29mins.   How do I sort out this huge conflict in time?  I have tried altering the sleep log which used to work with my blaze when it had conflicts in time data but it’s not worked with my Versa. I also restarted my Versa and re-synced it.  I have my sleep settings at sensitive and I use the iOS app.
@Runner0621 it's only on my dominant wrist at night, when I'm asleep. I haven't found that out makes a difference whether it is set to dominant or nondominant at night, so I don't bother changing it.

Not yet.1. When the watch light turns on in the middle of the night and wakes you up that's a hindrance. NEEDS a light turn off feature, even LOW LIGHT wakes me up.2. Last night FEB 23, I notified that I was going to sleep...there was no record this morning was the first time this has happened..3. Other nights - I felt like I had a great night sleep...but showed I was awake and I know the notice says...YOU may not know you are awake, so if it just measures you tossing or turning even though you are asleep and then the watch light comes on...they need to revisit the watches functions. Other than that...really like the FITBIT
The sleep tracker has also stopped working properly on my One.  It collects the time that the timer was running, and identifies the periods of restlessness with the number of times it thinks I was awakened, but it also shows 0 min to fall asleep, 100% sleep efficiency, etc.  This bug is about 10 days old, and appears to be caused by some Fitbit server-side update around September 1, 2014.
You can set alarms based on time, but not on a sleep event. I'm not sure about the API route, but there's a dedicated API forum here that you'd probably want to ask there. Is there anything else besides sleep that you want from a fitbit? Heart rate tracking is popular, and comparing the heart rate graph to the sleep chart sometimes yields interesting information. In that case, I'd probably go with the Alta HR.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
I would say you're set on sensitive instead of normal.  It looks like it's picking up every movement you make and not giving you enough sleep time.  Be sure it's on normal.  For myself, the reason I asked about the number of restless movement of others is because one doctor says I'm not bad enough to be treated for sleep apnea and another says I need to be treated.  Too much movement isn't good if it's caused by sleep apnea. I was looking to see what other people are doing as far as restlessness.Thanks everyone for your response!
I suspect that you're a restless sleeper. Perhaps you were tossing and turning, or actively dreaming. Do you see this often?
Greetings all, I've had my Fitbit Inspire HR since July of this year, and I wanted to share with you how I benefit from its data. I'm 55 YO, a daily cyclist, 188cm and about 102kg. After a high blood pressure reading earlier in the year, I purchased a BP monitor as well. After about two months' logging on a Google spreadsheet, I saw patterns that have compelled me to change my habits. I found applying conditional formatting to the columns to highlight good and bad figures was more effective than charts. After some time, I rearranged the columns to demonstrate cause and effect. In my case, I noticed good outcomes began with exercise, so I moved that column left. The following day or days, my sleep improves, so I moved that column to be next. My resting heart rate and blood pressure improve together after that. (Conversely, I noticed weeks ago how even moderate alcohol consumption raised my RHR, which then damaged my sleep and blood pressure.) I've drawn the relationship between these columns in black outlines on the attached image. The first consequence of studying this data has been to (mostly) cut out booze. The second will be to make more strenuous exercise a daily habit. I now regard my overweight as the result of years of mindless (moderate) drinking and insufficiently strenuous exercise, and am using the data to steer myself back to better health.
I have exactly the same issue and can’t find much information on why this is or how to change it.
i have no idea how to post a screenshot but theother night i went to beed close to 1am and wokeup after 9am. the tracker said i went to sleep @ 5am and fell asleep right away. gorwing frustrated.
I’m only getting basic sleep stages with my Fitbit Versa, I’ve had full sleep stage data with how I wear it, so I know it’s not the fit. I’ve checked for an update, and I’m not seeing one. I got my Versa for Christmas and I’ve been seeing full sleep stages since I’ve been wearing it, but the last 2 nights just basic stages. Is anyone else having this problem? Mine started on the nights 1/11/19 and 1/12/19.
Recently, My Versa doesn't start my sleep time accurately. I.E. I went to bet at 11:00 PM on Friday night and my fitbit says my sleep did not start until 3 AM. I know I did not lay there for 3 hours, I don't remember lying awake for very long at all. This has happened 2 or 3 times in the past week.

If I have trouble sleeping personally I just take naps later in the day which isn't a big deal for me.My husband though he always drinks one of these when he gets insomnia and hes out within the hour after taking it.

I just got my fitbit flex for my birthday this weekend and started using it on Monday.  I put it in sleep mode last night but was bummed to find this morning there was no sleep log.  I manually entered my hours on the mobile app and it populated my sleep pattern for the night.  That makes sense since I'm sure there are nights we all forget.  So that is always an option!
I consider the weekly average sleep count one of the most useful and important features. Its replacement with the worthless and ridiculous sleep score, with not even an option to revert to the weekly average, is a sign of Fitbit deciding things in a vacuum without showing any consideration and empathy for customers' opinions. Remember, Fitbit, market leadership comes and goes; users vote with their wallets. There's an increasing number of competitors in this space, and all of a sudden I went from a loyal Fitbit enthusiast to someone proactively exploring other alternatives. It's not just about the stupid sleep score; it's about the contempt and arrogance you show in making choices for me.
FitBit says:Most people go to bed between 10:20 -11.Most people fall asleep within 8 - 11 minutes.Median times awake was 8 - 11 times.Median time in bed was 7.5 - 8 hours.Median actual time asleep 7 - 7.5 hours.This was among FB users.
Everyone is different. I have mine set to sensitive and non-dominant hand, but may consider changing it to normal. My sleep varies, but I move around at night, adjusting my blanket, checking the clock, turning on the radio, etc and it all adds up to restlessness or being awake, so that is why my percentage can be lower. Read this article on how sleep is tracked. It might help you understand it a bit more.  click You shouldn't worry about it, but consider it part of learning your sleep habits. It's always a shock to see just how many times you're awake or restless.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
Our home renovation is almost over and, we are waiting for the last couple of bits to be to be added to the home. As for our mattress, what we're using was too old. We are planning to replace it with a new one. I was particularly looking for some kind of sale or replacement offer from the shop. The amount of budget on the mattress was comparatively low, so I have to be minimal in selection. As I have registered with a couple of sites recently, I got a notification from this online mattress store, where they will be having sales on weekends. So I was going through the site on weekend I was really impressed with deals they had, for me it's like an entire shopping is done within one place. As I am doing the online mattress-https://mattressville.ca/ shopping for the first time, I want to know about the things that I should be aware of?
Has nothing to do with paying for it.  Some nights you just don't happen to get a score for whatever a reason, maybe watch slipped on wrist so didn't get consistent readings, or who knows why, but it has nothing to do with some big conspiracy theory.  It might be back tomorrow, with no relation to whether or not you make a payment.So really no need to sleep with that tin foil hat on.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I *think* I might have solved the riddle of how to get more deep sleep.  I have noticed that the more strenuous physical activity that I get, the more deep sleep that I get.  One day I did a lot of gardening and that night I got almost an hour of deep sleep. It didn't register as "steps" because I was doing more bending than anything, but I did not meet the 10K step requirement. If I had, I might have been able to get more deep sleep. A couple of days ago, I got in my 10K steps and that night I got 1 hour and 9 minutes of deep sleep, which is the highest I have ever got since using my Fitbit Charge 2 (just got it about 3 weeks ago).  So, I think that if we are able to get enough physical activity in AND get at least 10K steps in a day, we should be able to get more deep sleep. I'm starting to think that since we, as a society, move less than generations before us, that we are not getting enough deep sleep. Most of us have jobs where we are at the computer almost all day long (I'm one of them) and we do not get enough physical movement. It's VERY hard for me to get in 10K steps in a day. But if you read the community board about how to sneak in extra steps, it really does work (e.g. parking your car further away, taking stairs instead of elevator, etc.).  Just thought I'd share my findings so far.
@EdsonFitbit This topic is tricky for me, I've slept 10 hrs on my day off 🙂 but sometimes the more I sleep the more tired I get out of bed hahaha and on the other hand taking a 10 - 15 minutes nap will feel great! I think that more than the lenght of your sleep we should focus in the quality of our sleep time, just my opinion 🙂

I do grind my teeth I am aware of that. I am researching sleep apnea and I think I may have the EDS type, excessive daytime sleepiness. The rest of the symptoms except irritability dont apply to me. I think EDS because I have the hardest time waking up in the mornings and I never really understood why. Especially I don't sleep much I thought it would be easier to wake up... I think we maybe on to something....
Mine was 95 % but I'm a restless sleeper
@ScottAG unfortunately not. If you're awake more than an hour and then go back to sleep, your sleep will be split into two sessions. I don't think there's a way to change that. Sorry...

Started really working on #100 days of walking at the start of this week, using fitbit to help me stick to it. Muscles are now so sore that I'm waking up more, not less, and sleeping half an hour less, despite exhaustion. But brain is functioning better and I'm hoping that a week from now I'll be a lot less sore and the sleep benefits will kick in. The extra 5k a day on my average can't be doing any harm
I recently learned of a link between adrenal gland functions and your sleep pattern issues.  At around 3 to 330am your adrenal gland should shut down so that you can fall into a deeper sleep.  If your adrenal gland is misfiring it will wake you up. I have been working with a homeopathic office in my area with great success.  If you allow the adrenal issue to continue you will eventually feel exhaustion daily.  Stress was a huge contributor to my adrenal issue. Sorry to say the worst thing you could do is follow you MD's advice.  Get off the sleep aids and get to the root of the problem good luck..also my MD was not helping me or several of my friends who also have been under stress.. I guess welcome to mulitasking go go go 2014
@janetb21 this is an issue with the Fitbit Android app. It is happening to a lot of us right now. There's a discussion about it here and you may want to watch that thread for updates.

My question is this if each yellow spike potentially represents a breathing issue ….wouldn’t you have to have over 4 to be diagnosed with sleep apnea?  My sleep doctor says 4 or less apneas a night is normal.
How do you see your sleep profile?
I see that Fitbit has a Premium membership for $50/yr that includes reports of the type you are looking for.  Looks like you can try it for 7 days for free. I also Googled "sleep diary template" and came up with lots of results that are probably free.
Hi @SunsetRunner -- The issues I've had with sleep are much less challenging than yours, so I'm somewhat reticent to offer suggestions.  However, the following practice really made a difference to me:  I read fiction from a paper book (not Kindle or anything electronic) until I get sleepy.  Non-fiction is to be avoided because of our tendency to try to incorporate it into our current personal situations.  I believe this suggestion is made by Tim Ferris in The 4-hour Workweek.  The effect is to clear and calm the mind leading to more restful sleep, which it does for me.

Great! 😞 Thanks for the info xSent from my iPhone
But - but - but - How do you actually rule out a sleep disorder? I've got a sleep log that has always looked like that on the sensitive setting. It's probably not a sleep disorder, but I'm wondering what happens when people go to a sleep doctor with a log like that. What are the types of movement in normal sleep that log as restless on the sensitive setting? How do you know if your log is "accurate" - if you knew whether it was accurate or not, you wouldn't need the Fitbit to track your sleep. (In the meantime I'll go back to the normal setting. )
Amazing the pics and the article.
Have you figured out how to do it yet? Mines the same it seems to be since I updated it afew weeks ago 😒
I have the same issue. I used to think I wasn't getting enough sleep, but I see from tracking that I AM getting sleep - just below the normal range for deep sleep. Therefore, I don't feel rested even if I meet my sleep goal. And I agree, I bet it is the vigilance that's keeping you from resting, at least partially. Although even before I had kids, I was always a super light sleeper and woke very easily, from childhood. Any suggestions on how to get more deep sleep, anyone?
There was such a headband-based system the Zeo available several years ago, that was tied into a smart alarm clock, waking you by sleep stages.  Unfortunately it suddenly disappeared several years ago.  I used it some but keeping the headband tight enough but comfortable was an issue, as was the price of headstrap replacements. You say your REM and light sleep were right on with sleep study.  I wonder how much the deep was off by, and was it that deep and wake times were confused if REM and light were good?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I have the same issue, and it only started about 2 or 3 weeks ago - for the past year it has always shown my sleep result during the entire night, including getting up to go to the bathroom !!!!Can I not reset or at least change the date ???'
Are you sure that it is correct, and if so, have you talked to a doctor about this? Bradycardia is something you should check out. I had a RHR that low, and the GP changed my medication.  My Fitbit Charge 2 has a fault where every now and again it tells me my heart rate went up to around 185 for a while. I'm severely disabled and mostly bedbound, so I'm not exercising, and I'm not having regular heart attacks. It's just a Fitbit fault. I use the exercise tracker to show my detailed heart rate for those minutes, then I can subtract the incorrect ones from my actual number of minutes in my peak heart rate zone that day, which I track for health reasons.
To add more info I am feeling normal after waking up. I work with full of energy and I don't feel like I am having memory problems or anything.
Sleep mode accidentally deleted, how do I replace sleep mode .
Hi everyone! I have pretty erratic sleep patterns right now. I run my own business form home so sometime will crash at say 9pm, then wake up around midnight and start working again, then crash later once I finish etc. Sometimes my fitbit Charge 2 thinks I've gone back to sleep even after I've been awake for a while. My resting heart rate can get low and while working at my computer I'm conceivably not moving very much so it could think I haven't been moving much and am just "restless" in my sleep cycle. However is there a way to manually tell it that I'm awake so this doesn't happen? Thx!

But a dysfunctional neurotransmitter in this case GABA is not a mentalillness. It's a problem with how your body transmits signals.For instance I have a condition in which I can lie in bed, be wide awakebut have no motor skills, it's called hypnogogic or something like that,just like I can drive while asleep, my mental ability is just fine,although I feel tired; the problem is turns, stops, things which requireyour body to be completely awake.As far as provigil and nuvigil are concerned, when NORD was paying for mydrugs I was getting 800 mg of provigil per day, 200 mg of nuvigil and I wasfine but always felt like someone was lifting my eyelids, in other wordsnever really rested.To make matters worst, I had a deviated septum. Bruxism and restless legsyndrome as well, because of being bipolar , lithium was prescribed and Igained weight like crazy, from 218 to 318# and that acerbated my breathing.Event hough I was prescribed at the time a cpap machine it hurt my head andwas so noisy, I didn't use it. I didn't care if I looked like an alien orJason in Friday 13th. But that noise, I couldn't tolerate.I don't understand AD except I know I started on Ritalin and for kids withit. It slows them down but for an adult,Ritalin speeds you up(keeps youawake).Of course, for me it was a curse because I had bipolar disorder andmy moods would be mercurial.So if you mean mental disorders, like bipolar who knows? But I honestlydon't think many narcoleptic with cataplexy are bipolar and if they arethen it becomes very difficult to identify.Whereas Although all cataplectics have narcolepsy, the opposite is nottrue, most narcoleptic do not have cataplexia which is easy to identifysince it's identifier resides in a patient's spinal fluid.Narcolepsy is diagnosed when in a sleep clinic in a series of 5 fifteenminutes naps, you go into REM sleep.I never had to take more than two naps, I go into REM sleep almostimmediately,It's hard to compare anything to narcolepsy and conjecture without reliabledata, Thankfully I am in the care of one of the country's leading PulmonarySpecialists, Dr. Frank Hull who is an expert in sleep related medicalissues. And he is constantly updating me and keeping me informed on ongoingresearch and advances in medicine related to narcolepsy.But the question of whether it gets easier or harder can't be answered by a20 year old, experience and learning to listen to your body and becomingflexible will lead to an acceptable middle road. The only thing that willchange it is a major break through and I don't see it happening. THERE ISTOO MUCH MONEYBAND PROFIT SELLING THE DRUGS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO LIVE OURLIVES BEST AS POSSIBLE.I have often wondered what it would be like to wake up in the morning orwhenever and feel fully rested?People who have disabilities don't overcome them.But by listening to theirbody. Listening to your doctor. Understanding what it is you can do andwhat you can't, coming to an acceptance, you learn to quit feeling sorryfor yourself, count your blessings and then you are living with adisability.Isn't it like sometimes you feel terrible but not sick enough to skip work.You go anyway because you have to without too much thought,And it's tough. But when you get your paycheck you forget all about that,We weren't promised a perfect life, so we have to make due and acceptancebegins the end to that suffering accepting there's not anything you can dobut move forward. Live your life and just be glad that you are alive.
I have somewhat of the same issue.  I have the Fitbit set to "normal" sensitivity.  I don't know how much "restless" times is normal.  I am awake on average 3 times but I am restless for between 16 and 22 times a night.  I take Ambian and still have a hard time falling asleep. FitBit registers me as asleep when I'm sitting in bed playing on my phone but I can take that into account.  What I can't explain is being restless that many times a night.  What is normal?

Hello @olledejong and welcome to the Help forums.  The thread you reference is a very old thread.  Fitbit replaced Sleep Efficiency with the Sleep Score for heart rate trackers. Here is Fitbit's current Help article that explains Sleep Score.   The Help article that is linked in you post was removed. What model Fitbit do you use?  It might help answer your question.

Wow! Thanks for such a detailed explanation! I’ll have to take a deep dive into the data that I’ve collected.
Waking up does not correlate to any cause. I just wake up. Wish I knew why. The worse part is getting back to sleep.
Hey ,  Thanks , for the insight.Davey
Here is something that has helped me drastically.... Magnesium Citrate... It helps relax you and improve your sleep because it relaxes you. Another thing you might try is hypnosis by Steve G. Jones. You listen to it while you sleep, on repeat if necessary but one of the things it does is suggest a deep peaceful sleep at the end of the tract. He isn't a quack either. He has hundreds of topics to choose from but all of them that I have selected have helped. I have severe chronic pain so sleeping isn't the most comfortable for me either. I have found that not eating carbs within 4 hours of bedtime helps too because I used to wake up within a couple of hours because my blood sugars were falling and I was hungry... So high protein and fats and low carbs in the evening helped that as well... Just some suggestions that worked for me... Hope something helps y'all.
If you suspect you have a "sleep disorder" your doctor can refer you to do a sleep study. This requires at least one over night stay in which they hook you up to several electrodes and they determine if you are having apneas, (breathing lapses) and to what extent, if any. This is pretty conclusive and they will prescribe a cpap machine or some variant which will stop the apneas. They use the numbers gleened from the sleep study to input a certain pressure setting so that you are getting the right level of air to stop the apneas. Hope this helps and hope you are well. 🙂
That is because the alcohol breaks down into sugar in your body disrupting your sleep. I see the same patterns.

Hi all, I'm a Fitbit Flex user (one month thus far).  My sleep pattern is horrible.  During an EMG this past spring, the technician told me something is waking me up but wouldn't give any specifics.  Any ideas what could be waking me up?  I take several medications at night, one specifically to put me to sleep.     Any ideas?
I get what you're saying. Honestly, the only reason I wear it at night is so I won't forget to put it on in the morning.  Some people have pretty lousy sleep. The sleep monitoring can help them see if there's something they need to address. I have actually read that it helped someome have some disorder diagnosed, but I can't remember the details. If you don't like wearing it when you sleep - take it off. It's not like seeing the results of 14 restless moments the next day will help you get fewer restless moments the next time you go to sleep.

I tried making up for lost sleep by taking a 2 hour nap in the afternoon. But I didn't find the results satisfying. You can't really get much deep sleep in during a nap. What worked better for me, is when I get up in the middle of the night, to get out of bed, and do something light. Usually within about an hour, I'll start to feel a little sleepy and can often go back asleep.

Thanks MarciM,How do I set my sleep time after the fact?Sent from my iPad
Cemese, this happened to me as well. Not well explained and dissappointing. I'd like to know how to get it back as well but I suspect we may simply need to move on. . .
Not sure why it marked it as a solution. Glad it’s not just me. I wondered the same - am I dead? Did I dream I was sleeping while awake. This is very upsetting and wrong. Hopefully it will be fixed
I currently have two usable FitBits: a Charge HR and a Blaze. I have found the Charge HR to be more comfortable than the Blaze, especially for sleeping. It turns out that the Charge HR does not give a sleep score like the Blaze does. Also, it gives a simple column chart of my night, as opposed to the much fancier analysis chart and sleep score that I get with the Blaze. Not for nothing, but it is also of interest that the Blaze thinks I get a lot more sleep ("Sleep Scores" around 80), whereas the Charge HR seems to think I only manage a little over 4 hours per night. Which is closer to correct? Can you tell me where there would be such a disparity between the two devices? Does the Blaze have more sensors? Also, which FitBits give the "full report" and which are limited like the Charge HR? Maybe there is a newer FitBit that has the comfort of the Charge HR, but provides the better sleep analysis of the Blaze? Thanks.
I can't find SLEEP. Is it on the dashboard? I don't need to log in on home ctr.

I hope a moderator will delete this--I would have done that myself but I don't seem to have that ability available to me. Anyhow...  The issue is solved.  Wrote down all of the sleep wake times, deleted a bunch of sleep records, signed out of the app, turned off bluetooth, and then used the online dashboard to add records back in.  One record is messed up, as in it did not give me sleep zone data and also said I was asleep during some time frames when I was awake and even out of the bed walking around.  I took that one back out and split it into two separate records (with a 30 minute gap for the one time frame where I knew for certain I was awake).  I think that's good enough.  I have the impression that up until now (greater than six months of logs) those longer periods of awake time have shown up fairly accurately regardless of whether the data were good enough to show sleep stages, so I hope that is not a new thing that is going to be happening more often.  Maybe this will help someone else.
So I have now had my blaze on for 5 nights and for fun my partner wore it for 1. I'm having 30-55 waking periods a night, he had 15 (and commented that he felt like he kept waking up and couldn't sleep). Im a person who only snores very very lightly, has sinus issues, severe headaches (daily without medication), and very low energy levels (I need minimum 9 hours sleep a night and still get very tired). How does this compare and thoughts?
I put it on my wrist loosely. I move at night and it cutting the blood flowto my hand.
Hi there. We’re you ever able to resolve your sleep issue. I experienced similar. It’s such a harsh experience to have. Tash
Thank you for your help.  But something else is wrong.  I only saw the graph with the hours sleeping, times awake one time.  Since you provided the picture of what I should see, when I click log, then sleep it  just gives me a place to enter the time I went to sleep & the time I got up.  There is no graph!  There are no records at all & i have done this 2 nights.  I will call the company today.  Thank you anyway.
I'm not a medical expert, but I can't imagine any way a CPAP would hurt your lung capacity.  If anything, it should increase you overall health.  It could be that it is just taking you a while to adjust to it and, if you just started, you could even be getting poorer sleep for a bit until you get used to sleeping with it.  Stick with it and I expect you will soon notice improvement.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Thank you that clears things up
It happens from time to time after a sinc in the mornings, that the sleep stage info given is the old info and not the new with REM, light and deep sleep. Why is that?
I used to get this, the old 11:30pm congrats. I just disable notifications near bedtime and re-enable them in the morning.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Yes and I wasn't even tired. Not one bit. So, I was just wondering if something like that can be possible? Oh and since I had first posted this I have had pretty normal and good sleep since. See I just no my lack of sleep wasn't from sugar or caffeine or even the hot cocoa I enjoy so much. For one I hadn't had hot Cocoa in three days at that time (The weather was fairly decent.) and I cut the sugar stuff way back and I don't have anything with caffeine in it past 6 pm.
Thank you for your reply.  I guess I mispoke in saying "That way you do not have to remember to turn it on and off each day."  I have the Sense but my previous smartwatch would automatically block notifications when I was sleeping.  What I'm suggesting is that if I took a nap midafternoon it would sense I was sleeping and text messages and calls would not ring through and the same feature with bedtime whenever that may be.   Not everyone has a regular sleep schedule to be able to set specific hours each day or week.  I'm not saying eliminate the sleep schedule option but to have a second option where it automatically senses you are sleeping to stop notifications from coming through.
That makes sense! Thanks!
I've been getting this about once or twice a week since I got my Ionic. Never had it with the Charge 2.

when I put down my sleep on the dashboard I get one value and when I download the sleep on the export I get an entirely lower value.  I have The Fitbit HR,    The only difference I can see is that ther are gaps between the sleep nodules  which the dashboard pickup up as sleep but the downloads only picks up some of it.   I was sick for 3 days where 1 sleep between 11 to 19 hours on the dashboard but the log only showed a max of 6 hrours on those days.  For my wife you log only shows 3 - 4 hrs of sleep  when she actually sleeps 6 - 8   she gets up during the night to take the dogs out and I think that time is what is interfering with your log.  as far as I can see the sleep stats are lacking and do not goo.  I love the other parts of the log
I can't answer your questions but thought you might be interested in fitbit's explanation for their use of sleep stages at https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163/
@dia @SolangeE I agree with both of you too! Technology sometimes gets the best of me at night, but I find that I sleep much better when I shut the laptop early and instead journal for half an hour before bed! Zzzzz....  (:

I also got the simplified/classic sleep display. This is the first time it's happened - hoping it's a system problem that will be resolved!
From my personal experience, this is how I regulate my sleep -  Cease all sound and visual stimulation i.e. television, stereo sound in the hour prior to sleep.Reading or Writing for 15 minutes prior to sleep.Establishing a prioritized time to get into bed for sleep (easier expressed than done of course)What I struggle with still at times is my inability to prioritize a sleeping schedule as I would eating or training schedule.  With a 93% sleep efficiency I have room to improve.  My Flex device seems to be accurately measuring my sleeping patters as of now.  It is one (Sleep Feature) of my favorite features of Fitbit Flex. - Michael Dadourian michaeldadourian.comTo watch "The DKMD Show" on YouTube

I have been using my Charge2 off and on for 2-3 years primarily for sleep tracking.  I stop using it when I get frustrated with the results.... then end up trying again down the road hoping maybe the software has changed or I can figure a way for it to work for my situation.  If it matters, I am in the first month of a 90 day Premium trial.
 
The main issue is that I sleep 2-3 times during a 24 hour period starting anywhere from 3pm to 4 am. The software will combine sleep periods sometimes but I don't see any pattern. Sometimes it does...some times it doesn't.
 
From browsing the sleep topics it seems that there is a way to make manual adjustments but before I start doing that every day I'd like to understand how the software works in hopes that I don't have to every day.
 
Should I set my Go To Bed and Wake Up times in a certain way?  Any other suggestions?

When I don't get enough sleep I want to eat. I was hungry last night at around 10 p.m. So I ate some whole grain cheerios before I went to bed. I had to get up to use the bathroom a couple of times and my sleep got interupted leaving me tired when I got up. Now all I want to do is eat. So to help with the cravings I binge on sugar free gum. This is my habit. I haven't done it yet today.  HELP!
Hello @Nomes! It helps a lot to realize small things that you do automatic, or without giving it a good thought during a normal day, we are constantly making decisions that impact in the world in different ways that we don't even notice some times. Specially all the good things we have, and I'm not talking about the material stuff, we give for granted a lot of things, so as you write in your journal you get to feel that gratitude towards life. I think everyone should try to have one, it has helped me a lot too! 
 
Hey and have you checked some natural alternatives instead of Seroquel, you can check them out and maybe discuss with your doctor, seems a good option. 
 
It is a really good habbit, drawing and just putting in paper whatever is on your mind, specially if you are doing it outdoors looking at a landscape. 🙂 @LadyWeasel Something that has helped me a lot to calm down and feel better is drawing mandalas, check the psychological good effects that it brings.
 
 Regarding the Journal feature please post the idea in the feature request board so that our web engineers can take it in consideration for future changes. 
 
Hope this helps and thanks for being part of the Family!

...would wake. Essentionally, I spent about ten years never actually sleeping well. She put me on Ambien, and now I sleep wonderfully. Only gotta be SURE I'm not perusing Amazon or eBay, after taking the Ambien, or I'll forget I'd purchased a few items, until thay arrive on my doorstep! Entertaining, depending on what I unknowingly purchased. 🙂
Suggest removing all 'white light' from your bedroom - digital clock, etc.  Use bed only for sleeping and not for TV.  Also - try and routinely go to bed and get up at the same time if possible.
I am 130 lbs and exercise 4-5 times a week. It is NOT being sedentary that’s causing this. given the amount of health data you guys collect it’s about time you returned the favour and gave us some answers about this!My multiple fitbits have shown this happens to me EVERY night and has done for years. No doctor seems to think it’s an issue, but rubbish sleep that’s ineffective IS obviously an issue…can you shed any further light on this?
I almost never remember my dreams, do I actually dream?  I do and I remember waking up tired and effected by a dream, just almost never remember the dream.   At a point, I was concerned and have put a pad next to the bed to capture the dreams.   As I get older, I am less concerned.  I have never sought any professional assistance and have only mentioned it here.  Oh well...

Welcome to the Forums, @Karie1965.
 
Thanks for taking a break from stepping and for sharing the issue you're having with your Fitbit. This is not a normal behavior of any Fitbit device, as you already troubleshoot this with one representative it's best to contact them back and explained those steps didn't work. Our support team will be happy to keep assisting you.
 
Looking forward to see you again in the near future.

My oxygen levels were not showing up, but I read some previous posts and deleted and updated the fitbit app on my phone, now working properly..
My Fitbit doesn’t show any sleep score at all this AM! what’s up???
I don't have quite a full 30 days of HR data. I will email to you in a couple weeks. I do know where to download the CSV file. 🙂
For the past week, although my hours of sleep is recorded, a sleep score is not supplied.  In addition, my readiness score for each day is not available as it tells me to wear my device - and yet it is able to detect my steps etc each day.  These both stopped on the same day,  As far as I can tell (I am still learning how to use my pixel watch) these two measurements are the only two that will not record.  I have looked through the help pages and forum posts but nothing matches my issue and so I am hoping someone can help me please.
Its a cruel irony, but often times worrying about getting enough sleep can lead to insomnia. I know that was a factor I faced when I first started tracking my sleep, and saw the cold hard numbers of how little shut-eye I was getting. I know it can be hard to do, but getting into bed actively thinking about your sleep cycle is the last thing you should be doing. As far as improving the quality and quantity of your sleep, I'd start with a general Sleep Hygiene Checklist: Make sure your bed; your bedding; and bedroom are up to snuff. Clean, fresh, good quality sheets and bedding; a comfortable, supportive mattress; and a bedroom that is comfortable, quiet, private, and dark makes a huge difference. Avoid alcohol; caffeine; nicotine; strenuous exercise, and heavy meals close to bed time. Narcotic and other sleep aids are -at best - a short-term fix. Mentally, you may want to avoid non-fiction; or entertainment that is violent. Don't do school or other work in the couple of hours before bed-time. Stay off the computer for at least an hour before turning in. Try and set a regular, comfortable bed-time - and do your best to keep to it. Set yourself a pre-retirement routine: wash face; brush teeth; etc. Do your best to put nagging day-time worries out of your mind as you get into bed. Deal with solvable problems during the day time. Problems that aren't solvable - its best to think about something else when trying to sleep. Try and get at least an hour or so of moderate exercise during the day. Busy people may want an early-morning workout; or around 5-6 PM.  And ideally finish eating your evening meal at least two hours before retiring. Many people find a warm bath or shower before bedtime helps relaxation.  You may also find it helpful to read or watch something "comforting" to help clear your mind before sleep. A book you've read before, for instance. With luck; after five to ten minutes of lying in your comfortable bed, you'll feel your eyelids getting heavy. Put your book on the nightstand, turn out the light, and let sleep overcome you. Best of luck with this. I know - from my own experience - how frustrating and upsetting persistent insomnia can be. But "rest" assured, if you take some positive steps, you can definitely improve your sleep/
@MariaScott Sorry to hear that!
 
Is your device going into sleep/activity mode during the day, unintentionally? If so, please try giving it a reboot. That should get it up and running again!

Emerson | Community Moderator - English/EspañolI run all over SF. What's your story?
Does anyone know why the Sleep tracking button disappeared from my Luxe Fitbit options? When I go to Activity&Welness under Settings, there is not even an option to add Sleep logs..
That chart looks like the old style sleep tracking. If so, it's not really showing the deep sleep stage. Deep sleep is usually an hour, maybe up to two hours per night.  If you check the Deep Sleep chat thread, a lot of people are getting under an hour or even a half hour per night. Is it showing deep sleep, REM, light sleep and awake time? Can you post a screenshot of an individual night? And what model of Fitbit are you using?

Hi Allie i got into the forums via a google search about the sleep thing. I am always tired I have to admit and quite stressed so maybe that explains it. Sleep is my natural reaction to stress I think to block it out!!
Hello @UKTom, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for the information! 
 
Note that when your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep. Your time asleep is calculated by subtracting your time spent awake and restless from your overall tracked sleep time. For example, if you slept 8 hours but woke up 2 times for 15 minutes each, your time asleep would be 7 hr 30 min.
 
For more information, please check: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
I also suggest you to visit the following link and blog to get a better quality of your sleep. 
 
Hope this helps!

Heyy, new user here! I got a FitBit Charge 3 for Xmas (woo!) and could use some help in getting the sleep score to show. I've logged 5 days of sleep, of which only 2 days show a sleep score. The other 3 days show a sleep pattern. The device is brand new, so I think I'm probably doing something wrong... For all 5 days I have done the following steps: Before I go to sleep I open the app and select begin sleep now with the + symbol. I see a happy moon on the app. Turn the phone screen off and go to sleep. Next morning I click IM AWAKE!! Sometimes I get the score and sometimes I dont..  Both the app and fitbit are up to date. I'm puzzled what I'm doing wrong. Suggestions?

I'm at 14-24x and don't seem to have a noticeable difference withmelatonin, exercise, showers, earplugs, various pillows/mattress changes,etc. Though haven't had the fitbit long enough to test the mattress changesI have been dealing with general tiredness for a long time. I think thefitbit count of restlessness is pretty accurate based on what I rememberwhile sleeping of tossing and turning, and a sleep study I had in 2005where I rose up through the slepe levels to the 'awake' 17 times thoughthey were not long enough to be counted as officially laying there awake,more just that I woke up and turned over. Same study I was at 67% level 2which if I recall was a bit high. Deep sleep and REM I was 'under' by10-20% depending on who you believe for normal. Of course the study wasbizarrely short from my point of view, maybe 7 hours? I think theybasically just wanted to check for restless legs and apnea. Conclusionwas mild fragmentation and suggested I sleep on my side (which I alreadydo) so not very helpful. I am 'asleep' all night and not just layingaround awake but I barely hit 50% so I assume I am just in very light sleeptossing and turning the rest of the time. Recently sent message to mycurrent dr about all this in case they have any reasonable suggestions(though trying to fit all this into their 1000char limit at kaiser was achallenge) I don't generally have a big problem with being tired all thetime as most of the time I can mostly power through, but it does make mydefault behavior trend toward not doing things which is annoying, and theolder I get the harder it is to motivate past it. Nice to have some datato be able to see if changes I make actually do anything though.
You may have a sleep disorder such as narcolepsy. Sleep paralysis is very common in narcolepsy. Talk to your doctor.
I would like to know this as well. It doesn't make any sense. Thank you for the link, I don't think it answers the question. On my sleep log page I have "Time asleep over the past 30 days in hours" and "Total time asleep over the past 30 days in hours." Both of which show the exact same values. I also have "Times awoken over the past 30 days" and "Total times awoken over the past 30 days." Which also show the exact same values.
If anyone knows the answer, please let us know. Like a "merge sleep" option, or something. Or go very "insensitive", or like count sleep within a certain block of time as one.
I accidentally deleted my sleep tracking system. Can anyone help me with how to recover my sleep app?

Oh gosh, my sleep pattern is like that too. I have developed a bad habit now, I am thinking hey since I dont sleep anyway I should just stay up and go ot bed later... Its not like I am getting anymore sleep. Last week one night I slept for 1 hr and 15 minutes out of 5 hours =((
I find the sleep score to be useless and extremely frustrating as an overall metric.My score stays within a 20-point range even when my sleep time varies wildly. It never deviates below ~64, even for nights where I only get ~3 hours of sleep. I know that I do not feel rested when I get up, and I know that I didn't sleep very many hours, but my sleep score still says I got a "fair" night's sleep. Ina  weird way, this makes me feel like my poor-sleep experience is being invalidated, and more importantly that it's a metric, if the scale is so severely weighted that you always stay in a 20 point range.
Clarifying the way that different factors are weighted to create your sleep score would make the sleep score more meaningful. Also, showing a breakdown of scores (or something as simple as a check or minus) for each individual factor that goes into the overall score, might make the sleep score more transparent.

Does the Fitbit One actually track the actual hours that I sleep, if worn on wrist ?
It is so difficult for young adults and teenagers to get adequate sleep. With everything going on in your bodies sleep is often affected by all these hormone changes. I had issues and found I got my best sleep between 5 and 9 am and so did my brothers. My son has the same issue now as a young adult. My only advice is to instil a good bedtime routine. No t.v. Or video games an hour before bed, no studying either. Some light reading, a bath with Epsom salts and lavender or chamomile oils, bedtime tea, relaxation, meditation or any calm activities...colouring is big right now and very relaxing. Wishing you luck on getting some quality sleep.Sent from my iPhone
According to fitbit: "We use the following equation to calculate your sleep efficiency: 100 * time asleep / (time asleep + time restless + time awoken during sleep)" taken from: https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1314/
@cruisegirl60 Yes. I checked with fitbit support. Indeed, they asked me to keep checking, i.e. keep my fitbit app and fitibit device up to date, and then keep checking in the app if there is anything under the Sleep Stages graph. They also cannot give a specified timeline on when this will be rolled out to all users.
I’d like to add two specific tricks I use regarding @WilsonFitbit ‘s suggestions.  Empty the Brain:I use the Fitbit Relax app every night. It centers my breathing and relaxes my whole body. Sometimes I will also meditate. An instructor in a meditation class I took taught us this - do not try to block your thoughts. Just let them pass thru without giving them any attention. For me, this takes much of the stress out of the process. Get out of bed:If I cannot sleep, I get out of bed and play games like Sudoku, Solitaire  or Woody 99 as fast as I can, even if this causes low scores. The faster I play, the better the game forces out all other thoughts. I play until I cannot keep my eyes open.  @cathm ‘s tip -  try to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends - is worth repeating. This will eventually change your rhythms.  @rachelmulraneyy - how are you doing? Have any of these tips helped?
@Twignest  I have the same question and can only say it justifies waking up feeling tired from all that running from monsters I've been doing in my dreams!
Wow... I am very impressed with a 92% score which suggests a more effective day.
Have you ever try to reset your fitbit before went to bed? Just pushed the button until the screen went blank, than wait for 5 or 6 secs until the fitbit symbol on before you released the button.I find Fitbit sleeping analysis is not the great one in term of scoring. I would have much much higher score when the moment I kind of awake, I just make sure fitbit knows I am awake by get up and start moving, compared to when I am laying around on the best. Yes my sleep would end whenever I ended but I got much much higher score despite the fact that I clocked less than minimum sleep hours I set. Just for the shake of conversation I would share something like I got around 90% score for 4 hrs sleeps (the moment I am awake, I get up and move, despite that after a minute or two moving, I went back to bed) compared to 79% for 8 hrs sleep (this because sometimes say on the 4th hrs I was tossing and turning for sometimes and keep trying to fall back to sleep without getting up).
I've noticed the same thing as I regularly attend a HIIT class at our gym. I created an activity under Track Exercise--> Log called HIIT. And I searched on the internet to see what a general HIIT class burns and added that there. So after gym class, I go into Tracking, then log the exercise. The FitBit will add those 'Calories burned' to your 'Calories Burned' for the day.
So, I've started wearing my charge 2 about a month ago, and since I've started my resting heart rate is about 45-48 bpm. It sometimes will even go down to the 30s while I sleep. I'm not athletic at all, the most working out I do is taking my dog for a walk lol. Now for the past few nights, I've received simplified sleep results and it's saying that it's because it can't read my heart rate while I sleep. I've read some other help forums and I seem to be wearing the device properly, as I have been before, and now I'm getting different results. Also, when I check my heart rate graphs there seems to be a few, somewhat short, breaks in the graph. I'm a little concerned lol. Please help
@anniemae  Looking at my Android app, I have a sleep area on the dashboard. If I click on it, it takes me to another screen where I can begin sleep mode or manually log it.

I have a hard time getting to sleep.  I bought the Flex specifically to track this.  But it wasn't. So yesterday, I set it to sensitive, set it in sleep mode, and while I was reading and waiting for sleep to come I flicked my wrist or moved my arm.periodically.  Well, when I logged in my sleep (in bed at 2 am, out of bed at 10:am), it showed the first 90 minutes I was awake.  So while I was in bed for 8 hours, I only slept a max of 6.5.  With the other resless patterns, I got only 5.5 hours of sleep.  This is priceless!  My husband (who falls asleep within 30 seconds of his head hitting the pillow) has been saying I should see a sleep specialist.  With this kind of tracking, I will finally be able to get the help I need.  Also, it explains why I feel like I need a nap on the weekend.  I always feel so guilty-my husband gets up at 6, and I don't get up until 10.  But he got 8.5 hours of sleep, and I only got 5.5. This kind of information is priceless!  My medical insurance is Consumer Directed.  Without this kind of information, it is impossible to make good medical decisions.  Thanks Fitbit!
Sorry, but I also wanted to say that sugary drinks (Coke, Diet Coke) keep me awake too.  I am super caffeine sensitive.
Hey everyone, You can still check this information within the Fitbit app. If you go to the sleep tile, the first thing you see is the weekly bar-graph with the sleep score.  Just swipe to the left until you see the hours asleep graph, which has a bar-graph with the time asleep every day.  If you want to see the average sleep for each week, there's an even better option now. Just keep swiping to the left until you see the "Hours in Sleep Stages" graph, and then tap on the upper right corner to expand it.   There, you can see the average sleep time per week and month, with the advantage that you can adjust this interval by simply sliding the graph left and right (you are not restricted to, let's say, Sep 2 - Sep 8). Hope this is useful!

I thought the HR would of knew your awake from your heart rate reading. Generally when your asleep your heart rate is lower than your resting awake state.

Hi yes these r all on
that being said im not sure if it safe or not to take long term but so far I have asked many people in the medical field and they seem to say that it should not be harmful to most people taking longterm as it is kinda of like a vitamin or something similar that your body produces and uses, I guess thats what I seemed to figure out atleast for my knowledge and self research.
Hi, this is my first ever post, so apologies in advance if this topic has already been covered elsewhere. I've had my Charge 3 for about 6 weeks & for a while it showed the daily amount of sleep I'd had.  But for the last 2/3 weeks all it shows is "sleep not tracked". I've reset the watch a couple of times but that hasn't helped.  Does anyone here have any suggestions on how to get it to display the sleep time again.  It's showing correctly in my phone, so I know that it is being recorded/tracked regularly.Thanks in advance 😊
And I do agree with the main point of this thread.....fitbit could benefit from some of Sleep Cycles features.
That’s a tough question.  Depends on your weight and what works for your body.  i Love my purple mattress, but it is soo heavy - won’t be moving it till I have to. But does give me back aches once in a while when I sleep more than 10 hours, since my body weight is under what is optimal for this mattress.but I love it because it puts me to sleep immediately and I have insomnia.  And when I wake up on a regular sleep night I feel super energized.   (found out after receiving it that it’s for ppl who weigh more than 140 lbs & I sleep 10+ hours on weekends bc I sleep 4 hours a night during the weeknights)
I have purchased the Premium, but am disappointed I don't seem to get it in the app for WIN10 PC. If there, where?
Hi @Pawland, I believe what you're seeing is net sleep, which is hours asleep minus awake time.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
I'm not looking at the wrong day. I look when I wake up. My old fitbit showed the details. This one mostly has to be synced to show the details. Once or twice it worked as it did before. It's annoying. I haven't moved so that can't be it. Thanks for the thoughts though.
I was diagnosed with narcolepsy in 1987. I’m 43 now and have had no cataplexy or hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations for about 10 years! I still don’t have normal sleep but it’s a lot better. I’m not sure how I cured myself. EMDR, Heart math might have helped to reduce stress levels.
I have a pretty bad sleep pattern too.This is typical
I actually do feel my Fitbit has helped me sleep better. I have now used my Charge2 for 1 1/2 years, and during this time I have been able to make out some patterns that are typical for me. One thing I have noted is that I sleep longer and get more deep sleep if I allow myself to go to bed according to my usual schedule and make sure I wind down and relax a while before bed time. I have also learned that after a short night with hardly any recorded deep sleep at all (usually because I stayed up late and/or was too wound up to relax), my sleep will usually be better than usual the next few nights, especially if I do some relaxation exercises and/or listen to soothing music before bed time. Over time my amount of sleep and deep sleep tend to show an average that is normal for my age, and this has made me fret a lot less about occasional bad nights, which, I believe in itself has made me sleep better. I still wake up a lot at night, but this no longer makes me worried, sine my Fitbit shows that my sleep is normal for my age (73). Since I started using the Fitbit my recorded deep sleep has actually gone up from 8-9% to 11%. I also found that it's definitely worth while to persist and try to get some more sleep whenever I wake up too early, even if I feel so awake that no more sleep seems possible. If I manage to get back to seep I actually frequently get another good session of deep sleep, even though it is towards the end of the night. It's as if the awake time has fooled my body into thinking it is the beginning of a new night's sleep. For me the most effective way of going back to sleep on such occasions is to simply turn on the radio (with earphones so as not to disturb my partner) or listen to a book (with snooze function set to 30 minutes). Usually this will make me go back to sleep within a few minutes.  Having said this, I am fully aware that the Fitbit is not a medical device, and that especially it's deep sleep recording is far from reliable (according to studies published in several threads it typically underestimates the amount of deep sleep). Even so I am prepared to give the Fitbit's deep sleep recording a fair bit of credit as it does indicate periods of restful sleep.
Apparently magnesium also helps decrease urinary frequency which is the reason I wake up so much at night!
well I have had the fitbit to bed 2 times now. My sleep efficancy on each night was 63% and 68%. I know my husband said I toss and turn a lot...Out of 8 hours of "sleep" i am only sleeping about 5 to 5.5 hours in the past two days.. I am always exsausted and sore. I am snippier than I intend to be...anyone got any ideas on how to sleep better WITHOUT medication?
When you go to bed to you put the flex in leep mode? to do this keep tapping the flez until it vibrates and two spaced out ots appear. Do the same to end sleep mode when  you get up.
I have been using sensitive for the last couple of weeks and was wondering what my data looked like in 'normal' and I can't seem to figure out how to do it.  I can change my charge HR setting to normal but the graphs and data all still read as sensitive.  I assumed (perhaps wrongly) that it just recorded all the movement and how it is intepreted is either normal or sensitive?  I am around 50% with 15-25 'wakeups' (though not actively away) on 8-9 hours of 'sleep' and am generally tired all the time.

What is the usual or average number of "awakenings" during the night of sleep?  Since it's counting turning over as awakening, what #s of awakenings are people getting recorded?  Or how many per hour of sleep?  Has anyone actually studied what is average with normal sleep?Thanks,Sugarnancy
Mine is not correct. It says I was asleep from 3 to 11. That's 7 hours. Why did it only log 4 hrs 40 mins? Restart my device It's charged fully.s
Is this the fitbit flex?
You did not understand his extremely valid issue. The issue is not work the bedtime reminders. Prior to the update, the Fitbit knew you were asleep and did not send notifications. Now, the only option is to set a schedule, which is unreasonable and unhelpful for those who have irregular sleep patterns, or to manually push the sleep button every single night and morning. Can Fitbit please bring back the ability for it to automatically turn off notifications when it knows you're sleeping? Additionally, I'm still getting some Fitbit challenge notifications even when I do hit the sleep button.
The new sleep stages graph shows thin red bars at the top of my graph. They are there in every one of the graphs since the update but nothing explains what they are. So what on earth are they???he new sleep stages graph shows thin red bars at the top of my graph. They are there in every one of the graphs since the update but nothing explains what they are.

Before updating my versa to the most recent software update I had notifications turned off when asleep. I can no longer find this option available. It instead only gives me the option to manually turn off before I go to sleep or set a schedule. I don’t have a regular sleeping schedule so that is not a good option for me. The previous option to disable notifications based on my sleeping heart rate was much better suited to me. Can I get this back? Pleeeeeasssse!
Hi,I’m trying to find out if the sleep graph in the app and the accuracy is similar whether you have a watch without HR or with HR? I currently have a Charge 2 and I’m considering buying a Flex 2 as a present for my husband for the summer (we’re often at the beach), but one of the aspects that he is most interested in is the sleep. Thank you

Sorry,Old post.. hope you see this. I do suffer from PLMS and found it striking how my FitBit HR does record sleep interruptions. With some accuracy I believe. My sleep doctor said I was one of the worst cases he has seen. I am on 1mg of Mirapex every night. If you know about Mirapex or other dopa derived remedies that is a very high dose. He thinks some sleep apnea is inolved. For apnea I measure 1.5 pm a scale of 5, which is too low for medical ins. to cover. I found regular exercise and good eating habits a big factor in getting enough sleep.Let me know if the Valerian helped at all. I avoid histamine OTC meds. In short time they become counterproductive. They are really fo temporary insomnia if you don't have other issues. Stay well! Dale
So now I see when I'm awake and restless and asleep. How do I make use of the information?
A northern Californian situated an hour from the wine country--and one who fully takes advantage of this geographical fact--I love wine.  I typically drink 1 or 2 glasses per evening with dinner, which is often withink 2 hours of bedtime  I have noticed time and again that on the occasonal nights I don't enjoy my vino, I sleep much better with less waking up throughout the night.  While it is scientifically established that alcohol does disrupt sleep patterns, I was once again pleasantly reminded of this fact last night--when I didn't enjoy a glass or two with dinner.  Just food--er--drink for thought!

Vitamins at bed time sounds like a good idea, I've thought of this before but didn't give it a try.I know that the body regenerates during sleep and heaven knows I could sure use a little extra regenerating but I never seem to sleep longer than 5 hours, so I'll give it a try and keep you posted thanks for the tip.(((mtlee)))
I know it seems hard but you have to find a way to get to bed earlier. I was the same as you and I didn't even realize how exhausted I was. I got to the point where I was so tired I could not wake up in the morning. I ended up losing my job because I couldn't get to work on time.  When I finally was diagnosed with sleep apnea and started getting more sleep I was amazed at what a difference it made to get a good night's sleep. It truly is night and day.Have you read about "sleep hygiene" - things you can do to help you sleep?

This is very peculiar. Several folks are having the same issue. I did chat with a FITBIT rep last week and they told me to plug my tracker into the charger, holding side button until I see battery icon and black screen. Then a progress bar afterwards. Needless to say, this did not work. So I will be contacting fit bit once again. Thanks so much for sharing your findings with me.
I see what seems to be an activity log entry that converted my sleep history (with the restless and awake data) into a useless regular activity -- how do I undo this?  The operation appears to have "converted" (not "moved") the sleep history.  In the activity record, there's an option to checkbox 'this is a sleep record'.. ..but if I check that, what will happen?
There is already great advice posted but would add the removal of all white light such as digital clocks or watches.  Use bed only for sleeping - no TV or reading.  If you awake at night and cannot get back to sleep within 15 minutes, get up, do something else and then return in 30 minutes.
I am often awake in the middle of the night for an hour or more. Sometimes I get up and sometimes stay in bed, reading or listening to podcasts. My Inspire II tends to detect the start and end of those waking periods fairly accurately but will often identify periods of light sleep in between, when I am actually awake. I assume that is because I am resting quietly with little movement and a low heart rate. The result is to over-estimate my time asleep and assign a higher sleep score than is justified.My question is whether it is possible to change the labelling of those internal segments from "light sleep" to "awake"? I know how to edit the start and end times for the sleep log, but the segments in question are in the middle of the night rather than at either extreme. I'd be grateful for any suggestions.Thanks.

In and of itself the sleep data isn't going to mean much. What you want to look for is a pattern. For example, on average a person goes through 90 minute sleep cycles over and over all night long. So, you go to sleep, move a bit for a few minutes then settle down. At some point later you will see a movement, possibly you rolled over or moved your arms. This means you were at a lighter level of sleep, not necessarily awake. Then you will have another period of time of no movement and then another time of movement. Most people, on average end up with some movement every night. I personally have about 10 times 'awake' and my sleep stats say I am at about 97%. I feel rested in the morning and think I am a good sleeper. I may or may not actually wake up during the night. When I do it is at roughly 3am and I usually have to go to the bathroom. I fall back to sleep immediately. I sleep on average 7.5 hours a night. This is what the fitbit has taught me about myself. Once you see your pattern you can find out if this seems normal or healthy or if you might have a sleep disorder that means you should check with your dr.
This is very interesting. I've actually never heard about this but it makes sense. I'm used to taking my vitamins early in the morning, I don't know why the majority of people tend to take them in the morning but it wouldn't hurt changing this. Thank you for sharing this with us @Awen!

I turn “sleep mode” on my Charger 4 when I’m finally laying down to sleep. When I wake up - like 2:30am and then still awake at 4:30am - I get up and turn sleep off.  However sometimes I’m able to go back to sleep 30min later for a few hours.

I’ve manually updated the time but then it just adds a new line as new data instead of combining them. Any suggestions?

Last night according to my Fitbit, set on sensitive, I was asleep from 10:53 til around 1 am. I rolled over at 11:23 to look at the clock and it didn't even register movement. I've suspected for some time that it wasn't reliable, but this proves it. Some nights I feel like I've been awake most of the night and it shows I slept well while other nights I feel like I slept better than usual and it show I was restless way more than usual. I realize that it is movement based, but if I actually roll over and look at the clock it seems to me that it should show something!
There are many effective ways. I have aggregate and share here you can refer to: https://trustedmattress.com/how-to-fix-sleep-schedule/
This spike in heart rate is not an artifact of the Fitbit. It appears in about 90% of my sleep patterns of heart rate. Been seeing it for several years. My PCP was perplexed but suggested I wear a heart monitor (Holter type device) for 2 weeks. That will finish in a few days and then I mail the device to be read. Should have more info then. Will let you know.
I see time slept for the night but no weekly averages with your link.

This is actualy reall interesting to see, i tend to have a lot of restlessness during the night, being restless for anything over 2 hours during my sleep, and it seems to take forever to fall aslepp, some of my patterns seem pretty similar to yous, i have mine to high senstivity on my non dominant hand. i dont suppose they gave you any tips on how to help with your sleep pattern, or sleep efficency, mine is constantly quite low.
So, I'm still having problems. Sometimes my Versa 2 is still only recording 3-4 hours of sleep. I go to bed at 11pm and get up at 8am. Sometimes I get up in the middle of the night, and other times I don't. It really shouldn't matter though. It should show that as awake time, and not totally just cut off my sleep at 3-4 hours. I cannot figure it out for the life of me. Anyone have a fix?
Sleep tracking is a plesent surprise for me since getting my fitbit less than a month now. I always wondered why I felt tired in the morning, I realise I'm restless a lot.  While I may be in bed for 8 hours, I'm only getting 6 - 6.5 hours of sleep.
Very cool - thanks! I'll try chilling out in the evenings
I have no problem falling asleep.  I usually fall asleep easily around 9pm.  However, if my dog wakes me up to be let out to potty, I often can't go back to sleep.  Last night, my pup woke me up at 2am and I couldn't fall back asleep!  I laid awake in bed, trying to force myself to sleep.  I tried reading and counting sheep.  I finally gave up at 4:30am and pulled out my phone to start scrolling (my alarm goes off at 5:15, so there was no hope I'd get any sleep).  Needless to say, I've been up since 2am today.  😞 I have no idea how to turn off my brain once my body wakes up in the middle of the night.  It's very frustrating when you have an active mind at night! And of course, my Fitbit thinks I still got 8 hours of sleep when I really got around 5 hours.

Hello,My versa 2 records sleep data but theses show only on the app. I can't see them on my watchThank you.
The sleep stats on the fitbit are normed for age so if you are 65 years old and getting 70% efficiency, that means the 70% is for your age group and is low. I am 52 and get about 97% on average, for my age group. If I compare to other age groups my % changes.
Steve,Thanks for the advice.  I have tried that.  Worked with customer service over and over and didn't get it resolved.  I have tried both settings with the sensitivity with the same result.  I don't think I'm restless, tend to get up a few times to use the restroom, but that's about it as far as I know.  It will track if I do it manually.
Hi juanI understand your comment. I’m not try to hold fitbit to any accuracy level. I can tell you that I’ve tested the pulse number with what the doctor office gets and it’s pretty close.  I did get a test on my heart and the doctor said my valve leakage is very low and rated excellent as did my stroke volume.   He still wants to get a different test. But he said athletes can have lower rates than the average person.  So basically I’m ok but he’s ordering some other tests.  Told me not to worry but that a complete work up should be made to determine if it’s just normal for me or an electrical or node issue. He’s over my head now. I was just curious what other people who are active have for resting pulse thank you
Has your sleep band "wore out" from use? What do you use for the sleep tracking if your sleep now?
Hi When not turning off the alarm, it goes off again in 9 minutes.

My score last night was 83. I feel asleep a little before 9, which is early for me. I think I'm still adapting to the time change. I woke up around 3 am and had trouble getting back to sleep. I listened to podcasts and finally fell asleep after 45 minutes or so. Then I woke up for the day at 6:30 am. I had 7 hours 48 minutes of sleep.

Hello "Fitbitters", I wear my Charge HR all the time and I was wondering how to read/look up my HR during sleep. I want to know what my HR iis while sleeping. I am familiar with the Awake/Sleep/Restless stuff, but I cannot figure out the HR durign sleep. For me,it is important toknow what my "real" resting HR is.Any nsight is greatly appreciate. Keep on "Fitbitting"
here is a screen shot of a few nights
Hello,I am on my 4th Fitbit charge HR over the last 3 years (I am hard on watches). I am very satisfied with it's performance. My question is how low will it record or will it chart lower than 38 BPM? About every third night or so my watch spikes down to 38 and cuts out for about 20 minutes or so. My resting heart rate is usually between 47-51. Will another fitbit model go lower?
I am very tired today and noticed I had almost 2.5 hours of REM and just over a half hour of deep. Usually I get around 1.5 hours of each, roughly. But this lack of deep sleep also happens quite often, along with extremely irregular sleep cycles.I am moderately active and eat pretty healthy, I go to bed at a good time every night, use half a mg melatonin and half a unisom with half a diluted shot of 12% liquor to help me sleep. I also take a small dose (5 mg ER of Adderall every morning) which helps me sleep big time. My doctor knows I do this and has okayed the melatonin and unisom at night with the adderall in the morning.Before doing this medication routine I had severe insomnia. So now I get usually 6.5-8 hours of sleep and sleep well through the night, but my cycle is very strange and I usually seem to be lacking in deep sleep. I'd say my fitbit is misreading my cycles, but when it says I don't enough deep I feel miserable, very tired. What does it mean to be getting little deep but a lot of REM? And why are my cycles so crazy and irregular half the time? Is this sign of a sleep disorder, or is fitbit possibly misreading my cycles? I would really like to add photos of my cycles but don't know how.
HiThanks for taking time to help - that’s actually what I did as an experiment - i changed start time by one minute and it popped back to the original time. Thanks and hope your own question is answered by fitbit.Sent from my iPad
@LedMatrix  That is interesting. I'd read the one article on too much sleep, but this one seems more reasonable. Thanks for sharing this.

How does the sleep tracker help me get better sleep?  Yes, I know that I sleep/wake/sleep/wake all night (and I can feel it in the morning, too!) but how does know that I get 96% sleep help me to sleep better? Thanks in advance,Marcia
With hubby and dogs in the same bed I'm not sure how accurate that would be to just have it ON the bed, but last night I tried something different, I wore it a little higher on my wrist and it still tracked my sleep and pulse and I was able to get to sleep and stay asleep most of the night! So, hopefully, this will be a good solution for me because I really want to see what kind of sleep patterns I have.
Hi, I often want to edit my wake up time because 1) the app uses the time I open the app as wake up time 2) the app adds sleep time when actually I have stayed in bed reading, so awake and not sleeping Often the edit is not “picked up”, it just doesn’t change after editing. Lately what happens too is that the data of the night disappears after the edit and only reappears after closing and opening the app. This seems being a bug and a very frustrating one for me… what should take a second takes 4-5 times of opening and closing the app again, or I just give up.
What kind of fitbit do you have?
mine states it did not record sleep at all, however, when I press the sleep icon in my profile it shows the stats! they appear to be correct but on the fitbit itself it says not recorded!
I’m 37 female, fitness instructor as a job. General resting heart rate is fairly steady; snapshot of my whole day, it will track low 60’s as my daily average. Teach classes on most days.  Yes, going through a bit of stress at the moment.  Noticed, I’m clenching my jaw a lot, and feeling anxious and tired during the day.  Couple  of days ago, and, about 2 weeks ago, my heart rate during sleep tracked anywhere between 90-140 during the whole time whilst I’m asleep, then coming back to normal levels when I’m awake? I’ve had my Fitbit for a while now, usually my heart rate during sleep tracks anywhere between mid 40’s to low 60’s and has never changed until these two recent episodes ? Is this sign of a problem beginning? May be sleep apnea? Are these watches accurate? Can anomalies happen, or could this be a genuine sign of a health concern? Anyone else experienced this? I have a snapshot of the tracking but not sure how to attach to my post ? Thanks 🙂
Typically, level should be 95-100% to be considered good.It's difficult to tell the percentage in the graph since it just says "high" and "low", but according to fitbit, "Seeing high variations is a clue that you may be experiencing breathing disturbances during sleep.so, I guess you're good!

THANK YOU! I will try that!
I can't figure out how to post a screenshot sorry! Anyway you all get the point. I'm interested to hear everyone's experiences!!
Had an update on my Inspire HR a few days ago and now the sleep tracker is disabled on my fitbit and doesn't even have an option on my fitbit app for it. How can this be fixed? Thanks for your help!
Thanks. This was annoying me , glad to know it’s a quick fix.
It's magic  Try this out, something magical will happen. Seriously.
Helena ArriazaThough I did read your post but I think it is critical to sleep a little more than what u do. I did some sleep studies during my post graduation in 2004 and did find that 5 hours of sleep or more did great on my subjects and patients in terms of   playing a critical role in immune functions, metabolism, memory, learning, and other vital functions .So maybe just sleep  a hour or so more it will help in the long run.I would sound like a doctor but then I was keen on posting on this subject.

Hey @AnnaMccoy Nice to see you around!
 
You're not alone in this, many users has this issues but it's great to know that  you're looking for options that can help you. I suggest you can check our groups in the Fitbit app add some friends to your list. In that way you will feel like you have someone there that is waiting for you to get up and start moving. That helped me to start working out again since I just had a C-section and it was really difficult to sleep and work out again.

You have the right idea... pulse oximeters are only estimates to get you "ballpark figures" and not FDA accurate (as with a blood draw, ouch!).  There are many factors that cause variations and thus inaccuracies with these devices such as skin color, smoking, room lighting, poor blood circulation due to arm and clothing positioning, etc.  It is suggested that you can expect a +/- 4% variation in accuracy with pulse oximeters vs blood draw measurements.  Since a watch does not have as secure placement against the skin, I would suppose yet another avenue for variation and thus a further decrease in accuracy is possible perhaps.  These devices are not true medical devices and are only meant to give you awareness of when you should consider seeking medical advice.  Fitbit's own advice is as follows... "The data provided by Fitbit SpO2 is intended to be a close estimation of your blood oxygen saturation levels, but may not be precisely accurate. You should not use or rely on Fitbit SpO2 for any medical purposes."  However my take on it is this: I'd rather have this estimate available to me than not... so thank you Fitbit for including it in the feature set for this watch.  So to answer your question above... so far I get an average anywhere from 93% up to 96% with my lowest in range ever being down to 90%-93%.  Remember with a recognized 4% variation for the pulse oximeter technology, my 93% average could theoretically have been as low as 89% true oxygen saturation (time to consult a medical professional) and my lowest in range could have dropped to as low as 86%, gasp!  I'm not worried however as I don't wake up continuously all night long and I feel well rested in the mornings.
'Begin sleep now' was originally for trackers without heart rate monitors that could only detect sleep from lack of motion.  If you have a tracker with heart rate monitor, you are better off not using 'begin sleep now".  However I do use it occasionally if I want it to record a nap of less than an hour that is too short to otherwise be detected, with the understanding I will not get full details on it.

@nohypochondria thanks for your input. Please keep in mind the differences between Normal and Sensitive settings:

The normal setting counts significant movements as being awake (such as rolling over) and is appropriate for most users.
The sensitive setting will cause your tracker to record nearly all movements as time spent awake. This setting may be helpful for users with sleep disorders, or those who wear their tracker somewhere other than the wrist while asleep.

Learn more here!
 
@Laurennicole87 please double check to make sure your Sleep Tracking is set on Normal. It seems very likely that your settings are set to Sensitive. 
 
To change from Sensitive to Normal, follow these steps:
1. Login to your account at Fitbit.com
2. Click Settings in the top right corner (the gear icon)
3. Click on 'Settings' from the drop-down menu. 
4. In the left column, click on Devices
5. Click on your tracker type (Surge, Charge HR, Blaze, etc)
6. Scroll down to Sleep Tracking
7. Switch from Sensitive to Normal
8. Make sure you save and sync so that the changes are applied to your account
 
I've included a screenshot of the area where Sleep Tracking settings are located on your fitbit.com profile.
You'll notice the last row, titled Sleep Tracking. 

 
I hope this helps - learn a bit more about how to change from Sensitive to Normal in this Help article. 
 
Let me know how it goes or if you have any questions!

Hi tbond,  Yes, there is a silent alarm that buzzes.  On your dashboard, click the little gear icon in the upper right corner.  Then click settings.  Next, look on the left and click alarm.  It will walk you through the short process of setting yours.  Be sure to make sure you select a.m or p.m.  Hope that helps.  Stephen

That's ok, no need to apologise 🙂 Customer support directed me to restart the Versa 2, change settings from 'normal' to 'sensitive', and it's been all good since.. I now have all the sleep cycle info AND the aggregate 'Sleep Score', so problem solved. Thanks 😁
When finding being rested out in the morning. Check if sleep tracking is set to 'sensitive', if it's set to sensitive, change it to 'normal': Go to: URL: Click to go to the tracker settings * There's no save button but the setting will be saved. After the next sync, the new mode will be used.
Me, varies between 2 - 5 times per night. Many times it's from a cat jumping on me.
I have my fitbit flex set on the sensitive mode but want to compare each night with the normal setting. I cannot find out how to edit the results though I've seen posts by people who say that this function is possible. Does anyone know how to edit sleep results to compare both modes of sleep?
Thanks. but can I still contact support even if my product is no longer under warranty?
Edited- Never mind. I was just trying to be helpful.
Hello sleep community! I was always fascinated by the Fitbit sleep data, but it wasn't until I started tracking other variables like caffeine, exercise, meal times etc. that things got really interesting.  Anyway, let's just say I went DEEP on this topic! The result is a little ebook called Sleep Like a Lion, which is currently free on Amazon. I don't want to break any forum rules by posting a link in here, but it's basically a Fitbit story so I hope this could be acceptable (perhaps a moderator can confirm? 🙂  Anyway, I hope it adds to the sleep discussion - and that it helps you if you do pick it up! Thanks,  Paul
Those running categories get automatically assigned based on amount of activity on the forums.  With more posts, etc it would change to a "higher" category of runner.  You have no control over it.  It is meant just as a "fun" thing, just ignored by most.

Sorry to hear others also have higher heart rates while sleeping. I have nightly chest pain (working with a team but still unsolved). Trying to attach screenshot but no camera icon and app won’t let me paste copy. Needless to say, there is no hammock trend and all is above resting.
Updated with settings set to normal from Thursday on. So I'll ask again, is this bad? With the normal setting its counting times that I know I'm awake as being restless. That's why I changed from normal to sensitive a while back. But Thursday and on are under the normal setting.
I started waking early - with an alarm when I was 13 years old (I'm 76 now) because I had a morning paper route. I've never gotten out of the habit. Starting in my 20's I woke, like you, around 5AM without an alarm. I worried about it until I read an article in a business magazine from someone who simply accepted it and used the morning time to accomplish necessary tasks, and to enjoy the morning - I especially enjoyed New England summer mornings. I simply learned to live with being an ultimate morning person. I haven't used an alarm for decades, and as I've grown older my wake time has gradually  become later. It may be best to accept that you're a morning person and enjoy the wake time, possibly adjusting the time you go to bed to make sure you get enough sleep. Now I wake between 5:30 and 6, walk about 3 miles, make breakfast, always oatmeal in the winter and read or keep my journal until my wife wakes up at about 7:30. I think "morning people" are happier because they are happy to wake up and enjoy mornings.  Enjoy yourself and make the best of who you are!
I start the sleep mode when I'm about ready to get under the covers.  Since it will record my activities (whether sleep or relessness) I can figure that out when I synch my Flex to my dashboard.  It's amazing to know how many times to move while sleeping. If the finger tapping isn't working, try using your knuckle.  You need to tap at the correct spot.  Some time I have to tap it 2 or 3 times before it goes into the sleep mode.  You can feel the vibration once it's engaged.  To test that you are in sleep mode, tap it and see that you have the two blinking lights going back and forth - that's sleep mode.
If your using an android phone and recently updated alot of people including me  seems to have  lots of yellow spikes, there is some sort of glitch, not sure if that's what you have or not?

Mine was the giraffe (first month using the Fitbit).
Hi, mine was very much like this. Sleep study done. Sleep apnea. But my nightly pattern still shows me waking up, but not as vividly. I don’t remember it either.
My fitbit seems to think I get little to no REM or Deep Sleep. Is this happening to anyone else? I have a sleep disorder, but it involves sleeping too much and doesn't result in non REM or Deep Sleep. I just have trouble trusting my results and was wondering whether anyone else had the same feelings. 
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
@YojanaFitbit  Believe it or not, tonight I slept for 7:30h for the first time in 2 months! What I did different was, I went to bed fairly early, at 9PM, read a book, until about 9:40PM until my eyes were almost closing shut by themselves. Normally I would watch something on tv before bed.  Weird thing is I've tried reading before bed and it didn't really change anything in the past. I'll try this out for a couple more nights and see if that was what made the difference, or something else I did that day.

What should a good night's sleep pattern look like?
@TaniaRyl - I’m curious. Which free app are you using?
Previously I had a sleeping results every morning on the screen in the Fitbit app, today I woke up and nothing. I have a screenshot but it seems this window doesn't allow to attach anything. 
My boyfriend used my Fitbit for a while and changed some settings. How do I get my sleeping diagram back?
I am confused. My sense, knows when I go to sleep and doesn't push notifications. I do not set a sleep schedule or put myself in sleep mode- it just knows. If I am having a particularly restless night, it may slip one through, but for the most part it doesn't. you can also put your watch on DND by swiping left. If you have an alarm set up it obviously won't work, but it won't let any notifications go through until you take it off DND.

@forcr There are two sets of graphs on your Sleep Page at https://www.fitbit.com/sleep.
 
The top two, labeled "Time asleep" and "Times awoken", include only your night's sleep.
 
The bottom two, labeled "Total time asleep" and "Total times awoken", include your night's sleep, as well as any naps you might log during the day.
 
So if you don't log anything aside from a single sleep log for the night, these two sets will be identical. If you log additional sleep logs outside of your night's rest, the bottom graph will include them. I hope that clears things up!

My husband and I both recently got the fitbit flex, mostly for the same reasons. We're needing to improve our stamina and fitness (me more than him--I'm disabled and almost totally sedentary). I was thrilled to find that it monitored sleep as well. That's actually what caused Allan to get his. He would be snoring for two hours and then wake up to tell me that he just can't fall asleep. Since getting the fitbit, he's found that he DOES sleep 7-8 hours/night with >85% sleep efficiency. He's of an age where he gets up a couple of times in the night to use the bathroom so that's the major 'kink' in his sleep patterns. I, on the other hand, average between 4-5 hours/sleep despite generally being in bed more hours than he is. I have a history of PTSD and have never slept as well at night as I do in the daytime which is why I spent about half of my working career working the night shift. However, that didn't fly after marrying my husband. Now, despite meds, it frequently takes 1-2 hours to fall asleep and I'm waking 17-30 times/night. The one good thing about this is that I can now take empirical data in the form of the fitbit reports to my docs but I'm incredibly frustrated by this. The meds they have me on should put a rhinoceros to sleep for a week. If I don't take them, I will go days without sleeping. Anyone got any suggestions? I'm hoping that the weather gets better soon so I'm not in so much pain. We just joined a gym and I'd like to give the "Active Older Adults" yoga and cardio classes a shot. Both of them can be adapted to the level of the individual--there are quite a few people who do the whole class sitting in the chair and working from there while there are others who don't sit at all. I'm trying not to nap in the daytime but that's really hard because that's when I get my best quality sleep. If anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
My gf and I have had our Inspire 2 for a lot longer and they just stopped tracking sleep a few nights ago too. It's not you, it's a larger issue that I haven't seen a verified solution for yet.

Hello @WillieP, thanks for joining the Fitbit Community, it's great to have you on board. 
 
I appreciate you have brought this to my attention. I would like to ask you to restart your tracker, then go to your device Settings in the online Dashboard. Check your sleep setting, if it's set to Sensitive, change it to Normal. 
 
After that, use your tracker as you normally would at night, making sure it is snug on your wrist. If you get 2 chunks of sleep, the next night try to sleep with the tracker on your non-dominant hand.I hope this can be helpful, give it a try and keep me posted in case you need anything else.

@ScottSmith is the heart rate still being detected? Sometimes the Inspire 2 gets switched into "Clip" mode. Then it stops reading heart rate and can't give sleep details.

Found this thru Google, I have the exact same thing.  Happens every single night.  HR goes from resting (~60-65) up to around 80BPM for the first hour or so that I'm asleep then drops sharply into low-mid 50s.  Like you it doesn't matter how I'm feeling, what I ate/etc. it's the same every time.
Does having a baby monitor in your room affect your REM sleep and therefore cause mommy brain?
I want to bump this topic up and see if I can get a better sense of what a normal score is. I use the sensitive setting (which I just found out is kind of irrelevant since Fitbit stores both the Sensitive and Normal results and it is more of a difference in the view). But in terms of comparing myself to others, I am curious to hear what people tend to get on average. I can get my score into the 80s% with pre-bedtime meditation and other ideal conditions, but it is hard to keep it there consistently. I usually average in the mid, to low-70s. but it goes between 50 and 80 night to night.  What is your average?
I am with you in needing to disconnect from the electronics.  I'm not sure about how much deep sleep you actually need but my body tells me it is more that 30 - 40 minutes.  I feel ok if I get at least an hour but much less than that and I just feel tired all day.  I am going to try to go electronic free from 8:00 tonight and the next couple of nights and see if that helps.    I have been walking/jogging at 8:00 because it so hot here during the day.  I may have to start exercising at 6 am instead if the electronic fast doesn't work.  Good luck finding better sleep!
Hi MAry,I am a newbie and was wondering the same, I had a quick look at the supported devices list thinking surely iPhone 4 would be there, but it doesnt seem to be. So sync isnt possible....? iPad can, but I havent been able to find the ipad app... Then again I am a newbie! I will keep watching your responses, Not much help thoguh, sorry! cheers s
Aww, thanks!  I'm getting a sleep study next week.  Until fitbit, I really had no idea this was my sleep pattern, so I'm grateful that it brought this to my attention.  Now that fitbit has opened my eyes, maybe I'll be able to get some more shut-eye 🙂
New to FitBit.  First day / night.  Tracked OK yesterday.I put it into sleep mode last night, and woke it this morning. When I synced my Fit Bit... no sleep data.  Help! 🙂What do I do to have the sleep/awake/restless etc show up?Thank you. 🙂
@nohypochondria: yes indeed I see this happening in my results too. I have tried both Normal and Sensitive modes and your observation is true for me too.  Surely this means the Charge HR tracker is completely invalid as an even half-reasonable measurer of sleep? If so I want my money back. If not then please - how do I use it to get sensible measurements?
Not able to sync sleep
Yep what @JohnnyRow said. This caught me out too - it's so confusing that they use similar colours for this more basic way of showing the data. Ha, I was really disappointed as I had thought it showed my sneaky naps were excellent quality and therefore totally justified!
Right before I go to bed I start my sleep mode on my iPhone. It has become a habit now and when I wake up I turn my alarm off and them hit my wake up on my iPhone.Hope this helps, just remember it will become a habit just like wanting to reach your other fitbit goals! Good luck
I have just purchased my first Fitbit, the Fitbit Flex 2 and I'm quite confused about the total sleep stats. Fitbit seems to only treat deep sleep as time spent 'asleep' and light sleep is considered 'restless' which apparently isn't regarded as 'sleep'. As a previous Jawbone UP user I am used to seeing my total hours of sleep (e.g 6h) and then that is split into deep and light sleep (e.g. 3.5h deep sleep, 2.5h light sleep). From what I can tell, on Fitbit you can only see either the total time spent in bed (6h) which won't be split into deep/light sleep or the view where deep/light sleep are separated, but in this scenario the total sleep would only be 3.5h, even though I have actually slept for 6h.  I realise in the web dashboard I can see 'time spent in bed' but as only deep sleep counts towards the score, my stats are going to be way off my sleep goal, which is 8h. Does Fitbit really expect people to have 7-9 hours of deep sleep per night, as that is their recommended goal? Also, on the app, if I want to look at the broken down view of deep/light sleep it doesn't seem to show 'total time in bed' at all, and vice versa.  Is there a setting I am missing somewhere that would rectify this?
I take two tablespoons of calcium / magnesium.  It comes in a bottle and is available in a variety of flavors.  In colder weather, chamomile tea also helps before bed.  Finally, some light stretching and praying--including giving thanks for my blessings--helps me.  I also find that alcohol too close to bedtime disrupts my sleep patterns.  I enjoy my glass of red wine most nights, but seem to stay asleep more during the night when I skip my wine.  I also am learning to avoid caffeine after about 3:00 p.m.

Your oxygen levels do decrease while your sleeping since your breathing is steady and slower. Your oxygen level will very based on the type of sleep you have as well; light sleep, deep sleep, or REM sleep. 90% or higher is normal oxygenation when sleeping.  Then factor in mouth breathing, illness, stuffy nose, etc. can change your O2 levels as well.
I also got the Pfizer vaccine. About 4 days later all my symptoms are gone as well. On day two I got short or breath, dizzy and a headache. I have not had covid before. It I’m hearing people at work saying that if they had covid beige it is hitting them a little harder. I am also hearing that if feels like covid from them. On the list of not normal symptoms is the shortness of breath that I had for two days but I had others at work have it as well.
I use the ResMed AirFit F20 with a full face mask. I tried the one that goes under the nose but it did not work for me. This one is comfortable and effective ... at least for me. My Fitbit sleep reports verify the effectiveness. On a side note, my insurance will not pay for extras of these and the ones they provide do not always last me the 90 days they say it should. But Amazon sells just this piece for a fraction of what I would pay if I ordered it directly from my normal supplier (Binsons)
I see time slept for the night but no weekly averages with your link.
That's an unusual amount of restless. No wonder you're tired. If those were mine, I'd want to get a sleep study done.  Which Fitbit are you using?

Hello there! I'm a new user since one week ago. I've worn my Fitbit every night since I got him.It seems to me that I've been sleeping worse now than before. Every night at 3 I'm awake for no reason.I've checked my settings but I could not find anything about notifications at night.Could it be that my Fitbit vibrates in the middle of the night without me knowing it?I did not receive any calls or messages during the night, so that could not be it. Can anyone help me, because I'd still like to track my sleeping habits, but I'd like a good night's rest too.Thank you very much!
I am just curious what others are getting as a sleep efficiency score. I am averaging a 92 percent efficiency.
Now I have a green star next to EVERY NIGHT of sleep (it's supposed to indicate that you met your 8 hour goal). However, it's even next to nights where Fitbit says I slept 3 1/2 hours. Heck, it's there EVERY night no matter how short or how long I slept. This whole sleep log info is horribly messed up.
I think the only way I would know how to do it is to copy the page into a doc and then print it.

Greetings. For a long time, since I got my Fitbit One several years ago, I never paid much attention to the sleep tracking part of the value we pay for.  https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2016/05/transcript-the-sleep-smarter-book/ I was listening to this podcast - and there was a mention of looking at those intervals when you were "restless" and seeing what your heart rate was during those times to determine if something more serious might be going on. If Greenfield is to be trusted, although he didn't use a fitbit to tell him, we could actually (if we have an HR part to our fitbit, like I do now with the Charge HR) look at those times of insomnia and see what our heart rate was immediately prior to that as a potential clue to something that may need to be addressed. In Greenfield's case, it was parasite's that he got from swallowing bad water during a triathlon.  The only question is if the premium section will show heart rate while sleeping....I just thought that it might be helpful, as I never thought to look at my heart rate while I was sleeping.

Hi @winnipegwalker, Can you explain a little more what a bad's night sleep is for you, and how you feel the next morning? Not getting enough deep sleep shows up differently for me than not getting enough REM, or too much awake time.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
When you think to buy moving boxes , first check the quality of those boxes and whether they are of convenient size or not to place the things in it easily. Then think of getting the one for you.
I feel the two are somewhat related. The more restless the sleep, the less deep sleep there tends to be. Deep sleep usually occurs in the earlier part of the night, so getting nice and exhausted before bedtime can help. On nights with good deep sleep I tend to be tired and fall asleep quickly.

I just read the notes on the sleep iq app. It seems as though they designed it only to import fitbit data to their app but don't allow for exporting data to the fitbit app.
I have begun using lavender essential oil. I keep it by the bed and dab some on my wrists, temples and behind the ears. It works wonders to relax me so I can fall asleep more quickly.
Smart alarm is definitely needed! Common Fitbit, should not be that difficult to implement now that you have REM, light and deep sleep tracking implemented.
Hi @Alikabir07 That's a good question, not an easy one to answer. What I recommend is starting to meditate daily. It helps the mind unwind, and also gives a space that one can investigate the cause of emotional disturbance, get to the root of them and heal them. That's what has worked for me. You may also want to take a look at the Deep Sleep thread that is pinned near the top of this forum. It is full of tips on getting better sleep. During sleep, especially REM sleep, is when we process a lot of thoughts and emotions, so getting a good night's sleep is very important. Good luck.

Thanks for sharing. I'm a 30 year RN and I have some major issues with how our health is being mismanaged.Dan
At first I was all to aware of wearing my band to bed also.  After a few nights I forgot about it and just sleep, toss & turn, etc all night and all is good.  Give it a 2nd chance.  I do NOT nowever wear mine in the shower - I want to keep it as sanitary and dry as possible.  I put it back on as soon as I dry off.
I also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis and I experience both hypo- and hyperthyroid symptoms. As much as I've understood, treating the thyroid with medications will not take away the symptoms, because the problem isn't your thyroid, it's your immune system (which is attacking you, instead of protecting you and it can start attacking other parts of you, that's why having one autoimmune illness increases the probability of getting another one). So the first thing is to find out what is flaring up your immune system and causing inflammation. In most cases, it's food, but also stress, over exercising. For me, the biggest thing was gluten (probably because of molecular mimicry - its molecularly very similar to the thyroid and my immune system starts attacking it alongside with my thyroid). I didn't realise it was affecting me so much after I had stopped eating it completely for 4 months, accidentally ate a sausage containing wheat and woke up in the middle of the night with a pounding heart (10 bpm higher than my usual heart rate) and anxiety. Also, fun fact, I thought I had anxiety, even started seeing a psychotherapist, which didn't help at all and no wonder it didn't help, it was a Hashimoto's symptom 🙂 Inflammation in the body can cause a lot of inflammation in the brain, causing anxiety, panic attacks, depression, brain fog, memory problems etc. So yes, heart rate is connected to Hashimoto's (based on my own experience) and the fatigue is definitely connected to Hashimoto's, no matter what your lab results say. There's even a book about it: "Why Do I Still Have Thyroid Symptoms When My Lab Tests Are Normal" - by dr. Datis KharrazianIzabella Wentz also has great information in her books and blog: https://thyroidpharmacist.com/articles/Just last week, I found dr. Martin Rutherford on youtube with very informative videos about Hashimoto's: https://www.youtube.com/c/MartinRutherfordPowerHealthReno/videos
I see this thread started a while back, but wanted to share a similar experience.My deep sleep and light sleep times commonly fall within (and sometimes exceed) the benchmark averages. However, my REM percentages are so low, there is often no percentage reading and it falls well below the benchmarks on the bar graph.Initially I was concerned, then I thought my charge 2 might be inaccurate. I decided not to worry about it too much; since that won't help me sleep (!).I had extremely bad sleep for a number of years when I lost my wife to cancer.  For me, many of the tips for better sleeping help a lot... including guided meditations, occasional magnesium supplement (I use something called "Calm"), not exercising right before bed, eating better, etc. etc.I still hope that the Charge 2 is wrong and I'm getting more REM. Interested to see more responses in this thread.
My charge HR does not calculate sleep correctly how come ? from 10:48 pm till - 3:28 am it says 1hr.16 min.
Does anyone know the highest sleep score possible?  83 seems to be the best I can do.
Great idea!  Here are comparisons: Monday first, little activity, Tuesday some activity then today..how do I add photos?
Does it just show your time awake? I thought it was supposed to show every time you moved around. But compared to my sleep study, it doesn't even come close. In fact, a joke in comparison.
I'm guessing you must be using a tracker without heart rate monitor.They can consider at least an hour of inactivity as sleep.  I would think if you just wave that arm around occasionally, that would be enough to let it realize you are awake.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I've slept worse than that.  For over a year, I would take 2-3 hours to fall asleep; wake up repeatedly and spend over an hour at a time lying awake; and, eventually, developed terminal insomnia around 4am-5am and would be permanently-awake.  I slept 2-3 hours each night at best, across a 10-hour span. In Normal mode, the Fitbit thought I was getting 5.5-6.5 hours.  Eventually I noticed Sensitive mode was about right.  I'd started noting the times when I woke up and checking against both graphs to see which most-accurately reflected when I was asleep and awake, and selecting Normal or Sensitive tracker each morning based on that. Research papers discussing sleep actigraphy have noted that it detects sleep time accurately if less-sensitive to minor movements when sleeping well, and more-sensitive to minor movements when sleeping poorly; invert the conditions and you get bad data.  This is known among sleep disorder researchers to apply to the Fitbit, although apparently Fitbit's staff doesn't know this. So yeah.  If your graphs are accurate, you need to see a doctor about insomnia.

My Charge Fitbit 5 Sp0 is not tracking properly either.  I have called twice and they ran me through the protocol to make sure i was set up properly.  Thing is I get three successive reads, then nothin, then  I get a one night read and then nothing and then I will get every second night.  I am really puzzled and my warranty is about to expire.  I did not have this issue with my Tracker 4.
OK so I average about 7 hours sleep (sometimes 6 sometimes 😎 and roughly 1 hour of deep sleep. I couldn't tell you the last time I woke up and felt refreshed. I do have hypothyroidism but I've always been under the impression that if it is controlled by medication (which my blood tests shows it is) then I shouldnt be suffering from the symptoms. I have had anaemia in the past but my latest blood test has ruled this out.It doesnt seem to matter how much or how little sleep I get and not really sure what to try to improve my sleep quality. Just after some other peoples opinion on how they improve their sleep.Any advice or stories greatly appreciated.
I love tracking my sleep on my wrist  using my fitbit one.  It's rather accurate for me, however the sleep band is starting to smell like vinegar or glueish chemical  makes me want to get sick. Does anyone know if washing it will ruin it?  What about something else I can use to put the fit bit in while I sleep any suggestions?
Hello @adinasavescu, it's great to see you around!
 
Thank you very much for taking the time to provide your feedback and the information that you've shared! Looks like you've already opened some feature requests for this on our Feature Suggestions board, so, for now, we will leave these suggestions open for votes (and closed to comments) so that we can continue to track community demand over time. You can learn more about how Fitbit decides what suggestions get released in our FAQs.
 
For your suggestion to include the average REM, deep, light and awake times on the screenshot for duration, I'd like to let you know that if you swipe left on the Fitbit App (followed by the Sleep Schedule window) you will be able to see "Hours in Sleep Stages" you can click on the icon at the upper right corner next to this Title and you will be able to see the Average for REM, Light, Deep, No Stages. It can be seen per Week or Month. 
 
See you around.

Sleep sensitivity shouldn’t affect your step count, at least not in any major way. The best way to find out its impact is to turn it on for a couple of days, and compare the results with night tracked with the normal setting.

Dear community members,I have a question regarding to how the percentage of each sleep phase is calculated on Fitbit (% REM, % LIGHT, % DEEP). First I exported the sleep data to an excel spreadsheet. I extracted the amount of time I slept on the REM phase and divided it by the total time I was asleep, then I multiplied it by 100. To my surprise I saw that the percentage for the REM phase calculated by the Fitbit app wasn't the same as the one calculated by  me. I repeated the calculation, but this time I used the total time in bed. In this case there was a match between Fitbit and my calculation. Is this right? In order to obtain the percentage of time spent on REM/LIGHT/SLEEP during the sleep cycle, shouldn't we divide it by the total time asleep instead of the total time in bed? Looking forward for your answer, Tom
Not sure what value your comments provide but to clarify there is now a message in the sleep section of the app stating you need to subscribe to premium to see the sleep data..  This is not the same as occasionally not getting sleep data because of missed heart rate reading or sleep cycle too short.  I had a functionality that was advertised with the product I purchased and now that functionality is gone. So no conspiracy theories here.
Hello @Bartfliet. It's great to see you around! @SunsetRunner Nice to see you and thank you so much for your great input! 
 
I agree with @SunsetRunner. Fitbit Features and the metrics within these features are not intended to diagnose or treat any medical condition and should not be relied on for any medical purposes. It is intended to provide information that can help you manage your well-being. But if you have any concerns about your health, I recommend talking to a healthcare provider.

There is a way to do this, but you'll have to manually do it every morning. Click on the detailed stats for last night. At the top of your screen you'll see an option to share. You can either post the results on your FitBit profile, which everyone can see, or take a screen shot of the data so you can send the photo through texting/email.
Hi @Chinni86 Have you looked into a melatonin supplement?
@CarlaDawn wrote:We all know that’s the way it should be, so please don’t close this suggestion to comments. Hear us.I understand your point, but I don't know that "we all know that's the way it should be". Different people have different views. I have always heard questions such as, "did you sleep okay last night", and have never heard "did you sleep okay yesterday". So, I have always based my sleep status on the day I got up, not the day I went to bed.   Maybe a good solution would be if the app provided an option to select whether the user wants it based on the start time, or the end time.
Thanks to everyone who posted. I see that my pattern is definitely not good and I will see my GP about this. I also see mine is not the worst (31% sleep efficiency - I'd be dead in 3 days!). I have taken screenshots to print and show her.
@jfaes  Not all the Fitbits track stairs. The dashboard is the same for all devices. but not all Fitbits have the altimeter to recognize stairs. My Flex does not. Welcome to the forums.

Hey so I hav been notching my heart rate goes up to 159 to 170 while sleeping. I have no symptoms neither do I wake up in the middle and feel this but can this be a glitch. I havea charge 3
It just tracks and reports so you can see how you're doing and what, if anything, you need to pay more attention to.

you can use this help article  to answer most of your questions. I will say that a fitbit isn't a sleep device, although it gives sleep data. It also isn't a heart monitor, although it will give you your RHR. The items you mention seem to be a sleep study of sorts and I am not sure that is what Fitbit is designed for.

I'm glad I clicked on this topic. The first night I used my Fitbit and tracked my sleep, I spent 10 minutes in Deep Sleep. The night before last, I spent 1 hour and 10 minutes in Deep Sleep. I spend most of my time in Light Sleep, followed by REM Sleep. It baffles me. But I'm glad I'm not alone. I think one of the things I need to start doing is disconnecting from electronic devices a few hours before bed. It's very difficult but I'll have to wean myself from them earlier and earlier each night.
Looks like you’ve had your Fitbit for a couple of years. The sleep score feature was introduced last summer. Has it been working OK for you ever since? In other words, was last time the first time Fitbit failed to detect your sleep (and therefore calculate a score for it)? Was there anything special about last night? See what happens tonight, maybe last night was just an outlier. I’m not aware of any way to "fix" sleep after the fact.

I ordered the FITBIT and while waiting for it to come in, I got the "Sleep As Android" app. I was surprised by how well it works. I think it works better than FITBIT. At least it has a better user interface. I place my phone next to my pillow and it seems pretty accurate. I just pick it up and tell it to start logging.  In the morning, I tell it to stop logging.   BIG PLUS  "Sleep" even records the sounds (snoring, coughing,...) thru the night. I has an add-on app to store the logs in the cloud.
Thanks for the input! I chose "sensitive" tracking as opposed to "normal" because of how long it takes me to fall asleep -- because of the anxiety, I startle myself awake several times as I'm drifting off. I'm trying to improve my sleep habits, so I want to capture even the smallest movement for a week or two, to see if I can improve. Then I might switch to "normal" mode.
I wish I had the answer, I fall asleep no problem its staying asleep that's a challenge. But I am curious about something.. Do you fight thinking or do you just let it happen? You know when your mind is racing about whatever and you overlay that with why am I still awake, if I fall asleep now.. blah blah. If you let it go and just think without the background noise, do you think it will just lull itself to sleep? Almost like that's your brain's lullaby?

I tried sensitive last night. It didn't start any sooner and I got thickred lines.
I read for 30 minutes before i turn the lights out for the night. It helps me wind down. But when I check my sleep in the morning.....wait let me put an example. Let's say I go lay down in bed at 9pm (I read for 30 minutes), I turn lights off at 9:30. I would fell asleep soon after that (10pm) and I would wake up the next morning at 5:30am. so that would give me 7 1/2 hours of sleep. But why does my fitbit charge say that I slept 8 1/2 hours? I hope this makes sense. TIA
@kneppster, I'm glad to know that everything is now fine! 
 
Thanks for updating the Fitbit App. Note that you can post here in case you have any questions related or create a new thread for another topic.

When it comes to getting in bed on time, the most dangerous "device" in my house is a good book.  Said another way, getting up from in front of the comuter or the TV and heading for bed on time is no problem; putting down a good book is really-REALLY difficult.  Kinda like, "Okay, to the next scene change; no wait, to the end of this chapter.  Oh okay, one more chapter after that."
Here are my tips to you on how to get a good nights sleep.First off, set a schedule, or at least a goal as to when you're going to go to bed! Secondly exercise at least 30 minutes in the day a few hours before your set goal. Thirdly, and this is important, do not drink caffeine at least 4 hours before bed.Next, relax before bed, get in a sleepy mood. And then I suggest before or while you're in bed, listen to a calming song, or soundtrack. I suggest Marconi Union Weightless or Pandora by Hans Zimmer.Lastly, think calm thoughts as you drift off to sleep, i am a writer, so I have to describe something in order to fall asleep. Whether it's a Disney princess, an event, or even just an object, do it. It really helpsThanks guys. Hope this really helps. *Loser Girl

I rarely (maybe once every week or two) look at my sleep logs. The reason I wear my Charge HR at night is because of the silent alarm feature.  Honestly, it's one of my favorite features of the device.  Not only does it "gently" wake me up in the morning, it also doesn't wake up my wife. 😄 I have one set for 4:30 am, and a backup set for 4:35 am.... and just in case the battery dies overnight, I have an alarm on my phone set for 4:40 am.
I have a Versa that I've used for nearly four years of usually successful sleep stage tracking - rem, deep, etc. but with occasional hiccups where only simplified details are provided. I know by heart all the canned responses from Fitbit tech support about what to do when detailed sleep stage info doesn't appear and you get the dreaded "Your tracker couldn't get a consistent heart rate reading while you slept" message explaining why you only got simplified sleep datails.  I've tried every suggestion, and usually they work.  But now for two weeks no detailed sleep stages, and no heart rate variability details for the same period despite following all advice and personal experience with what makes sleep stage tracking work.  Versa otherwise performs flawlessly and heart rate registers on the watch face.   Full factory reset, reloaded the Fitbit app, ample battery charge, worn correctly, clean sensors, etc. etc.
Hi @Wulfdog, It's difficult to say, as normal for one person might look a little different than for another. For instance, in the three charts, there is an awake period around midnight each time. Is this normal? It may be for you. We're all a little different. If you look in the sleep charts in the android/iOS/Windows app (instead of the web dashboard you linked), you will see a tab called Benchmark. If you select that tab, it will compare you sleep patterns to others of your age and gender. That's as close to normal as we can see. Beyond that would probably need a sleep specialist to tell.

*yawn* Oh hey @CallieM, My sleep log (when I still used a Fitbit, and had it on Sensitive) looked a lot like that. 17 times awake23 times awake3:01 really asleep ^^ A lot of my sleep logs on sensitive looked like THAT  -Kai

I just started the free 3 month premium trial too and learned today, that if you click on the "Time Asleep" or "Deep and REM" or "restoration" that you will get the detail that you hav been missing.
I wear it on the left hand as well (non-dominate) and have it on the sensitive option - It seems more accurate for me.
I have been taking Olly Sleep Gummies. One serving has 3mg of Melatonin.  It seems to work well for me 🙂
Go back to settings and change to normal
Thank you for the suggestions! I'm going to try both of these on my flight. Thanks much 🙂 

Proud owner of the Alta and Aria.Have a book or blog to recommend?
Hoping my sleep score magically reappears soon too! I was so happy that my Charge 3 gave sleep scores when I got it a week ago... then after just 3 nights, it gave me only the basic awake / restless / asleep information. I was so disappointed!! But happy to see it wasn't just me having the issues. Good to know that some are coming back! 🙂
Same problem. Has anyone found a fix for this?
Unfortunately resetting my Fitbit didn't work.  It's still not tracking my sleep pattern.  Any other suggestions?  Thx.
Really. Now I know.Thanks.Sent from my iPhone
Welcome to the forums @rxnate! Quick question, do you use your phone before sleeping? I remember a post from @Gandhi where he mentioned that the blue light affects your sleep efficiency. How about reading before bed?

Welcome to the community @Nannette! I've seen this happening to other users and what I was able to find out is that the syncing process might take a few hours to update your sleep data. Can you confirm if this is the case? Do you see your correct sleep hours from that day on your Dashboard now?
 
Looking forward to your reply.

Melissa | Community Moderator, FitbitHow are you fitbitting with your (pet) best friend? Show us!
Are you wearing it a bit to loose or to tight? Personally wear so have a finger space between the tracker and the wrist.
Well, obviously regulating your resting HR (whether during daytime or at night) isn’t something that can be done consciously, but I’m trying to see if there are patterns that can be identified. Just like I now know my daytime RHR tends to elevate with stress. One thing that seem to have an effect is the number of trips to the bathroom I’m taking, so I try to cut intake of liquid early enough in the afternoon.

Hrm.. created a duplicate with no way to delete. Interesting... Oh, well. Just ignore this message! LOL 😄
This is not the detailed sleep chart. One look like this. Notice that I do not have that much deep sleep (a bit over an hour this night) but this is normal. To get this you need to go to bed without manually going in Sleep mode in the app. When you were going to bed, were you setting your app to Sleep mode ? In addition, it seems you are really restless. Either something is up with your tracker or you do not sleep very well.
According to that quiz I'm a mess lol
Hello, I only got my fit bit last week, the first night I wore it to sleep I awoke to my sleep score and also the stages of REM, Light, Deep etc. Ever since I haven’t got a score or the stages? I just get “asleep” “restless”. I have tried finding settings to change this and there is nothing, I have googled, I tried making the band tighter to make sure the watch isn’t slipping. I just cannot work out why this feature has stopped working 😞 I really struggle with sleep so this feature was a huge factor in why I chose this watch so I really would like to get it working. Any help appreciated, thank you.
I have put the Flex to sensitive, however when looking at the stats next day, most times it says that I fall a sleep instantly though I have been lying awake for a couple of hours and waking up at night says only restless, eventhough I have tried to wave my arm a lot just to test. This makes it little trustworthy and not to much use, unless I do something wrong.
This is an important metric for me. I am trying to do more cardio activities to improve my resting bpm. But it fluctuates quite a bit. I believe a healthy diet can help as well. I also look forward to suggestions from others. Thank you, Eric
The one you prefer is the one with sleep stages.There are various reasons why it might not be able to detect sleep stages some night.See Why don't I see sleep stages today?  and the other surrounding help sections for more about sleep tracking.

Hello everyone. 😊
 
A new week has just started with many new opportunities 🤗 and I hope you all had a great weekend. Specially, I hope you had enough time to rest after a hard week. 
 
Do you guys think that weather change can affect the way we sleep? I personally have a hard time getting a good night's sleep on warm nights. But what I actually do is to try a warm bath or shower before going to bed. After getting out of the warm water, our bodies temperature will naturally drop, which will help facilitate sleep.
 
Wearing cooler clothes in the hottest months is another helpful tip. Putting a slumber gel pad on our mattress can further reduce heat. A ceiling fan above our bed can create an additional chill effect. What about you? What do you usually do in this situation? 
 

 
On the opposite side, winter cold can bring Insomnia. This is not something that I experience, but the colder months of winter create a different scenario that can affect sleep. Seems that less sunlight in the winter can trigger mood disorders, which in turn, can lead to insomnia. When you don't get enough sunlight, your brain does not produce enough melatonin from serotonin, which are the chemicals in your brain that help produce a good night's sleep.
Fortunately, there are some tips. So, it's it's best to get some outdoor exercise during the day for at least a half hour, unless it's raining or snowing. Activities can range from walking to skiing. By getting outside in the morning, you can boost your melatonin levels, which will help both your mood and your ability to go to sleep at night. You should also stay away from substances that block melatonin production, such as caffeine, alcohol, chocolate or certain pharma drugs.
 
In addition, certain fruits boost melatonin levels more effectively. Pineapple, bananas and oranges are some of the most powerful fruits that can significantly raise melatonin. Supplements, however, are a weak substitute for real fruit. Other foods that can boost melatonin levels include oats, rice, tomatoes and barley.
 

 
If you have some tips about how you usually manage this, please share them here in this thread. I promise I'll take the time to read your experiences 😁
 
See you around.

Anyone know how to revert to the sleep averages vs the score? I hate the “sleep score.” But used the sleep average DAILY. Fitbit how do we change this? Please make it customizable. I created an account on this forum to figure it out. That’s how much I want it changed!!
Well, I don't know.  Perhaps your app need updating?  You could contact tech support also.  Sorry I can't be more help!
I would be interested in answers myself. I fall asleep easy but then it's like my second life starts and I dream constantly. If I could shut the dreams off I'd get better sleep I'm sure.
My son has a Garmin. I have a Fitbit Alta. We decided to switch last night to see how our sleeping scores changed.I had a very bad night, like every night, I couldn't sleep. The Garmin tracked me at 10 hours in bed, 4 hours light sleep, 2 hours deep sleep, the rest, awake. It doesn't have an option to change the sleep sensitivity.My Fitbit has similar results in the "sensitive" mode. In the "normal" mode it has me getting 8 hours of quality sleep with no light blue bands. Some night in which I know I didn't sleep at all, on the sensitive setting the Fitbit has my sleep at 5 hours, but on nights where I know I had nice long stretches of restful sleep, it may have me logged as little as 3 hours of sleep.I am so confused by all of this. I have become a little obsessed. I don't know which setting to use. I'm tired and miserable, and I'm hoping to get a little help. Thank you.When I use
Same question here. We always read about getting at least 7 hours of sleep, but this metric came before we had the advanced data we now have with our Fitbit trackers. I think this is an area that sleep scientists need to weigh in on.
I just got mine for Christmas and was told this was the way to do it. Try checking in the profile and set the sleep from normal to sensitive. Hope this helps.
Yes. It is weird that a watch has helped me sleep, but it has. It has helped me understand what time I end up falling asleep, so I can work on it the next week.
Hi Fitbit sleepers! I'm considering getting a new mattress, to help enhance sleep, and don't really know the best way to go about finding a mattress that will work.  It seems like going to a store and just laying on a mattress for a couple of minutes isn't going to tell me what spending a night on it is like. Any tips on choosing the right mattress? I have a pre-existing back issue, and have always preferred more firm support. Currently, I use a very firm foam mattress with a mattress topper for a little more softness. It just dawned on me how much effort and money we spend on choosing cars. Considering how much time we spend in bed vs. in a car, I'd like to upgrade my sleep situation. Any feedback or tips appreciated.

try wearing a sweatband over your tracker . . dormez bien !
i signed up for the one week trial on the premium membership and i am wondering if the histograms shown there are based on (1) all users (2) normal mode users or (3) sensitive mode users.  does anyone know?  it seems like fitbit could easily parse this data out to display different histograms (hint, hint, are you listening?).  thanks.
@eezeepee The purpose of this section is to discuss issues, solve problems, helps each other.Your topic better suits this section
By looking at my pattern of sleep over a couple of weeks I noticed if I ate close to bedtime I fell asleep quickly, but remained restless for an hour or more.  No food for a few hours resulted in me falling into more rested sleep  (an extra hour of quality sleep a night is a full nights sleep a week!).
I replaced mine with a banjee wrist wallet from sprigs. sprigs.com/banjees

My expectation for basic logic and addition is not " widly overblown."My expetation that 4 + 3 = 7 hours daily total and NOT 4 + 3 = 4 hours daily total is not "wildly overblown." This is in regards to the $130 Fitbit Force, which has similar function to the Jawbone "Up" that also tracks sleep.  Some of you on here don't seem to be familiar how it works, but sleep records are manually tracked though the stop watch feature.  You press it when you go to sleep, and press it again when you wake up.  Then you can edit it on the website.  I would expect if I am manually entering the time of an activity, that it would add that time for the day in my sleep reports and in the numer it uses to calculate my average sleep time that week.  This is deceptive and ridiculous that it would just disregard any time there is more than one record per day.
It seems sleep score (new feature) is being rolled out to users: some already have it, others don’t. See this other topic about sleep score. My guess is you belong to the first category, and sleep score has replaced the weekly average. I belong to the second category: I’m not getting any sleep score yet, but I still see the weekly averages.

Hi @Proartwork  Yes, the new dashboard is slightly different. You'll see a sleep score, too. Your images didn't show up. To post images, you need to upload them to Fitbit.

Thanks for your help.
Thanks for your response, awood.  I have a fitbit-one. After using the sleep tracker now for a few days, I understand what you mean.  If you don't signal that you are awake in the morning, it might think that even though you are sitting and reading, you are still asleep and log extra time for sleeping.  That's what just happened to me.  So I edited the awake time.  I think the tracker works best it you can tell it when you believe you ready to fall asleep and when you just wake up. What is working for me is to keep my own manual log and guess about all the awake and sleep times for the night before, then check what fitbit has recorded.  Using both my own memory and fitbit's graph gives me what I believe is the most accurate valuable information.
The newly updated graphs have now removed my ability to read how long i was actually asleep between restless periods.
Pulse oximetry is a standard monitoring device in intensive care units ICUs, currently used to guide therapeutic interventions. Few studies have evaluated the accuracy of SPO in critically ill patients. Our objective was to compare pulse oximetry with arterial oxygen saturation SAO2 in such patients, and to examine the effect of several factors on this relationship.
When my Fitbit "goes", I'm not upgrading or replacing it. After all, thecompany may, again, switch the information display.The main reason I have or use my Fitbit is to track my sleep; there areother devices to choose from; I'll go elsewhere.

Hi @Rcastle Welcome to the forum. May I ask what type of Fitbit you have? I find sleep tracking to more accurate if you are using a tracking with HR monitor. A trick I have found too, if I don't think my sleep data is accurate, for example I got up during the night and it didn't register that I went back to sleep, I delete the data and manually log the start and end time and then the rest of the data will fill in, showing me a more accurate representation of my sleep. I hope that helps.

You might try one of the Guided Programs for sleep; on phone app, tap 'Discover' at bottom, then 'Guided Programs'.  I think there are a couple at least about sleep habits or getting more sleep.

My sleep cycle appears similar, going into deep sleep soon after falling asleep. I am retired and wait until I am very tired before going to bed, staying up until midnigh or later. I then sleep a solid 7 or 8 hours.
I synced my Fitbit Wednesday and upon trying to login discovered Fitbit was down or something - it simply wasn't possible to login that day. I'm having the same issue today, but come to conclude that Fitbit and Google Chrome aren't playing nice so using IE11 to post this message instead. While my Wednesday sync uploaded most of my data, my sleep info appears to be missing and I'm a tad confused. I have a start time, an end time, and 0 mins recorded. Did the server break that day or something? It's not that I was awake for 8 hours or anything - there is absolutely no info on the sleep page, no line graph, no sleep stage percentages, nothing! Can anyone explain what's going on with Fitbit? Thanks.

Mine does the same thing but if i turn down to normal sensitivity it doesnt tell me that I sleep at all.  I never had any issues with the surge just the blaze.
Oh, I tried that.  It was horribly uncomfortable.  If they're cheap and you can return them, it's worth a shot, especially since there's far more of a range available these days and you may find better ones than I used.  Then you can see whether it's worth the cost of getting a new pair of glasses made up.  I ended up writing a website about my experiences with it all.
My sleep tracker doesn`t seem to be working right. It says I am only sleeping 3 hours a night. Any thoughts?
@IzzyA415wrote:To wake up quicker, wear long pants and a shirt to bed instead of just an over sized tee. This is because the heat is equal through out the body. Your more likely to wake up in the morning instead of stay under the "warm, cozy covers".  I've been late numerous times simply because it was too cold to get out of bed. Also do something like yoga or meditation in the morning so you look forward to waking up.Interesting, My experience is almost the opposite. If I wake up on the cold side in bed, I feel fine getting up. It's when I'm nested in a warm bed that I have trouble getting up. But we're all different.

nowhere near as good as the huawei band 3 pro which has a sleep score and gives you guidance on which parts of sleep you should improve on and how
My fitbit has given me insights into how I sleep. I never realized how often I wake up during the night. It can sense when a person is not sleeping, sleeping or gets up. Then it calculates all these variables and comes up with how many hours an individual sleeps.I realize that I average around 5 1/2 hours each night. I am unable to get a good nights rest, due to my work schedule and family life. I hope my answer helps.

I just purchased a new Fitbit Charge three and I am so disappointed. My charge 2 seemed totrack everything accurately including naps. The three doesn’t track naps and I can make one trip upstairs and it will show 40. Very dissatisfied. I miss my 2.
There used to be a function that would wake you up in your UP cycle if it was between certain minutes of your alarm setting. I can't find that feature anymore
I’m having the same issue! Won’t track exercise or any scores !
Thank you! But is there a way to make it stop doing it altogether? He doesn't want to do that every day. Lol
I woke up today with a below range oxygenation score and got a migraine later in the day. Has anyone else noticed a correlation between oxygenation rates and migraines?
By switching from "sensitive" to "normal" sleep mode, I have doubled my sleep time! Just what is Fit Bit measuring as "sleep" anyway?  I used to think I was a pretty good sleeper, until I got my Flex late last year. Suddenly, I had data that showed I slept on average 4 1/2 hours a night. Wow, I must be exhausted. I started reading about ways to improve my sleep habits and tried most of them. Nothing moved the Flex sleep numbers. Finally, I ended up with a doctor who sees the "data" and prescribes sleeping pills for the "problem." Before heading down the rabbit hole of sleeping meds, I decided to check the Flex setting and found that I was using "sensitive."  By changing the setting to "normal" (and no other changes), I went from consistently sleeping 4 1/2 hrs a night to 8 1/2 hrs a night. The "problem" was solved. I am pissed at being tortured with a problem I didn't have for eight months, but learned some good lessons: (1) listen to my body, not just the data; (2) understand how sleep attitude, physiology, and environment work; (3) check your Fit Bit settings; and (4) use Fit Bit for "comparative sleep" data, not "real sleep" data. z-z-z-z-z-z

I think for many of us, when we think of sleep disordered breathing, sleep apnea comes to mind. But what about upper airway resistance syndrome? UARS is another sleep disordered breathing condition but with some key differences as compared to sleep apnea. Instead of having an apnea and then arousal, with UARS the person briefly wakes up after not being able to breath well. So, it's considered to be between normal sleep and sleep apnea. The risk factors for UARS are also very different, and there can be a stark contrast in the profile of someone with the two conditions.  From what I've read, a lot of testing done for sleep apnea will miss UARS due to the differences how the two conditions manifest themselves in sleep. It seems to me that many people with sleep issues could have actually have UARS, as this condition results in fatigue and unrefreshing sleep. Just something to consider if you think you might have sleep apnea. Links:http://doctorstevenpark.com/tired-of-being-tired-%E2%80%94-the-upper-airway-resistance-syndromehttps://www.sleepassociation.org/upper-airway-resistance-syndrome/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4881892/
Have found the sleep analysis quite useful. The odd time my heart rate was not detected and the sleep detected was less than 3 hours so no detailed results. Last night sleep was tracked for almost 8 hours with awake time and restless time noted but no other analysis. Heart rate detection appears to be normal. Have I changed something or is there some other explanation
Had my Fit bit for 2 months now and very pleased with it.  One of the main reasons for getting it was due to sleep problems, it proved to me that even though I rarely get 8 hours I was getting much more than I thought which has meant that I am not anxious about it anymore. However over the last week I have noticed that when I get up to use the loo in the night it seems to stop recording my sleep when I know for sure I have fallen asleep again.  As an example, last night, got to bed around 11.30, got up to go to the loo around 4.30, and know I went straight back to sleep until 7.00 but recorded me as waking at 4.30, any ideas anybody?
I have the Charge 2 and had a history of insomnia. I began to go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier and it's still a struggle. I enjoy looking at my sleeping data once I wake up but I am a bit curious as to what "restlessness" entails. Like movements? Etc?Thank you in advance!

As people have said before, lower the sensitivity of your tracker for your sleep settings. I highly doubt that you were actually restless for nearly 5 hours of your sleep. Unless you wake up tired more than usual (if you even are tired when you wake up) then you are probably getting better rest than what your tracker says.

If you have the "Sleep Statistic" enabled in the app on your phone you can click on it, from there click on the night where you want to see your awake time and scroll abit down to see the time near the red point called "Awake" if this translation fits from Dutch. If the "Sleep Statistic" does not show in the overview of the app then hit the Edit button in the top right near today scroll down and add sleep to the statistics then repeat from the biginning.

I’m new to Fitbit, and just curious about the sleep log. I need to get up at night most nights to pee. Do I “wake up” then add another sleep session? Or do I leave the setting in sleep mode until I wake up for the day. I was searching but didn’t find the information online. Maybe I wasn’t looking in the right place?

The same thing began happening to mine a few nights ago. I now get basic sleep details only, without the stages and comparisons. I receive the message, "Your tracker couldn't get a consistent heart-rate reading while you slept." Should I worry about my heart or this gadget?  I've found that the slightest vibration like a soft touch on the band will turn the pulse off. This began soon after I replaced the classic band with a new classic band after the original broke. I don't know if this is involved in the problem. The fitbit hasn't been dropped or damaged in any way, but it sat idle for several days while I waited for the new band to arrive. Maybe it felt unloved! Anyway, after only one year, this is the first malfunction.
Great advice. I didn't realize that carbs at night dud that to you. ThxSent from my iPhone
I only slept 4 hours last night. Why would that earn a 71/Fair score?
Hi, folks. Since the 5th of this month, I've been downloading my FitBit (Flex) data into a spreadsheet using an automated script so I can further analyze my sleep data. Using sensitive mode on my non-dominant hand, I average 13 periods of restlessness/awakenings per night, and average 4.5 hours of sleep per night. I've been reading here and there questions regarding FitBit's accuracy, and so I decided to compare graphs between it and Sleep As Android (app). Here's my results for one night in comparison:  Except for the activity shown in the first hour of the Sleep As Android graph, the rest appears consistent.  If anything this gives me more confidence in the device and reinforces my thought that I should take the results to my physician and undergo a sleep study. I'm curious if anyone else has made similar comparisons and if they were or were not consistent. Cheers.
Ladies and Gentlemen (and @Dominique and @SunsetRunner )-- this is a continuation of a Keto thread in the Eat Well forum.  I've been eating Keto for about 6 months and have found that my sleep patterns have changed, and are consistent with reports of others who eat Keto.  Here's my chronology:5 years ago - snored frequently and my wife starting sleeping with earplugs.  Sleep quality still pretty good2 years ago - kept waking up tired, was diagnosed with sleep apnea, started using CPAP machine, sleep quality improved9 months ago - lost weight (low carb but not Keto), stopped snoring, stopped using CPAP machine, my wife no longer needs earplugs.  Sleep quality good, 8+ hours per night6 months ago - started Keto, sleep patterns changedWhen IN ketosis: light sleep, frequent waking, 6 hours required, quickly alert upon rising.When OUT of ketosis: heavy sleep, sleep through night, 8 hours required, groggier upon rising.(I am strongly in ketosis about 4 days per week) I've seen that many people who eat Keto report experiencing insomnia, and there are a number of articles and YouTube videos on the topic.  I don't experience my light sleep as insomnia; I rather enjoy drifting in and out of sleep knowing I will rise fully energized one hour before the alarm clock. Here is a theory as to why you need less sleep when eating Keto: we need sleep primarily to recharge our brains and neurology (with a sedentary lifestyle, we certainly don't need to recharge our muscles).  When we sleep, 85% of our energy is consumed by our brains, and dreaming is evidence of the processing of short-term memories into long-term (outside the scope of this post).  As anyone who has experienced ketosis can attest, ketosis provides for a higher and more consistent level of fuel and energy to the brain.  Therefore, you arrive at the end of the day less mentally fatigued and during sleep you refuel energy to your brain at a higher rate.  The net result is you need less sleep to recharge. I've never had a problem falling asleep even if I drink coffee in the evening; however, consuming MCT Oil after 6:00 PM makes for a very short night of sleep.  Last time I did it, I got up at 3:00 AM.  This is consistent with the idea that MCT Oil is more readily metabolized as "brain fuel" (outside the scope of this post). Long dissertation of a post -- if you eat KETO, has your sleep been disrupted, and have you found it to be a benefit or drawback?

@Labinopper thanks so much for coming to the Community and posting your question - we are glad to see you here! 
 
When Fitbit users have sleep logs that look very similar to yours, we usually suggest that they go into their device settings to make sure their settings are on "Normal" not "Sensitive." Almost all of our users fall into the "Normal" category. Here's how to ensure that you have the Normal setting:
 
Go to fitbit.com, login, and click the gear icon in the upper right hand of the page. Click on your tracker. When on the Settings page, click on the tracker you wear to sleep.

 
Scroll down to the section called "Sleep Tracking" and if it's set to Sensitive, change it to Normal. Make sure to sync so that your tracker remembers this new setting!

 
Let me know if you have any questions, if it helps, or if it doesn't!

I just had a sleep study and have plms or periodic limb movement syndrome, which I think is much like restless leg syndrome.I weened myself off of klonapin almost two years ago so don't want that again. Not sure I trust medication. I see parkinson meds or benzos are the "go to" meds for this...I am all about natural ideas such as moderate exercise, warm baths, and massage. I saw something re using e-stim too. Has anyone tried that? I am open to trying flavored tonic water too as someone here suggests If that works.

Ive been wearing the Charge 4 since June 1st (was wearing inspire HR before). Twice now I noticed it did not detect sleep (when yes i do know I was sleeping) for example on one day it said I did not get to sleep until 4am and last night it said I did not get to sleep until 2:20am when I know for certain I crashed hard at  around 11pm, could not get through a page of my book! Additionally, it said my wake time was 7:35 but I was “awake” according to the app from 7:08 to 7:35. Why wouldn’t it just say my wake time was 7:08? Now it just ads 30 minutes to the awake time percentage making it highly inaccurate. This latter issue happens all the time, adding awake time to my sleep stats rather than just saying my wake time was earlier.  Any thoughts on why this would be?
I was diagnosed with extreme sleep apnea, I was always tired, no energy. My Dr. referred me to an over night sleep diagnostic center. I was given a prescription for a bi-pap machine. It took a lot for me to get used to wearing the mask and using the machine. I got so frustrated I quit using it. Untreated severe sleep apnea can cause increased chance of heart attack or stroke. Another symptom I had was I fell asleep at a red light. Yikes! A sleep technician gave me tips on getting used to my mask and machine. The first time I slept using the bi-pap for around 6 hrs. straight was amazing. I felt fabulous. I now use it every night and can't even tell if the machine is on. If you're having a hard time using c-pap or bi-pap there's plenty of great tutorials on YouTube. One quick tip, wear your mask and turn your machine on while you watch tv for about 10 min. Try doing that a bit. It becomes easier and well worth it. Losing weight also helps. A lot.
 
Hey @WilsonFitbit, I forgot 2 other symptoms I had. One was constant headaches, I would wake up with a headache. The other was having to urinate 5 or 6 times a night while trying to sleep. It really sucked. Both of these symptoms went away when I got used to using my machine for at least 5 hours a night. Peace

There's a whole thread on adding the feature back to track this.   It was a feature of earlier fitbit app software on android/ios to allow you to manually add the info to track this.  Their case for removing it makes no sense to most of us.   A feature to allow you to sync with other blood pressure measuring devices has also been requested.   They never made it clear what the results were of a study they did to have some fitbit devices measure this (PAT study)
Just bought a Sense a week ago. For 5 nights I was able to see my sleep score and sleep stages but for the last 2 nights there wasn't a score or stage breakdown. I searched for an answer and found I'm not the only one to experience this. I called the help desk, logged in and out, reset my devices , tightened the strap when I sleep...nothing. I have the Premium trial but If I can't find an answer I will cancel and return the watch.
@SnapperUK I dont know the answer to your question either, but I think we are all different. The 'recommended' amounts needed are just averages. As long as you are feeling that you slept well I dont think it matters. I seem to get less deep sleep than the recommendation but I feel absolutely fine unless I have a very poor nights sleep in general (ie only about 6 or less hours) so I am not particularly concerned about it.

Hello @Bowleytraveler and welcome to the Community.  Deep and REM sleep times vary by age.  A good place to start is to look at your sleep Benchmarks.  Tap on your Sleep tile and look for the toggle below your sleep stages graph and set it to Benchmark.  You can see what is typical for your age. Fitbit has a Guided Program called Habits for Restful Sleep.  It's a 2 week program that is free to all users.  Tap on your Discover icon, then scroll down to Guided Programs to find it.  It might give you some insights if your sleep differs from your benchmark. I'm also moving your post to the Sleep Well forum.  It's a better fit for your question.

Jenarob10, I do not believe that the added feature was available before.  I signed up for the free trial of the Premium and think I will continue to pay for it as it shows more information about my sleep tracking which I find beneficial.But, definitely, if you do not see any benefit to the additonal premium feature(s), do not pay for them.
I'm also having this issue, do you know when the update happened? My sleep hasn't been logged since 19th April.
I see, that a completely different issue indeed, sorry for the misunderstanding. Unfortunately, I don't think I have anything to offer as a solution, never seen this one before. I would suggest you drop Support and email and see what they say. Have a nice day.

They do I hope that I will be able to achieve a better balance. I haven't had my fitbit long and so far I haven't had a night where I perceive myself as dreaming really heavily, I am curious to see if on the nights I perceive myself to be dreaming heavily if I am actually getting more REM. I am a writer and I have trouble turning off my creative brain if I haven't really given myself time to create in the day, I end up all night asleep but still busy in my dreams. I have lucid dreams that I can control and it just gets to be a tremendous amount of work sometimes dreaming lol

I would check your account settings and make sure your sleep sensitivity is set to normal. I had mine set to sensitive and it looked similar to this.
It fixed itself. It is showing now. That is really odd.  Thank you!
I was wondering the same, the only thing I can think of is when it thinks I might have woken a bit or moved in my sleep.
I've had some pretty good nights of sleep lately.  Ranging from 81 to 91 this last week.

Hi there,It was tracking but I could not see REM stages however I realized that I just needed to make sure that I turned on the heart monitor not having it on auto.Thanks Otila
YES!I use it to remind me to take meds and for my wake up call. However the more alarms you set the faster your battery will rundown. So I keep two alarms set all the time. They are most helpful.

Indeed when I use the cpap I get lower overall sleep scores all around (most of the time) and it does impact my deep and REM (seems to be less of both).  Appreciate your feedback even late the more replies we can get the better our sample.  Cheers.
Hi, that's a great question! I've had a few instances where I've woken up during REM sleep, and it's very fascinating. In those moments, I did notice that my dreams were incredibly vivid and detailed, as if I was in another world. It's almost as if I was a character in my own movie. Sometimes I was even able to realize that I was dreaming, which is the first step to achieving lucid dreaming. It's a surreal experience that opens up exciting possibilities for exploring and controlling dreams. I also replaced my windows with noise-reducing ones here.
I don't know the timing, but is your firmware up to date?  My current version is: Firmware version: 22.22.53.4 Although I don't think you need to update, that might help.

For the past several nights I have been getting less sleep (6 to 7 hours). However my Sleep Quality seems to be better than at 8 hours. I have more REM and deep sleep and less awake time. What is the explanation for this?
Could you have had intermittent short episodes of being logged "awake" and could that be subtracted from your nine hours? This would be my guess.
I have rebooted the Fitbit. I make sure it has a charge. Some nights it only records 3-4 hours of sleep/stats and then reports nothing for the rest of the nightSome nights it will give a full night's stats. I go to bed between 8:30 and 9 and wake up at 6 every single day. So, I don't think it's an inconsistency on the data time available.Thank you,Mary

First of all, that's all the definition they have given me. I'm waiting for the next answer myself.Then about finding me, I'm not sure can you find it, because fitbit support isn't following me yet. So I'm not sure are those conversations public?I have posted our conversation of its best parts here, they have only thanked me for the first question.After that I've just gotten critical, of which they haven't replied.
@olledejong   There are a lot of old posts available, despite the fact that they are completely irrelevant.  Your sleep score is based on three things: Time Asleep, Deep and REM sleep, and  Restoration (a component that looks at your sleeping heart rate and restlessness).  The Time Asleep, that component that uses the time in bed and time asleep, accounts for only 50% of your sleep score. Any reference to Sleep Efficiency is out of date.

@Drewmoo12 - Since you are having breathing troubles, I strongly recommend contacting your doctor ASAP. Breathing issues can be related to Covid.
Without having read your description, I wouldn't see any concern with your sleep logs. I do note a couple of nights when you got low scores, that is actually because the log was broken in two, giving you two shorter logs as if you had a longer wake period during the night, not necessarily a problem or possible a misreading.  In either case, if considered together, it would have given you a decent score.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Dear Illusive Sleep,Where are you??  You never come to visit me anymore, and when you actually DO come around, you never stay long.  You leave me wanting and needing more of you. I am so exhausted. It seems like it would be so natural for you to stay with me all night long, and maybe even into the morning because of how badly I need you. If I can be really honest, I would even love to have you drop by for a nap or two. Please consider this an open invitation.  I miss you so much.  I need you. My life is falling apart without you.  Everything is worse, everything is harder, nothing is quite right without you.  Please come back to me.  Please come and stay a while.... a LONG while.Signed,Exhausted, Severely Sleep Deprived, and Lost Without You

Hi  I have looked at my sleep data for about a month now and could never seem to get it to move from 55-60%. So I done a little research and found all the daunting articles about sleep disorders etc. So over the past few weeks I have been making little changes to see if anything helps. Luckily I have found my problem which believe it or not is actualy to do with technology. when in starts to get dark the body starts to produce the sleeping hormone melatonin unfortunately due to the tv being on in the evening and the lights getting switched on at dusk, looking at your mobile, playing a computer or even working on a laptop at night all delay the hormone production. However the little change i tried is simply leaving the room as dark as possible or just puting a lamp on and restricting the use of my phone this has caused an increase to 91% in just a few  days. I also found another solution which is orange lense glasses, they stop the uv light from penetrating into the eye which big help ( haven't tried this yet as my efficiency has risen) Hope this help and may be worth a try before visiting a doctor and getting yourself all panicked
Hi everybody, does anybody use the app VirtualPartner on a Versa and uses GPS of an iPhone X? Somebody wrote me that there are problems with GPS. Has anybody have experiences with that combination? ThanksCapitano
I'm having issues viewing my sleep tracking. I sleep with my versa2 on but I am unable to see my history. When I wake up, it shows blank for my nights rest

@mar383 Hello and welcome!  Unfortunately, what you're asking is not possible.  You can only select one single time asleep goal (mine is 7 hours).  You'll be "rewarded" with a star on your sleep log for anything over your goal, but it's simply virtual and the "reward" basically has no meaning.  Fitbit is simply telling you that you slept a long time and exceeded your sleep goal. It's just a recording. I'm not sure what is possible for you, but perhaps setting an alarm for 8 hours after bedtime so you don't oversleep might help?

I keep finding issues with the automated sleep.  Please bring back the manual button!  -The new issue is if you are not active before bed, it can count as sleep.  I started reading a book at like 9:30 in a chair, got up to go to bed at 10:49.  It said I was asleep at 10:04!-The amount of time awake still doesn't agree between the mobile app and website.  It does most of the time but not all the time.  Makes me doubt any of it.  The _times_ awake agree just not the duration.-If I get up to go to the bathroom, unless I hurry, it creates a second sleep record. -When it creates two sleep records for one night, if the first ends before midnight, it puts it on the previous night's sleep, interferring with that record, leaving the 2nd record all alone for the current day. I'm spending more time fixing records that any push of a button could save time-wise.  Please fix the problems or give us back the button!  Thanks.
Welcome to the Fitbit Community forums @miguelans! Thanks for making your question about another tracker for child sleep. As @Odyssey13 kindly mentioned the Ace and Ace 2 are the only trackers for kids and the Ace 2 is the only one that records theirs sleep. I understand your needs, but because of your son's age the only tracker with a suitable sleep algorithm) is the Ace 2. You can lean more about it by checking the article: How do I get started with Fitbit kids devices?

Fitbit can detect naps, provided they’re long enough (see this article: Naps at least an hour in length will be automatically detected by your device and stored in your sleep history). What Fitbit cannot do is consolidate naps with the sleep that occured on the same night. However, I’m not aware that it substracts naps from the main sleep period, as you are saying. Here is an example from broken sleep that occured following a long intercontinental flight and the jetlag that resulted from it:  I was able to get about one hour of sleep at 10.13pm (considered as a nap), then slightly under two hours at 00.36 (also considered as a nap), and finally about three hours at 4:01am (considered sleep, with sleep stages, score and all). Naps weren’t added to the sleep period, but they weren’t substracted either. However short it was, the sleep period was rated on its own merits. Sometimes, if/when your sleep is all over the place, Fitbit may not be able to detect sleep stages, even if your sleep was long enough. Maybe this is what happened in your case. It looks like you’ve only been using your Fitbit for a week or so. You should probably use it for a while before deciding its sleep feature is buggy.

The mind is a powerful thing, and capable of playing many tricks on us.   You can try sleeping with a dead FB, but if you KNOW it's dead, that may well affect your experiment's results.  If you're really interested in finding out the truth, you'd have to find someway to use a placebo.  I don't know if it's possible to access your FB via computer, and turn it off, but if so, and you have a family member around, you could try that.   But it really comes down to what works for you in this instance.
Whoa! That's not good. I don't think I've had more than 20 times restless, with once or twice awake (and more often than not, it's a call of nature in the middle of the night).  I think what might help me is I often do a bit of light yoga at night.
I think the question really is, does anyone every actually achieve it? Have you?
What do you do immediately before you get into bed?  Are you using your computer or mobile phone or even watching TV in the evening before you head to bed, like me?  If you are, make use of the nightlight feature on your computer to significantly reduce the amount of light that's coming out of the screen for a couple of hours before bedtime and if possible, turn your mobile phone off for an hour or so before you go to bed too.  Experiment with things that make you tired... I do sit-ups, leg raises and planks, then listen to the radio and read a gentle magasine for half an hour or so, which works 97% of the time for me.  Give each new thing you try a week or so of attempts every night before you reject the idea completely. I've found that walking our dog twice during the day wipes me out and keeps me asleep for longer too... is there anything like that you could try too? Ideally there should be no technology use at all for at least 2 hours before bedtime, but I realise we don't live in an ideal world  😉 Also, try to stay awake during the day, no matter how little sleep you got, otherwise you won't feel tired enough to sleep that night and the troubles will start again - BTDT myself  😉 What sort of things do you do at the gym and when do you go - morning?  Afternoon?  Evening?  How do you feel (other than totally wiped out) when you've finished your gym session?  Do you feel tired or wide awake?  If it makes you feel sleepy, is there any way you can go to the gym just before they close?  If you feel wide awake, maybe you could try going as soon as they open for the day? Take things gradually and only change one thing at a time for a week or more at any time  🙂

I have recently noticed that alcohol has quite an effect on my Sleeping Heart Rate(SHR).  Over a period of a month or so, I have compared my SHR after drinking with the nights I do not drink.  If I drink with my evening meal I consume about a half bottle of red wine.The pattern without drinking shows the SHR sinking below Resting Heart Rate and staying there most of the night, which I understand to be the normal situation. In the case after drinking the SHR shoots up 15-20% above the Resting Heart Rate after retiring and remains elevated most of the night, although declining steadily after an hour or two of sleep.I don't know if there is anything problematic about this situation or not, but would be interested to hear if other shave observed the same phenomenon.
Thank you for the information.

My concern is that my Oxygen Saturation reading on my Fitbit Versa shows a range of 78% to 92% for last night???  It is ALWAYS between 89 and 93% which is too low.  Correct?  How accurate is it?  Thanks
@SSundar   I don't think Fitbit looks at that to calculate your Restoration score.  The way I read it, it only looks at the percentage of time it was below your RHR.  Fitbit uses age related data for your breakdown of your deep, REM, and light sleep.  There is benchmark data for that.  I don't think the data you are seeking exists.  Other factors, like room temperature, can affect your sleeping heart rate. Most sleep experts recommend avoiding alcohol if you want better sleep.  How does alcohol affect sleep? It's worse than you think

My Charge 2 did not record any sleep last night.
Well, i have a very adorable lovely dog, But i don't share the same bed with my dog, Because my dog has it's own bed.
A while ago I used to sleep poorly and had nightmares on a regular basis due to my anxiety. I never tried meditation myself before bed, but it might be something to try for you before going to sleep. For me things improved a lot with yoga (you could also do 5 mins of yoga before bed). Try to have as little input for your brain as possible quite some time before bed so it is not active/hyper while asleep. Do you have a routine for going to bed? If you do that it becomes a signal for your brain that it can start to calm down. I mostly had nightmares after an intense day and my brain being active on the subconscious level. Meditation can help you process that before going to sleep. This can be a hard one to tackle, so be patient with yourself. These are just a few ideas based on what I remember from my own experience, hope it helps.

I have seen this too.  I routinely trim "awake" time at the end... when I'm just lazing in bed or cuddling, I don't want to reflect either way in my sleep score.  Generally when I cut this time out it raises my sleep score, but occasionally it lowers it, even when I'm only removing awake time.  One day last week doing this resulted in an increase in my REM time of nearly an hour, and a decrease in my deep sleep, both in the middle of my asleep time, like what you saw.  I would be curious why trimming awake time at either end would have that kind of impact.
I have a Charge 2, firmware ver: 22.22.53.4 But my Fitbit app & desktop is only showing Sleep Pattern.  When I had Alta HR, returned it for Charge 2, it would display the Sleep Stages.  Why is the update not showing the new info?
Has anyone tried to quantify the impact of CPAP on Fitbit sleep data? Could you please share your data (screenshots or at least the averages)? I'm particularly interested in the amount of time awake, the number of restless periods, the amount of time in deep sleep, and the amount of time in REM sleep. Thank you!
My sleep is absoluetly terrible. I layed in bed last night for 7 hours, only slept for 4 of those hours. I find it so interesting how you THINK you're getting enough sleep, but really you could be unconsciously awake.
Apparently the SpO2 feature has started rolling out on the quiet, and for now only in America. Praying it will appear in Europe soon too....https://www.thurrott.com/wearables/fitbit/228243/fitbit-enables-spo2-monitoring-on-newer-wearables
The sleep chart graph should be in blue and red ---- blue shows when you're sleeping and red shows when you're awake, restless or otherwise sleeping rather poorly.  If the chart graph does not show these colours, then there may be something wrong with your programme and I would suggest contacting FitBit or look into the Help Forums for further guidance.  Certainly the FitBit Chart does not show you dead at any time even though it might look that way by the way the chart is set up and reading your sleep/non-sleep patterns.  Best of luck in solving this issue.

I can see how to log my sleep manually from 11pm to 7am but how do I log my restless and awake periods if I want to do it manually. Thanks to everyone in advance
I have been taking melotonin for over a year on and off, it really helps with sleep but I would suggest start real low since everyone may react differently than others.  But it has helped me sleep longer and have better deep sleeps and sometimes it gives you more energy the next day after you wake up.  Its helped me with anxiety and has been mentioned by many such as Ex President Donald Trump saying it may even help fight against the Covid virus.
@cjgrayso hey there- did the suggestion Dave give work for you? Are you all set or can we help further?

Hi @aleishat, If you let me know which fitbit you have, I can post a link to the manual for it. In general, the tracker itself picks up the data, and the app displays it nicely with charts and graphs.

Hello @JoeT-123, @djflowerz. Welcome to the community forums! @alexthecat Nice to see you around and thanks for your great input. 
 
Thank you very much for taking the time to report this matter. I'd like to let you know that there are some factors that could prevent your Fitbit devices to track sleep stages. I recommend taking into consideration the following tips: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages? I also recommend keeping the Fitbit App up to date. 
 
If this is not the case, please note that we recently identified missing data in the health metrics tile, including sleep and heart rate. Thanks for your patience while this is investigated. 
 
See you around. 

	Wilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.
mine has been doing the same thing for the last 2 nights. I was going to try to contact fitbit today, I think it is a glitch on their site.
I've adjusted my setting from normal to sensitive and back again with no luck.  I move around very little when I sleep. I wake up a few times during the night.  I usually roll over and go back to sleep.  I wake up in the same position I fell asleep in each time.
In my opinion sleep score is a novelty bit of information, but not useful to me at all. I can’t actively do anything to improve it. If Fitbit wants to leave it as part of the sleep data, okay fine. But DO NOT REPLACE THE WEEKLY AVERAGE NUMBER OF HOURS SLEPT with the average sleep score. I could care less about my average sleep score. My average number of hours of sleep per week was one of the top data items I track. Bring it back!
Waffle. I often go 5-6 hours every night and top with an 8-9 hours once a week. Healthy and fine.   😂 only cranky when my fitbit surge goes a week without synching.
Hello.  Can someone please tell me how to see my sleep results on my Inspire HR?  It shows the cresent moon, but it grayed out.

I have the same issue which started after an iPhone update. Haven’t been able to get sleep or steps stats on the phone app since then. The answer from 2019 doesn’t help, the option to add sleep is not able to be selected. Even with a premium membership, which I have.
Waking or restless sleep does NOT mean you have a sleep disorder. Usually, it is a lack of specific vitamins. Stay away from any doctor or "friend" who suggests a drug -- those elements only mask an underlying problem. (kind of like putting perfume on crap to hide the smell). The true answer is find what you are lacking and if you need some natural aides to help your sleep until you find the missing vitamin -- try 2-3 ounces of all natural cherry juice, or a natural sleep product like CalmFort -- will also save you thousands of dollars!
Hi Monika,Sorry to hear you're still having trouble. I did get a new update when I went to uninstall the app again & got sorted. Why it tells us in the Fitbit site that Versa 2 has been updated if that is not correct is very misleading. I do have Premium as wanted access to more Mindfulness tapes & more accurate readings of sleep. It works fine for most of the time & when you go to report something not working they have new system where it's very hard to remember all instructions. The old way was much better where they'd answer you maybe an hour later but your questions & their answers were there to check back on, The new system just disappears with person helping.Hope you've been sorted.Ann

Have you tried doing mindfulness meditation in Fitbit app before sleep? If consistently done, quality of sleep can improve.
You might want to experiment with other options for wearing the tracker. Some people have found they can get tennis wrist band (terry cloth) and cut a slit in it to slide the fitbit in. Or they use an old sweat sock. The fitbit band itself I have always found to be uncomfortable as well. Or, like others have said, just don't use the sleep feature. If you know you sleep ok, there might not be any reason to bother with this.
Does anyone know how to get any of these sleep tracking fitbits to work correctly?  I have NEVER had a night of sleep in which the fitbit was able to track my sleep other than basic details.   Every time it says it was unable to get enough information for sleep details or a sleep score (technically I do get a score each night, zero).  Doesn't matter which arm, how tight or loose I wear it, NEVER any details, just the basics.  What is the trick to get this to function correctly?
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
This is to pass on an observation.   My charge 2 stopped providing sleep level detail.  A couple days later I visited my medical doctor who determined I was in Afib.  Had to have a cardioversion to restore proper heart beat.  Fitbit provided sleep detail when regular beat restored.   On review noted heartrate data also indicated significant change.   Important to understand fitbit and data it provides.
Hello @Dozydotty. Welcome to the community forums. @MelWitty It's nice to see you around and thanks for your input. 
 
@Dozydotty I'm sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for the information and the troubleshooting steps you've tried. If uninstalling and reinstalling the App doesn't help, please let me know.
 
On a side note, I'd like to let you know that the Sleep Score isn't received if Sleep Stages aren't being tracked and not related to an inconvenience with the system itself.  
 
If you haven't done so, I'd recommend taking into consideration the following information and troubleshooting steps from this post. 
 
I look forward to your response.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
@WavyDavey or @zapleahy Do you know if there is a resource bank of images of people who know they do not have apnea or other disorders. I.e. A normal set of results. This would be most useful for comparison. Could you post one of your sleep images if you are a "normal" sleeper.
I got Premium also in the last month and half. My restlessness % is pretty low - 5% last night with a Sleep Score of 91.  Even the other night when i got an 87 sleep score my restlessness % was 6%. I am very active with an average 18,000 steps a day and 150 active minutes which helps me go to sleep fast and rarely move around. The other key is not having to go to the bathroom at night as I drink a lot of water - 170 ounces a day (1 ounes for every 1 pound I weigh).  I think being active in the day makes you more tired and you have a lower score assuming you have black out shades, relax/read before bed and have no electronics and a cool bed room temperature - 66 degrees is my goal.
Excellent point about caffeine, not consuming it late in the day... Caffeine has something in common with radioactive substances - it has a 'half life'. Caffeine's half life is 5-6 hours.... so means that half of the amount of caffeine you ingest will still be circulating in your system after around 6 hours - so it can take up to 12 hours to actually leave the body. I'd say that the latest time that one would be wanting to finish drinking a caffeinated beverage would be around 2pm or so - maybe even as early as midday. And definitely not having a high caffeine pre-workout drink if you hit the gym in the early evening 😄 😄

Bro - go do a sleep examination. I did one and I was AWFUL! I now utilize a sleep mask every night yet it has made all the difference!
Thanks Roessie I was thinking of asking for a sleep study because I have had terrible bouts with insominia for years, but I don't want to waste the time and money if I really don't have a problem. I've tried every over the counter treatment and 4-6 Rx with little luck.My mom did suggest one other thing. She asked if I could be sleepwalking.I did it a lot as a child and this morning when I woke up I had 412 steps already.There is no way walking down the stairs one time and going to the bathroom once accounted for that many steps, so I wonder....
Thank you. That is good to know.

Sleeping pills are usually sedatives. Being sedated can often wreak havoc with and be very detrimental to your sleep cycles. That's probably one of the reasons that doctors don't recommend them for prolonged use.
Yipee!  Its not just me!  This happens to me too. Did you ever figure out how to fix it?
I find the sleep tracking on the Fitbit very disappointing.  I know for sure, it took me over 1 hour to fall alseep last night and the fitbit tells me I fell asleep right away.  It tells me I had 93% efficiency.  I am no where near that.  I find this very disappointing.  I hope Fitbit looks into this.  This was one of the main reasons I purchased the Fitbit.  I see someone has mentioned Sleep Cycle - I am going to check into that and compare it to Fitbit.
Have you tried setting you sensitivty to movement as sensitive instead of normal and see what happens? Might be worth a shot.
Just a quick question: Is it ok to sleep before working out? Yesterday, I got home from school only to take a shower and then fell asleep. I didn't manage to work out because the gym closes at 8 p.m., but I did feel better.However, while trying to lose weight, there's a little bit of guilt knowing I had the option of walking on the treadmill for at least ten minutes. And no, I do not own a FitBit yet. I'm interested in the ChargeHR, but it's gonna take up to two paychecks to buy one.

We still don't have this app, you've had 6 months, do you guys have a development team?
I have struggles with insomnia my whole life. It's a horrible thing to live with but like you said, there's things that work better than others. I've taken all the sleeping pills you can imagine and they all worked for 1 week, then stopped working. I went back to my doctor desprate fore more answeres and he put me on clonazepam. This isn't a sleeping pill. It is usually used for patients who have seizures, but he says it can be used to help patients sleep. This has worked wonders for me so far. I've used it for the past 2 weeks. I don't sleep more (sleep about 4-6 hours) but i dont wake up as much durning the night! Hope somehow this can help you. Good luck!
So are you saying that the movement I'm having is normal for sensitivity mode?
Hi David,same here. My RHR was always between 50 and 54. Now its 58, since the introduction of sleep stages. I wonder if this will be corrected in the next update?Annette
Thank you for your answer. I deleted the app and download it again but nothing helped. I was told to reset it to factory settings and that is the last thing i want to do since I will lose all my music downloaded from the deceased fitbit connect. I think fitbit is trying to find a reason for us to subscribe to premium, deezer and pandora. After many years and several fitbit this one will be my last fitbit for sure.
Hi, Not sure if you ever got more information, and I don't have any, but I thought you might be able to answer a question of mine. I still can't tell if "typical range" means what you mentioned above, typical for people of my age and gender, or it means my "typical range", based on averaging my last 7 days for example. Logically I guess it could be either. If you know, can you tell me which, and how you know. Thanks.
I am having trouble telling when I have the Flex on sleep mode. Last night I accidentally tapped the band too many times and then I could not tell what mode it was in. Consequently I did not get my sleep information. My band does not vibrate when it goes into sleep mode.

It sounds like your brain is functioning on day time and unable to switch off because you've been using technology right up until you go to bed.  Shut down *all* your technology (even your TV if you watch it before you head to bed) and only allow yourself to listen to the radio and read in the half an hour before you want to sleep so that you brain kinda goes "ooh!  It must be bed time!".  It doesn't have to be a big, planned out routine, but maybe try turning off all your technology before you even get changed for bed, so no watching the telly in your jammies or whatever  😉  Ideally take all technology (other than your radio) out of the bedroom so that you're not tempted to use it and find a magazine or book that relaxes you, rather than makes you think.  Short stories are ideal but not puzzles or anything that you have to think about (studying etc)... the less you have to use your brain at bed time the better! It'll take a while, so don't be disappointed if it doesn't work tonight, just change your bedtime routine and you'll be asleep before you know it!

Hi Silvia, Thanks for the information; I did see the FAQ on sensitive vs normal but it doesn't really answer my question.If an activity such as rolling over counts as "awake" in normal mode, I would assume the same is true for sensitive mode. What other types of movements and to what intensity are considered "awake".Can the Flex differentiate between an "awake" event such as a rollover versus a "restless" moment of re positioning a foot? Can this data be segregated between "sleep", "restless" and "awake" ?
I am in agreement with everyone above.  I reviewed my sleep average regularly and was very disappointed when it was removed and replace with a sleep score.  At this point, the sleep score has no significance for me.  The average was a physical value I could relate too.  You can keep the sleep score but I would very much like to see my sleep average brought back. Thank you.
Thank you for your input @GisselleM! ☺ I guess everyone has to find what works for them.
Tired to follow several links mentioned in the sleep tracking discussions and each time received this error message... thought you would like to know
Fitbit (for adults) is barely capable of providing approximations for exercise and calories, and isinadequate to analyse sleep. It is a somewhat technologically sophisticated devices, but absolutelynot a medical device. The Fitbit should not be used for any children, particularly not sleep tracking.
I just always wear my charge on my wrist like where I used to wear a watch.  I wear it like this when I work out and when I sleep and work.  Hope this answers your question.  I have not found  my charge to act up when I sleep.  I did have to initially change my sleep settings to normal (changing it from sensitive) when I set it up.  You might want to look at your sleep settings and see if you can find the right setting for you.

Hi @SunsetRunner, @NellyG. It's nice to see you around! 
 
Thank you very much for sharing your experiences. @SunsetRunner, @NellyG I believe this might not be your case but I've heard that people who have arthritis are often hesitant to exercise because they’re afraid of making their pain worse. However, regular exercise tends to decrease joint pain and help maintain joints’ range of motion. Plus, people who exercise regularly tend to sleep better in general. But to begin a safe exercise program, check with your doctor or physical therapist. 
 
I think using pillows can help. Pillows can be just as important as your choice of mattress. If you have hip or knee arthritis and like to sleep on your side, you may benefit from a pillow between your knees. If you have shoulder arthritis you may be most comfortable using a wedge pillow and sleeping on your back.
 
See you around.

I have severe insomnia and have had for over 10yrs now. There are two things that have really helped me take a turn in my sleep pattern. One is journalling. My Doctor recommended it. Usually, at the end of my work day I take 20-30min to journal my day. Things that have been on my mind, a to-do list, and just all around venting. When he told me this I thought...this isn't going to help. After a few weeks I noticed I was sleeping better. I don't stress if I don't journal everyday but find I naturally want to at least a few times a week.The second is Seroquel. This is actually a treatment for Bi-Polar disorder but they have found that a small dose of 25-50mg helps people with overactive brains like mine. I take it before bed and actually log a few hours of sleep at night which is a HUGE step for me. Hopefully, this helps others a little. I have been through numerous sleep studies and a myriad of medications. This is what I have found works the best for me with little to no side-effects.

I often remember some of the dreams I had that night and when I talk about it I notice it is a rather rare treat. Believe it or not, I dreamt about the Fitbit sleep log last night  . I still remember a dream I had during the holidays between primary school and secondary school; there were planets flying through the kitchen, entering via the window and leaving via the door of the house we lived in at the time. I wonder if there is anyone else out there who remembers quite a lot of their dreams atleast on the day itself they had them. Most of my dreams I seem to forget after another night of sleep to a few nights. There are just a few that I still remember well.

I'm not sure what type of conversion your reffering to @Sheeshee. If your awake, are you really sleeping? This awake time is something your sleep monitor should know about and would show up in a professional sleep study. Several users have worn their fitbits while participating in a requested or non requested sleep study and found that their Fitbit sleep record was remarkably close in accuracy in the produced graph. If I was going to discuss my sleep habits with my doctor, I would show him my phone and the sleep graphs Fitbit produced My doctor is smart enough to understand what he is looking at. When it comes to sleep a it is very common for the body to switch types of sleep throughout the night.You might want to read the sleep FAQ. What should I know about sleep stages?Learn about the sleep stages you cycle through at night I went ahead and moved your post to the sleep board

Im curious what others notice as well. Note the original question / concern was sleeping heart rate that's HIGHER than resting heart rate.  My wife sees similar where her sleeping heart rate is higher than resting heart rate for a majority of the night, usually 50-60% of the night her sleeping heart rate is higher than resting heart rate. She's restless like 15-20% as well.  This is different than me where my sleeping heart rate is lower than resting heart rate over 90% of the night (usually only 4-5% above resting heart rate). Thought it was perhaps her inspire hr so she switched to my charge 3 last night but same result . We'll try for a few more days to see if it is consistent.  What would cause ur sleeping heart rate to be higher than resting heart rate for 50-60% of the night ? Is this normal?
r Why do I have to create a new sleep record? Does this thing know when I am asleep when I put it in sleep mode or not? Also, it could not tell I was cycling, it counted it as steps, placed cycling in my notes and the total time, but it didi not convert to cycling, still looking at steps. Help!!

Hi @MrsCoachG The time awake is not included in the sleep time, so you should not need to subtract it.  For example, mine said a sleep time of 6 hr and 9 min for last night.  The break down was shown as 30 min awake (not included in the total sleep time), 1 hr 28 min REM (88 min), 4 hr 1 min light (241 min) and 40 min deep.  The REM, light and deep times were included for a total of 6 hrs and 9 min of total sleep time.I hope this helps 😊
maybe you are just moving a lot in your sleep?  I know on mine, there are times when I'm perfectly still and it "says" I'm asleep and I know I am not.  The Fitbit registers movements evidently, and it can tell when you are up and around moving or sitting still. When I'm working at my computer and sitting for an hour or two at a time, I can tell that there's no "steps" being counted. But when I'm up, running to the bathroom or the mailbox, or even going to and from my car... more "steps" are registered.  It's not an exact science but I was impressed at how accurate mine is. You are supposed to wear your Fitbit on your non-dominant arm (Fitbit Flex wristband is what I have). I don't know about the other ones.I hope this info helps you. I"m sorta new at this too. I have only had mine for a month but I love it! DarleneMNC
Hi @ All! I've got my fitbit charge Hr for a while now  and this morning i was in kind of a shock. my heartrate showed at 40rpm, what's kind of low ? i tought, maybe it was only this night, but when i looked at my history, it says almost every day between 38-42 at lowest! im 27y  and i sport like 2times a week. non professional. i'm really curious now what the average heartrate is from other fitbit charge Hr users... in sleeping state..
how is sleep efficiency calculated?

Hello @Gstsaver My Hrv tends to be on the low side, like yours, and wondered if mine was in average range. According to this article, I'm in average range for age 60+: What is Heart Rate Variability If you're concerned that you're out of average range, you probably should consider discussing your heart rate & Hrv with your doctor.

I’m an older guy with a growing prostate and I need to go up at night at least once, sometimes twice. This never interrupts sleep monitoring, though trips to the bathroom do show up in various forms on graphs. Last night, I had to go up twice, at about 1am and 7am. Both trips showed up on the step graph:  They also show up on the sleep graph: The bathroom is next door to my bedroom, so it’s a very short distance. I’ll try to go to the bathroom downstairs, and maybe walk a few extra steps to the kitchen, to see if it makes any difference. How far away is your bathroom, and how long does it take you before you’re back to bed? My Fitbit is the Ionic, I use normal sleep sensitivity (i.e. the default).

Hi, out of curiosity - which setting are you on? sensitive or normal?
My SP02 % levels during sleep shows on my Fitbit watch, but not on the Website under Sleep Log. Did I forget to set something up right?

The link did not answer the question. So are you saying that if I were to nap then they would be different but because I don't they are exactly the same? They even have the same titles so it is very confusing.
I've only used the One for 4 nights so far, but each time I've been restless 12 times and awake twice. Interestingly I always wake up (and I was already aware of this) about 30 minutes after I first fall asleep for the night! Doesn't matter what time it is when I go to bed, 30 mins later I wake up, just for a few minutes!
I also accidentally put am for pm and it won't let me correct. Orchid
Hey all, I remember seeing this thread a while back and my friends and I were really into this idea. One of my friends sent me this recently and looks like something was finally released on the App Store for sleep challenges/competitions. It's called "Sleepover" and we've tried it out a couple days- it works really well and looks great. Not a Fitbit exclusive feature but seems to actually be better that way since we can compete with our friend that uses Sleep Cycle with Apple Watch. I'll attach the link below in case anyone is still interested in the idea of sleep competitions!https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleepover-sleep-to-compete/id1556384666
Here is an article from Fitbit that can help answer your question..

I got my Fitbit Surge 6 days ago. I set it to sensitive. The sleep pattern confirmed mine, and my husband's suspicions, that I have very poor sleep. Sleep efficiency 61%, and cycle length (also confirmed with a different mobile app) is only 60 mins not the usual 90 mins. I 'need' about 10-11 hours sleep to feel half-way decent. With 10 hrs sleep I get about 6 hrs. With 8-9 hrs sleep (my usual weekday allowance) I get about 5 hrs. My husband always complains that my restless sleep causes him lost sleep too 😞 (I say to him imagine how I feel!). I am usually fatigued all day and have trouble getting up in the morning and am struggling to maintain work function. I'm glad I got my Fitbit so I have proof of what is happening. I was tested for sleep apnoea some years ago and had borderline/mild apnoea. I lost 70 lbs (30 kg) and then got retested and the apnoea had disappeared (good because I didn't tolerate the CPAP at all). I would like to know what a 'normal' sleep pattern looks like and what another poor sleeper looks like so I can show my GP and get referred. Is there a specific kind of sleep study she can request other than for sleep apnoea? I have added 2 screenshots of my usual sleep pattern, if some of you could add yours with a brief comment on if you sleep well or not, that would help me gather evidence for my GP appointment. TIA.
I only discovered sleep insights yesterday on my blaze and thought it was a really cool addition to the fitbit suite, but it looks like it didn't record in detail last night for some reason.Any way that I can check to ensure my blaze settings are correct or is there something else that would cause it to not record?
Here is what snapshots of my own sleep look like (snapshots taken on Android phone, uploaded to Google Drive, downloaded to laptop, posted via Chrome on laptop). This is the upper part:  And this is the lower part:  I believe it is normal to have the bulk of your deep sleep earlier in the night.

I think I may have a problem, 7 out of 14 nights look like the pics. What are some opinions? I’m 5’1” approximately 130 athletic build and active with normal BP and HR, so I’m thinking it may be genetic? My dad had sleep apnea as well.

Sleep stages depend on tracking your heart rate so it won't be coming to the fitbit One.
Hi forum, I’ve just noticed that my awakenings have dramatically decreased. Has the threshold for counting awakenings been changed? My sleep graph still shows the awakenings but they are not all being counted. A majority of those not being counted are 30s but there are a few which are 2mins. My historic awakenings count have also been affected by this.
i am a Sailor (ship Engineer) i have been for most of my life and that usually means i am at work 9 months every year, thanks to this "wonderful" job i hardly ever get a good night rest, i am so used to it that even on my off days i still cannot sleep past 4 hours at night.   how do i improve my sleeping hours because i know deep down that i am not sleeping healthy and that bothers me many ways than not.
If the band is big enough, try wearing it on your ankle
Welcome to the Fitbit Community, @DaughterAnn and thanks @JohnnyRow for the information provided.
 
@DaughterAnn If you use the option Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app, you'll get the simplified sleep details. As @JohnnyRow said above, just wear your Fitbit device when you go to sleep so you can get sleep stages and sleep score. You can find more details on this help article.

Thank you for your input -- it's tempting to purchase a sleep number bed again.  I'd forgotten the difference.
Ok so for the last few months I've noticed throughout my day I feel tired, at first, I thought it will go away but it didn't maybe it's my diet although I feel my diet is pretty healthy. So is the 21st century I went online but couldn't really find any websites that suggested any fixes that had symptoms similar to what I'm experiencing, I'm going to keep looking and will keep you posted on what I find. If I can't find anything and the problem persists I guess ill have to look for medical advice from a doctor. Please let em know if anyone else has this problem or if you had this problem before and how you fixed it. Regards Paul EDIT: Did Some Searching Found A Great Website Might Help https://energyuplift.wixsite.com/home
Olana, I've experienced the same sleep problem while wearing my new Fitbit. Although I loved tracking my REM, Deep and light sleep, it's not worth it. Reluctantly removed the watch last night and had a normal night's sleep.
Its not impossible that you can fall asleep in under a minute, but to do it everytime everyday seems a bit of a reach. My normal time to sleep is under 2 min, but then I was in the military for 20+ years and we learned to sleep whenever possible, regardless of the surroundings. You may be blessed, with being able to have sweet dreams and restful nights, enjoy them 🙂
If the nap is at least an hour, Fitbit should pick it up automatically by itself.

Thank you! 😀
I hadn't thought about the shower before bed before, but it makes sense. And it will save time in the morning too.  I'll give it a try.
I have lost my fitbit about 5 times since buying it last month due to falling off my wrist and fortunately someone returned each time.  I stenciled my name and phone number on the fitbit.   My wife and daughter who both have one say theirs has never fallen off and they say I must not be fastening all the way.  I believe I do fasten securely but I can't seem to get it to stay on my wrist.  Could it be a defective wrist band?  I will use something as some have suggested  to help keep it attached but it doesn't seem like it should just fall off when I am walking or doing activities.  Love it but if I permanently lose I would not buy again due to this reason.
I read every night until I get sleepy and turn the light off. The best I can think to do because it is such a routine thing is I simply start sleep function when I pick up the book - that way in the morning I know exactly what period of time is "reading/dropping off" time - it seems to work well since it something I do regularly.
How do I set my fit bit so I get a sleep score overnight.  It seems to only happen once in awhile.Thank you in advance.
@Acea you may be retaining water during your sleep which is causing your limbs to swell. Make sure you are hydrated through out the day to ensure you don't have a bunch of salt stored up and make sure you tinkle before bed. If it still causes discomfort, as much as you would want sleep data, it may not be a good option for you...

I wear snug enough to imprint my skin. You're a veteran runner, I see. I hope to call myself that one day but I'm not there yet. I walk moderate hikes in the woods and work on my feet, but I'm not an athlete, so my resting heart rate is within normal ranges. 40, however,  especially  for ten minutes like that, makes me wonder if it's a red flag or if I'm being silly.
Thank you. How can you see the breakdown of your sleep for the week? For example- light sleep, rem etc
Same problem with the Alta. I've logged out and back into the app, turned my phone off and on...and simply cannot find the way to set up sleep tracking.
Consult a sleep lab, They will probably can help you. Sometimes if a pt is complaining of the symptoms you stated. You may have what is called Central sleep apnea. This usually occurs in pt, that are not overweight and is in fairly good shape.  Central sleep apnea is a syndrome to where your nerve that functions your diaphragm doesn't work and your breathing just stops, because the diaphragm doesn't inflate your lungs. The sleep lab monitors 4 things. Your nasal breathing, mouth breathing, Chest movements and stomach movements (this is your diaphragm). When all 4 of these don't show up on the recording then this classified as Central Sleep apnea. I have been a Respiratory Therapist for 40 yrs and operated a sleep lab for 10 yrs. Hope this helps. The fitbit should show a rymthical pattern of movements and then no movements.
I think I'm going to switch back to normal mode. I wish there was something in between normal and sensitive. Admittedly I had a bad night last night due to my hip pain, and I was more restless than usual. However, it shows that I took 139 steps around 4:00 this morning. What!! My house is so small, I don't even get 139 steps when I walk from one end of it to the other and back again! And I've never been prone to sleepwalking. I do know that I was especially restless around 4:00 because of pain and I did get up to take some Tylenol. That should have been about 20 steps. So apparently my flipping over and flailing around in bed trying to get comfortable was logged as steps. Hmmm...
The fitbit one tracks sleep and has an alarm. Why not incorporate the two and provide functionality like that of the Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock where it will wake you during 'light' sleep??? I'm always looking for ways to consolidate gadgets!!Thanks!
it's just awful, I have such a problem..
@Lorneputnam wrote:You know when i show people my fitbit and explain all that it does the most interesting part everyone says is the sleep tracking! Agreed. The sleep tracker and the HR monitor are two major reasons I got a Fitbit.
Post of screen capture would help greatly. Use camera icon above text entry box.

Maybe it is to tight or too loose.  It knows when I wake up.  I am trying to see if I sleep better with out sugar.  What do dreams do to the sleep tracker??
Have you tried adjusting how tight your Fitbit is on your wrist? If it's too loose it can't always get a good reading? Also consider the placement of it on your wrist. Fitbit help has an article about heart rate HERE that might help.One final note, if you are feeling nervous about your heart rate, please call a medical professional. We all want to help on this forum, but we are not doctors.

Hi @WyldHaggis, Based on the early morning light and bathroom necessity, I would guess the only way you're going to be able to get more sleep, is to start going to bed earlier. If your body is used to getting less sleep than it wants, you may want to take the change gradually. Something like going to bed 10 minutes earlier each week?

Hello @Topher0522, welcome to the forums. I am sorry for the delayed response. 
 
I assume you may have found the setting already, but here you have the path to activate or deactivate the bedtime reminder. 

Open the Fitbit app
Tap on the sleep tile

You will see the list of sleep logs


On the top right corner tap on the gear icon. 

You will enter the sleep feature settings


There you have the option to turn off the bedtime reminders

If you have any other questions or concerns, please let us know. You can always post on a thread for your specific tracker.

OldbobYou make a good point about there being a change after software updates.  I was trying to establish IF it changed without any judgement about which was right.  It's possible they improved the accuracy.   I noticed it because the chart changed precisely when the software changed at least in my case.  Twice.  That's why I asked the question.   I don't have a second source for RHR. To compare them.  David
Having Narcolepsy is a disability but it doesn't mean you can't have a life. It means the time you are awake, has to be compacted to fit your whole life into.What people normally do is go through a 14-16 hr. day; we have to compact our life into just a few hours.It requires a lot of planning. I have been on 1 Nuvigil daily that I cut in half, and 2 provigil in my morning and 2 in my afternoon.I have been on that regimen for years.I am also cataplectic like you are which explains the Xyrem. But I stopped the Xryem a long time ago.I am aware of my emotions and try to avoid any extremes which bring on the the onset of cataplexia.The best dosage for me was 4 provigil in the morning and 4 in the evening which worked, But the insurance company would no longer insure it. They felt I didn't need it.I continue my life not knowing what it is to feel truly rested and most of the time like someone has put some clothes pins on my eyelids and pinned them open.😃In society, if you don't bleed, the consensus is you are not sick.So you won't get any sympathy, you will as always have to struggle.School is a struggle. You have to walk and read, you can't lie down and read or sit in a chair and read, you won't last long before your friend,sleep comes to visit you or before your attention span gets shorter and shorter. As far as audio lessons, as long as the reader is not monotoned and boring which will put anyone to sleep.Narcoleptics have to be more disciplined than the average person because of our time constraints.I am also bi-polar so that brings in another problem that has to be resolved.You can resign yourself a life of sleep but how would you live? One thing I do is I don't excuse myself to anyone, I used to feel guilty when I was tired and just went to bed to sleep.My doctor put me on naps during the day but you have to be careful the naps don't turn into hours instead of just an hour or less. Two naps a day.I think you can learn about anything and be about anything, but any job requiring long hours will not work for you.I don't drive because I don't want to kill anybody.You can do a job like real estate where you will be moving and if you do drive; it'll be short distances.You have to move when you're a narcoleptic, because sitting down or lying down will lead to excess sleepiness.Nurses require long hours, so do PA' s for the most part.It's hard to find a profession you can really enjoy that is cut into small sections, but it's something you will have to do otherwise your disability will become overwhelming.You can't pretend your nervous system and glandular system works like everybody else's; it doesn't. You have to discover how to work within your disability LIKE a normal person.It's tough.You can do it. You must.Take care.

Is morning after a seemingly good night sleep my wife's Fitbit showed she had only one hour of sleep. Now in the evening prior to midnight she took a nap on the couch and we got up @1230 to go to actual bed.  But this morning it showed her having only 1hr(ish) sleep. Is there a way to fix this anomaly?  We are both using Charge2's
@Lissco About 9 years ago I had the same issue. I was always tired at work, and never wanted to get out of bed. I snored when I slept and kept my wife up. I went to the Dr and had a sleep study done and was diagnosed with sleep apnia, I now have a CPAP machine (for the last 9 years) and I sleep mush sounder and wake up more refreshed... now I just have to stop staying up till 11 or 12 and getting up at 5:30 🙂 I would really suggest a trip to a specialist or tell your Dr of your issues and get tested.
Depends on how long you're awake for I guess, I just had 6 hours sleep, registered 98% and x3 awake.All I remember of being awake is turning over in bed/moving and I fell straight back to sleep. I think it would drop the score if you woke and could not get back to sleep, or stopped for a few minutes for water etc.  The longer you sleep also I would guess allows more awake periods.
So, since I have been using the CPAP machine my sleep has been better and I feel much more awake and energetic during the day. I am also much more positive, but my Charge 5 has no idea how to record my sleep. Since using the CPAP, my Fitbit records between 1 and 3 hours of sleep maximum per night, whereas I allow for 9 hours and I am asleep for at least 7 of them.For clarity, my bedtime routine has not changed and previously Fitbit recorded between 6 and 8 hours per night. Now that I sleep better, the results are absolutely useless. Is anyone else experiencing this?
@Specky   Thanks for the new screenshot.  Your graph has more lines than mine.  I personally don't put a lot of weight on that graph as a major determinant of sleep quality.  There are several external factors that affect sleeping heart rate that have nothing to do with sleep quality.  Help article  I pay more attention to my deep sleep, REM sleep, and percent tossing and turning to judge my sleep quality.

Hi @Alan71383 - I found these instructions in the Fitbit Help pages:
Wow! You sleep pretty well.
Why didn't my fitbit collect my sleep data last night?
I understand your problem perfectly. Recently, I have had frequent problems with sleep. Sometimes for several days, terrible insomnia.
Turns out I have an enlarged left atrium and I am on a waiting list to see a cardiologist.Sent from Yahoo Mail. Get the app
Being a Respiratory Therapist and Polysomograher for some 40 years. Sleep apnea occurs in all of us. The problem occurs when this syndrome interupts your daily routine. Such as falling asleep during day, feeling tired after you wake up, loud snoring that disrupts your partner or you wake up several times a night feeling short of breath.. Many factors can contribute to sleep apnea. Seeing your Dr. would help, if you feel you have any of these symptoms. Having mild symptoms seems to be normal, What they look at is what they call the AHI (Apnea Hypopnea index). This is the total number of apnea's that occur with hypopnea events divided by the total sleep time. An Apnea is an event that when there is no air flow through the nose or mouth, but the diaphragm is still moving for at least 30 seconds. A hypopnea event is when the breathing efforts are 50% below your normal efforts, which is usually recorded at the beginning of the test. If the AHI is at or below 5 then that's considered normal range. Most people fall into this range. That means you are having 5 events per hour. Which again is normal.  Most Dr's usually recommends weight loss, More exercise. Many experts say you should exercise at least 4 hrs a week for people who have greater then 10 AHI.
I have had the force for about 3 wks and each day my sleep was recorded, now all of a sudden since Friday, its not recording my sleep anymore. Any suggestions?
Hi Wizard, thank you for sharing this article with me I am going to do more research on this. The idea of going to sleep at 8 PM sounds great but unfortuantely in our busy lives it almost seems unattainable. I used to have a certain time I went to bed which was 10 PM then it got pushed to a later time because of just life happening. I am going ot buy some blue light blocking glasses. Is the a significant different in the amoutn of blue light emitted from a TV vs. a laptop?

So vitamins at night. 
Now that you mention this as a regeneration period it does make sense. Your body has all night to absorb and integrate the vitamins into your system so that by the time you get up you can feel the effects on you (being more energetic) Also you get your breakfast afterwards so that you get additional nutrients to get you trough the day. 
I will give it a try, Thank you @Awen, @Colinm39, @I-train-hard, @mtlee.
Thought this was very interesting and I'm not even a mouth breather as far as I know.
I'm a simple man. I like naps. I've been looking at getting a fitbit for one specific reason. I want it to continuously monitor for when I fall asleep and wake me up after it detects that I've slept a certain amount of time. For example, I want to be able to set it up so if it detects I've fallen asleep at any point, it will wake me up after 30 minutes. I've read that some models have continuous sleep tracking (Force, Charge, Charge HR, Surge), but I don't know if any of them have a feature/compatible app that allows it to wake me up after a certain amount of sleep. Does anyone have any suggestions/guidance on this? Thanks.

https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/08/41...ort-sleep-geneI have always slept 4 hours since I was a child. I use to worry I couldn't sleep more than 4 hours. But I have always bounced out of bed with lots of energy and will go thru the day the same way around 11 I will feel like I am getting tired but wont fall alseep til 12 and I awake promptly at 4 am.I have had many sleep studies and it shows once I lay down I am asleep within seconds , it was described like a light a switch that turns off. Then I awake the same way. Its not slowly its immediate and I wake up happy,talking, ready for the world.I have been prescribed sleeping pills which never work i sleep 4 hours then i feel tired but awake.This article explains people the short sleep syndrome, and finally I feel like it explains why I don't need sleep . Normally people stare at me, like there is something wrong if you don't get 8 hours. I wear a fitbit to bed its always pretty much the same thing each night. I am awake 37 min I wake up thru out the night usually around midnight, Rem is 28 min Light 3 hrs and Deep 31. I do not dream or I never had one I could remember when waking up.
Hi-  I just got a new iphone 14, installed the FitBit app, logged in successfully, synced my Inspire2 to the new iphone and I can see my old sleep patterns just fine.  But now the fitbit won't monitor my sleep patterns automatically.  I have to create a "Sleep log"!!!  I have to tell the log when I'm going to sleep and tell it when I wake up.  No recording of deep sleep or rem sleep patterns at all.  Just a solid line of sleep.  What happened?  I have this fitbit for sleep monitoring only and if something has changed in your services, it seems quite worthless now. Please tell me I'm missing something...

Welcome to the forum. Let's start with a few questions, so I can better help you. What type of tracker do you have? What is the main goal you are trying to track (steps, distance, sleep...). Depending on your goals and when you plan to wear your tracker, you may want to set up your reminders to move during a limited time (perhaps in the evening after work).

When you start reading all of the help files, somewhere it will tell you to wake your Flex up before syncing to make it sync faster.  I've found it works better when changing modes as well.  Now, I tap twice to wake it up and display either goal, or dancing lights (sleep mode indicator).  As soon as the lights go out, I tap repeatedly until the lights change, usually 5 taps, but don't count.  Once those lights go out, I tap twice again to verify I have the mode I want. In the morning, after I've put it back into non-sleep mode, I log into the PC and sync the Flex.  I've actually found this works best if I really just wake up the PC and Flex, then go about my business for the next few minutes.  I come back 10-20 minutes later, unlock the screen-saver again, bring up the website, sync and check my dashboard and sleep log.
I have had my Charge 3 for about a month now.  Just this past weekend it stop tracking my sleep.  Anyone know how to fix this???  I went into my app and everything look like its turned on but I still cant get it to work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Thank You
Interesting. I had three big spikes last night which is unusual but I also woke up last night and my right arm and hand (arm I wear watch on) were asleep. Maybe that explains the spikes last night.
Pardon the personal question but do you sleep alone or is there a spouse, sig other or pet moving around in the bed? Even when my dog is in the same room and sleeping on the floor, her snoring can wake me numerous times. That can destroy your restful sleep.
Hi all is anyone having trouble with sleep recording?  Since the last update I no longer get a sleep score so wonder if it was a fault with the update or if there is something I need to do on the app? 
 
 
 
Moderator edit: subject for clarity
Hello everyone, I got the latest Fitbit for Christmas from my awesome hubby. Before Fitbit SURGE I was calculating my calories burned with MyFitnessPal. I've been going to bootcamp and doing HIIT workouts, running, cycling, etc. I'm always very active. But, according to fitbit even my most intense workouts don't burn enough calories. For example. MyFitness Pal said that with 50 minutes of Bootcamp I would burn 500 calories, but my fitbit tells me I only burned 243!! Help! It's so dissapointing. I'm very obsessed, so now I have to run and do someother cardio to burn between 500-600 calories a day. Still trying to lose 5 pounds, but not burning enough calories is depressing me. 😞  Any advice? IS the fitbit correct?
Hi,Does anyone else suffer from PLMD ? My Fitbit One clearly shows it happening.Any ideas, tricks remedies to mitigate it to get a better night's sleep ?Trying Valerian as no contraindications with the drugs I am on ....Thanks,Mark. P.S. Yes I am on some meds for it, but they are addictive, reduce in efficacy over time and have side effects.

Good question, @BraulioFitbit. I prefer solo piano music like George Winston. Pandora offers some nice stations with solo piano. I’ve also followed some similar playlists on Spotify. This simple, soothing music seems to give my brain something to latch on to, blocking out random thoughts and worries. With this playing in my ears via AirPods, I can usually drift off quickly to a restful nap.
I like it!

Where can I find it for me...age 71..woman
Hi @bonnilin, Let's look at how the phone app you're using works, vs. how the tracker detects sleep. Your phone app knows when you're awake, because you're saying "I'm awake".  So it doesn't have to figure anything out--it just goes by what you say. The fitbit is going to look at your motion to determine if your asleep. So if you're laying in bed saying "I'm awake", there's no movement that would tell the tracker you're actually awake. As an example, when I meditate, because I'm sitting mostly motionless, the fitbit will start sleep logging. Sometimes late-night movie watching will trigger it also. I just go into the app and remove the entry. The other solution I've found that works, is when you wake up, actually sit up in bed, or even just wave the arm the fitbit is on around a little bit, so it knows you're actually awake. That's all I know on the subject. Hope this helps.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Definitely not a good sleep pattern. I can see why you'd be tired all of the time.  A good place to start might be to check out Mayo Clinic's article on "7 Steps to Better Sleep" to see if you can improve your sleep habits. Check out the article here: 7 Steps to Better Sleep
Hi Amanda, Yes, I have small bed side lamp.I think it is the computer and TV routine I watch till late which makes me awake and restless.Last night I switch off computer, and TV long before I climb to bed and I had a goo night sleep, only woke up twice to go to the bathroom.My exercise in the morning is Chiqong and Taichi, it's a chinese exercise.In the afternoon, I walk.Night before bed I don't do any, just chill out. Waking up at 6.30am is too early for me, I'm not a morning person. As I don't work, I can allow myself to wake up later than 6.30am.I hope I will sleep like last night tonight. Thank you.
The fitbit community is not intuitive for me and this post may or may not reach anyone.  I was trying to reply to a post of someone who said their HR didn't log sleep last night.  I saw some answers to give a while to catch up.  It's been about eight hours so I don't think it's going to.  Does anyone know why that happened?  In almost six months of fitbitdom, I have not experience anything like that.  Please respond if anyone knows what to suggest.
It would not be hard to add a relay so the thermostat can control your heater. An electrician can easily do this.
Is there a way to add the tile back in and track manually? I can't even track on the website.
Nope.  Doesn't work.  I only see a graph with "sleep stages".  It gives me my time in each stage but no benchmark comparison.
FYI. Bold looks like you are yelling at me

@stendeln  RHR is just that., when you are at a state of rest and still, as detected by your Fitbit..  This link will help explain and your pulse rate is within the guidelines for resting HR. After you sync, what is the RHR on your Dashboard.?. The PC Dashboard is normally 1 bpm higher because of their rounding. @stendeln wrote:My fitbit tells me my resting heart rate is 69 to 71 when I wake up.  I'll monitor my heart rate with the fitbit throughout the day and it ranges from 79 to 98 depending on what I'm doing, But even if I'm at my desk and typing away my heart rate will stay in the high 80's to low/mid 90's. Not sure if sitting, typing and talking on the phone is considered resting but it does bother me that I'm not in high 70's low 80's during this time. I'm 59 years old..

I've compared the results from my app and from my Fitbit Flex and there's not that much of a difference between the two readings at all.In fact, if I have one setting activated on it, the app will record when I'm snoring too.
Welcome beautiful! @dia  definitely agree with you. technology can be awesome if you use for the right purposes but if not it can actually make you loose a lot of time.

Stepping in the U.S.A. since September 2013. Android 9
I gave my 14 year old daughter my FitBit because she has some chronic conditions that really affect her sleep. I was very interested to see the new Heart Rate Variability metric, and the app and research I see says that higher is better than lower. I am having a hard time finding normative ranges, especially for her age... (I have even been looking at scientific papers!) I read that 0-50 was not good, 50-100 was ok, room for improvement- not sure above that? Does anyone have a good resource for this? Thanks!
I regularly have a sleep score of over 90, with 94 being my highest. Even though I average 6:40 hrs sleep a night, much lower than the recommended 8 hrs, which I very rarely achieve. I go to sleep very quickly (I‘m a night owl and always stay up too late!) and have a deep sleep with very few wakings in the night. The really high score over 90 I only achieve if I sleep more than 7.5 hrs which I set as my goal, but only achieve if I have done a lot of excercise, gardening session or a few short nights in a row the day(s) before.

My charge 2 has been working fine for the most part but every so many weeks it gives me the basic information.  But this last Sunday never loaded at all.  I am charging my fitbit now and will try again as a post in 2015 seemed to have the same problem and charging worked but this is the first time ever I have had this issue and I've had the watch over a year..  anyone else experience no downloaded sleep?
I just noticed this month that my sleep scores are no long available and now I have to pay to get them. Very disappointing.  I am now looking at other options outside of fitbit. This has gotten ridiculous...charging for everything.  I have to now download multiple apps to get what one app<fitbit> used to give me.
I keep receiving wrong information about my sleep insights. although I‘m not reaching my sleep goals, I get the „sleeping beauty“ messages nearly every day 🤔 (see picture above).
I have been using my fitbit for about two weeks.  I didn't buy it for myself but when the recipient didn't want it, I decided to keep it to see if I could start understanding the severe insomnia I've developed. My sleep data over two weeks is similar to yours: I have two or three periods of sleep with lots of "restless" stripes and blocks, and one or two "awake" stripes.  Between the periods of sleep, there are periods of an hour and half to over three or even 5 hours when I'm supposedly not asleep at all.  Sometimes that's accurate--during that 5 hour period recently, I really was awake all night.  Other times, I'm puzzled that the Fitbit doesn't think I was asleep, because (a) I don't remember a long period of wakefulness and (b) the heart rate monitor shows my heart rate dropped to 62-64 BPM with some spiking above or below, which is same rate I have during the non-restless sleep periods. Last night, after resetting the watch to "normal" sleep sensitivity, my dashboard shows two blocks of sleep with NO "restless" stripes, except at the very beginning and very end.  (I swear--just looking at those blocks of solid blue is relaxing!)  However, between the two blocks of sleep, I was supposedly awake.  And I wasn't--I was asleep.  I woke up at 3:25 a.m., went to the bathroom and did a couple of yoga stretches at 3:25 am, then fell asleep--as I remember it--right away.  The heart rate monitor says my heartrate fell below 70 and then into the low sixties, with a few spikes to 70 or so, from 3:30 a.m. until 9:20 a.m.  Yet the sleep report says I was awake from 3:25 until 6:11 a.m., and then asleep again from 6:11 to 8:18.  Yet 9:00 a.m., my heart rate was 58 bpm.  15 minutes later I woke and looked at the clock. Bottom line:  I trust the heart rate monitor, but I'm not sure what the sleep report means.  If I'm using the sensitive setting, it appears I am restless a great deal.  Does that mean I'm getting very little deep sleep?  Do I ever get REM sleep?  I can't dreaming, ever.   I'm going to get sleep study soon at an insomnia clinic.  Before I go, I'm going to take a look at how to download reports so that the Doc can perhaps shed some light on what they mean, if anything, and I'll report on that here. I'm glad to see this discussion because Fitbit doesn't provide any help understanding the sleep data, as far as I can tell.
Hello @Patty66, @GG7, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for the troubleshooting steps you've tried prior to posting! 
 
Please note that in order for you to receive a Sleep Score, you must receive Sleep Stages. If you don't receive Sleep Stages, then there are some factors that prevent them to be received. Please consider the following: 
 

If you slept in a position that prevented your device from getting a consistent heart-rate reading or wore it too loosely. For best results, wear your device higher on your wrist (about 2-3 finger widths above your wrist bone). The band should feel secure but not too tight.
If you used the Begin Sleep Now option in the Fitbit app (instead of simply wearing your device to bed). For more information on automatic sleep tracking, see How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
If you slept for less than 3 hours.
If your device’s battery is critically low.

For more information, you can see: What should I know about Fitbit sleep stages?
 
On a side note, @Patty66, I was informed that you contacted our Support Team. Since you have received assistance from them, I recommend contacting the one more time if you have additional questions or inquiries about the outcome of your case. 
 
Hope this helps!

That hour was still recorded. It would not be difficult to add that data onto the front end and evaluate it in the context of sleeping.

I have also seen this very consistently.Resting HR goes up while sick (even with just a mild cold), with an advance notice 1-2 days ahead of onset of symtoms. I've often thought this could make a very useful/interesting feature.
Same here 😞 I grew up with insomnia (since kindergarten) and I finally reached a very low point in my early 20s and went on Ambien and Welbutrin for depression. I ended up taking Ambien for 10 years.  I stopped about a year and a half ago and for the most part I have been getting sleep.  I am tired a good portion of the time though, and on the nights that I am able to wear my fitbit to bed, on sensitive it says I'm only getting like 3 or 4 hours of sleep & that I'm restless most of the night.  I don't know if it's just too sensitive or if I'm really not getting good quality sleep.
My experience has been the same as I also keep a spreadsheet to track each night's sleep.  My biggest complaint is that most nights the versa doesn't get my "bedtime/fall asleep time" correct.  Sometimes it is off by almost 2 hrs.
Carol, I loosened the strap one notch. No changes.I loosened another notch. Still no deep sleep recorded.If I loosen it more, it will slide along arm. Maybe the fact that I do not see deep sleep is a combination of the fitbit algorithm for sleep stage detection and me personally. I usually sleep on my back. I will sometimes fall to sleep on my side, but I always wake up on my back.
I've noticed the same thing a few illnesses ago. That was my worst one in a long time and it made my RHR go up 20+ so it would have been hard not to notice. It always goes up around 5-8 points before onset of symptoms. Obviously I'm sick now 😛
I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia 23 years ago after many years of a sleep disorder after a traumatic home invasion. I've had the sleep study, but was frustrated because it recorded normal sleep that night  As you can see on 6/26, I had great sleep, I dozed off again after getting up at my normal time and had a great night's sleep on 6/26.  Last night though it was worse (although not as bad as some I see here 😞  ), I run a chronic pain group and the Fitbit looks like it could really help some of our members give better information to their doctors.  We are a group that is not giving each other tips on how to apply for social security, we are all there to support each other and to work on living a full functional life with the pain.  I have not been on fibro meds in over 20 years as I researched and found that activity and good sleep were the best things I could do for myself.  Excited to chat with others and hear how their Fitbits have helped them. Thank you
Hi Dave, thanks for your reply however I'm unsure as to wher & what I am supposed to be reading. Do you think it's an issue with the Fitbit?
On phone app display of sleep session, near top right is an icon of 3 little circles, the one on the left connected by lines to each of the other 2; that is the symbol for "share"; tap that and follow prompts.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

I had a sleep study a few years ago and I find the Fitbit to be pretty accurate with what they told me.  I have mine set to sensitive and on the rare occassion it tracked my "watching tv" as sleep but that was only in the first few weeks of using.  It's been 3 months now and hasn't done that for some time.  Or I'm moving more than I realize now.
We have the Charge HR. I've had my 9yo with behavorial issues wearing the fitbit the past 2 weeks to see whats going on with her sleep as I know she's a very restless sleeper. On average her sleep is disturbed 30-40+ times a night and time to fall asleep is 0. I know she's out in 2-3 minutes every night, she's very active during the day and regularly hits 6 miles of activity just playing. She's your classic ADHD kid. She's not on any meds, doesn't eat junk food (she's gluten/dairy free which rules it out for the most part). The wakings looked random until I changed how I was looking at it, probably 98% of the wakings are in group bands. If I started timing from the beginning of 1 grouping to the next its like clock work plus or minus a couple minutes but its every 30 minutes with 1 or 2,  60 minute stretches. Only a couple nights have a 2 hour block. We did see the Dr about it Friday, he's ordering a sleep study and mentioned possibly blood sugar issues causing it but giving her something to stabilize her sugar the past 2 nights hasn't made a difference. The room she's in is quiet, door kept closed and there doesn't seem to be any outside factors that could be messing with her sleep. She's just a very restless sleeper tossing and turning all night, even when she's not moving the fitbit is recording her sleep is disturbed.

Well, that may be true but it is only a calculation. A sleep study is the only way to truly see what your real sleep efficiency is like. It will tell you what stages of sleep you are in most. Although, this device will give you a snap shot of your sleep and may prompt some people to seek help, which is a good thing. Sleep disorders have been linked to more serious helath problems. So, I think these devices are really good to monitor your health and I am sure more is to come in the future. By the way I ran a sleep lab back in the day lets say 70's and the advancements have been remarkable over the years.
A sleep study will help. In the meantime, try a few things in the evenings before going to bed: - no caffiene- try drinking a good mint tea or lemon grass- tire the dog out (to help him/her sleep through the night)- try stretching before bed and definitely after you wake up- when you wake up, try to drink 10 to 16 oz of water (don't chug, just drink it over the first half hour) - your body needs water in the morning Hope this helps.

great work!
How do you wrap the fit bit in the band for the sleep mode?  Mine fell out in the bed last night.  Guess I did not get it correct! LInda
Well it’s mostly about if I can trust the tracker to tell me the truthabout if I’m getting enough deep sleep.
Does anyone else nightly Oxygen variation graphs have small orange spikes on like mine?I'm worried about sleep Apnoea but I have no other symptoms. It’s not every night maybe 3/7 or sometimes a few days without any spikes then a couple of nights in a row with some orange high spikes.Anyone had this and NOT had sleep apnoea?!
@JaimeW From that description, it sounds like you have your tracker set to "Sensitive" mode. If that is the case, I'd recommend setting it to "Normal" instead. This setting will be more accurate for most users, and will probably provide you with better results.
Best of Luck to you!  I hope you get some answers soon.   A CPAP isn't very comfortable, but the benefits can be huge.  Let us know what you find out.

I think your expectations of a $99 pedometer are widly overblown.  A device like this is mainly for keeping the owner mindful (and honest) about their levels of activity, time spent sleeping, etc. It isn't a full blow sleep or physiology laboratory - so we shouldn't expect similar levels of information, accuracy, or precision.
Hello @jules1967  Not sure to understand what is the problem, could you please post some screen capture to illustrate ? To be able to post you need a few more posts, probably 3 or 4, so if you could just post some gibberish 4 times and then post the screen capture showing the issue with your heart rate ?
Considering I just binge watched 8 seasons of Weeds, I am very glad it doesn't consider my TV time as sleep.

My sleep score is usually in the 80s. Last night was 88. I try to stick to my schedule and usually get 8 hours in… And yet, I never wake up feeling rested. I am always tired. Does anyone else have this issue and if so, did you find anything to help?

I would take your sleep data to your doctor they will refer you to someone who can help you out. I think alot of this stuff goes undiagnosed in most people their entire life. These health trackers are just bringing it into the spotlight. But the new  Fitbit SP02 features (sleepscore beta)  coming out will be the real factors that will help you diagnose as it tests the Oxygen in your blood to see if you have momentairly stopped breathing (apnea). I wish you good luck and there is a chance it is only very mild or not at all.  Cheers,

Moderator edit: subject updated for clarity
Is there any way that I can compare my heartbeat to my sleep cycle. My heartbeat seems to be increasing to waking levels at times when I'm certain that I was asleep, and I sometimes wake up with steps on my step counter that shouldn't be there. So I'm either sleep walking or tossing and turning a lot, and I'd like to know whether this coincides with REM sleep or not.

The tracker does well, but if you wanted a more detailed report on your sleep, you'd need to go to a sleep lab.

Hi, where do you find the restoration score? I bought fitbit premium (now in 90 day evaluation period) but I  don not seem to find this data. I do have access to the fitbit coach trainings. But I cannot find the sleep heart rate etc. In the metrics I can see, nothing seems to have changed since my fitbit premium account.  Thanks,Monique
@JudyH123  sorry, but the oxygen data is limited to the Charge 3, Versa and Ionic
I have a One, but I do know that it's just recording movement or lack thereof, not actual sleep. There are times that I'm awake but lying quiet, body mostly relaxed, but definitely NOT asleep.  The next day I check after syncing and it recorded me as asleep.
Hi @Mandyb17 Welcome to the forum. I hope you find inspiration and answers to your questions here. I rarely experience migraines, but do have a lot of headaches and do see patterns of disrupted sleep patterns and low oxygen scores. I'd be interested to hear from other on this topic.

Why would you use vitamins at all? Ask yourself; do I really need any vitamins?If you have deficit, that’s different story. I only use ZMA at night but instead of buying “vitamins” that almost no one knows where they are really made I eat all sorts of vitamins in all vegetables, apples, oranges, pears, grapefruits, spinach… etc.My body is thanking me for my choice everyday. Why spend $ if there is no need?
@Marie_Hgl, thank you very much for your reply! 
 
I appreciate your understanding! Looks like there isn't an available option to read the Sleep cycles like the way you've mentioned. While this isn't yet available, I'd recommend to post this idea in the Feature Suggestions board so our developers can take it into consideration for new updates or product development. Our team strives to improve the Fitbit experience based on our members feedback.

You can’t remove the sleep score from the mobile app. You can, however, see time spent sleeping (including weekly averages) on the desktop dashboard (https://www.fitbit.com/sleep). It works on any device (computer, tablet, phone), but you need to use your browser. I personally find sleep score more useful, I guess you can’t please everyone.

Hi one thing that stands out to me is bedtimes aren't consistent. There may be other factors as to why your not sleeping well.
@Calathea77  I try to keep to a sleep schedule.  While my exact sleep stages will vary from day to day, I seem to get most of my deep sleep in the first few hours after falling asleep.  If I stay up later, I seem to lose out on deep sleep. My time in the different sleep stages almost always falls in the benchmark range for my age.

Hi @iTommyBoy - Another question to ask is - does the snoring stop when you use the CPAP?  I got a CPAP a couple years ago because my husband said my snoring was getting worse. Then CPAP stopped the snoring ... which is good for my hubby. My pulmonologist offered an even better reason to give the CPAP a try. He said that sleep apnea might also increase my risk of heart attack, stroke and abnormal heartbeats, such as atrial fibrillation. Yikes! That was enough to convince me to give the CPAP a good, long try.  Could it be that you need to give your CPAP a longer try? I know it took me a while to get used to sleeping with it but after a while, I found I slept better with it on. Perhaps stop the on-again off-again approach and give yourself a month?
Hello @Imheretowin, let me give you a warm welcome to our Community! 😊
 
A few months ago I used to have the same experience and it is currently caused by some factors like stress, anxiety and worry. For sure, I understand how you feel and I'd like to share some tips that have helped me to improve my Sleep: 
 
1. Stick to a Sleep schedule. 
2. Pay attention to what you eat and drink. Try limiting caffeine intake to just mornings. It is confirmed that the Caffeine can affect your sleep for hours after drinking it. 
3. Limit daytime naps. 
4. Include physical activity in your daily routine. Sometimes it's hard to workout during the day, but doing this will improve your Sleep too. It can help reduce anxiety too. 
5. Keep your bedroom cool. It's easier to fall asleep when the temperature is cooler. But it's too hot, too cold, then it may be difficult.
6. No screens before going to Bed. This keeps the brain active, and makes it hard to slow down for sleep time.
 
Let's see if other users can share with us, the tips they have followed to get a good Nigh's Sleep. 
 
Hope these tips help! 😊

Sleep quality is not subjective. The more natural your alignment of the hips, pelvis, and spine is, the more quality sleep you get. There're many positions that are natural for our system and comfort levels is also what you can't ignore. You mentioned snoring and that's what related to back pain. Sleeping on your back can cause the tongue to relax into the upper airway, increasing snoring risk. If you snore you're very likely to experience relief by switching to side sleeping. I also have back issues and sleeping on the side with a pillow between my knees is so much relief. There're even mattresses which are designed to help you with back pain/snoring and help you get a better night rest. Check the article if you're interested and wish you good health!
@LizFitbit  for me, having a radio on becomes background noise, so I don't hear the washing machine or dryer when I need my sleep! So many people seem to think a tv in the bedroom isn't a distraction, but the light coming from it sure is. I like a mostly dark room, except for my clock. My best sleep seems to be with just the radio on and not letting too many thoughts from the day take over. It's too easy to let the worries of life disturb a much needed good night's sleep. I listen to old radio shows and fade away. I've been able to gauge my sleep and know when I get under five hours of sleep, I'm going to have a rough time of it by afternoon. My best is with seven hours or more of sleep. Knowing what I need helps me understand my energy levels, too. No matter what I do, I am the night owl. If I need to be up early, I can manage it, but I'll revert back to my nocturnal habits.

@TimothyBourner  - I also have the Inspire 2, just got it last week.  Mine does a pretty good job of tracking sleep.  I have severe Sleep Apnea and use a CPAP device and wear a mask all night long.  Still I feel when I check my sleep it seems pretty accurate. One thing I wonder, I noticed somewhere in settings for Sleep, you could set Sleep Sensitivity, to either 'Normal', or 'Sensitive' , have you tried going to the Sensitive setting? I wonder if any others up here could comment on what that setting does for sleep tracking?
I am having the same issue, I had a sleep score a few weeks ago and after an update it seems to have disappeared. I paid money for something that is not working.  I have hard reset my Versa 2 and logged out off the app still nothing. I am a Samsung user. Thanks GG2
Go to www.Fitbit.comLog on at the right side, At next screen enter your name (or email) + your password. enter   Next screen, click "Log" near upper left, then click Sleep.  Your Sleep Efficiency % should in a panel with Zzzzzz     I hope this helps
I’ve been getting odd sleep readings lately, and wondering if anyone has had it happen to them. For instance, last night it shows that I slept from 9:07-10:37, and 9:43-1:05.  This is not the first time it’s happened, and I have tried resetting.
how do i set my flex to sleep mode, and how do i turn it back to walk mode
I will turn off  sleep schedule and see if it works, thanks
do you guys have any advice on how I can get to sleep?
Athough some doctors are starting to look at fitness trackers for medical info, (An ER doc saved a patient based on his Heart Rate data on his Fitbit), most doctors do not think much of fitness trackers when it comes to treatment.  I think the devices are too new, and the data's accuracy is unknown.  They'd probably want to send you to a sleep study before looking at your Fitbit data.  I was able to use my heart rate data, plus blood pressure readings with pulse rate data, to get my doctor to put me a drug to lower my heart rate.  It was always over 100 bpm.  So it really depends on your doctor, and if they are willing to look at the data.  Once you get your medical license, maybe you can use the data in your practice. I find the unexpected knowledge my fitbit gives me is interesting.  For example when I had the flu, my Resting heart rate when up about 8 bpm.  Then it came down back to normal, then went back up a week later when I got a bad cold, then back down when I was recovering, and then back up when the cold turned into bronchitis, started to go down, and now my cold seems to be back as I'm getting sick again.  It's been a a rough few weeks for me...

I'm not getting any sleep tracking information for the last 9 days.  What's up?
Once again fitbit is messing with their CUSTOMERS by requiring additional money to continue to receive sleep data...even though we all purchased the device (Charge HR) in my case because it offered sleep data analysis as part of the program. This is the 3rd time fitbit has played this game with me. Time for me to find a different device. No wonder fitbit is looking for a buyer for the company.
Hi Guys! Have a look here (https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Feature-Requests/More-functional-sleep-data-analysis/idi-p/1195744). What do you think about this function in Fitbit, would you like to have it?
I recently replaced my Charge HR with the Alta HR and even though my sleep patterns haven't changed, I've noticed a dramatic change in the Fitbit sleep tracking data.  Both devices were set to "normal" mode, but the Alta HR indicates a steep decline in hours slept and sleep quality.  There seems to be a difference between the devices.  Has there been any documentation of the sensitivity between devices?
Yes @Jim52 those little dots are when your awake for brief periods. This is normal for most people.

Hello @Tanyatk Welcome to the community forums! @JohnnyRow It's great to see you around and thanks for your input! 
 
Adding to what @JohnnyRow said, all wrist-based Fitbit devices automatically detect your sleep when you wear your device to bed. We recommend wearing your device in a snug wristband while sleeping; don’t wear your device in a clip or pendant accessory. For more information, I recommend visiting the following help article: How do I track my sleep with my Fitbit device?
 
Hope this helps!

Does anyone know of a sleep diary available for download?Many times there has been a format worked out and we won't need to reinvent the wheel.I was thinking of a spreadsheet with 'check off' boxes and places to record sleep info from the Fitbit.Any ideas???
There are a new generation of mattresses using a different business model than the traditional one. You can try them for 100 nights and if you are not happy they pick it up back free of charge. 10 year warranty, delivery at home included in the price. Those mattresses have 3 layers of foam. The first company to do this is Casper, which is US based: https://casper.com/mattresses/casper-essential/ With their success other startups followed. I have one of those, from Tediber. I sleep really well, the support is great (I also do have back issues), it is not warm. Also the materials are designed to avoid propagate movement. If your partness is restless it will not disturbed you.  It is worth looking at those.
Hi! I'm a newbie to Fitbit and love my new Ionic. One thing I don't understand is I've set my fitbit to track my sleep, but if I get up briefly during the night, it tracks me as being awake for the rest of the night? I do go back to sleep and I thought it might record the break but then continue to count the sleep time?  Is there a setting I'm missing? Can anyone help me resolve this? Many thanks in anticipationDave

Fitbit trackers use movement, heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen levels to give you an idea of how much time you spent asleep each night. I often wake up early in the morning and will lie in bed without moving, which Fitbit will track as Light sleep or REM. In some of my sleep graphs, there will be periods showing I was awake, although I don't remember waking up around that time. Apparently, I was moving around in my sleep enough for my Fitbit to log it as being awake. For me, sleep tracking is interesting information. But knowing that I can "fool" my tracker, I don't rely on the values. Instead, it's more important to me on how rested I feel. The Qualified Scientist YouTube channel is one that you might want to check out. He is a scientist and uses various equipment and methods to evaluate the accuracy of popular wearables. Although he has a video where he evaluated the Versa 4, there isn't one for the Versa 3. He did find the Versa 4 good for sleep tracking.

Hi skms, all the colour is handled automatically by Google Sheets' Conditional Formatting. To streamline things, I'm only logging the general Sleep Score, which I'm satisfied is a faithful indicator of all the components. As for October 3, I drove over five hours back from holiday that day through a time zone, and any deviation from routine will upset things.
Completley agree, I purhcased the Jawbone up for that reason, coulnd not stand the design. LOVE my fitbit, but miss the Alarm sleep cycle, with the fitbit I dont wake up like I did to the Jawbone, I dont even wake up to it most of the time, and with the UP I always woke up feeling fantastic!
I have it on my left and it asked me if i had it on my dominant hand and i said yes, so i guess that is right. Yes, my left is what i reach, throw, and use as the dominant. Since i don't write a whole lot anymore except for little notes here and there i guess that I would have to say my left definitely is the more dominant. I didn't see anywhere that i was supposed to have it on the least dominant arm. I would like to read some more info about the setting up process, trying to find it on the web.MaWitters
Average sleep time should be calculated per day, not per how many times asleep.  For example, taking naps should add to the average sleep time, not subtract from your average sleep time.  If Sunday night I sleep 7 hours at night, and take a 1 hour nap Sunday afternoon, my average weekly sleep should be 8 hours per day, not 4 hours per time asleep.
Hi @WilsonFitbit. I used to drink a cup of milk with a little honey and it helped me sleep better.
 
Thanks for the advised foods. This information helps a lot. I'll take those foods into consideration because sometimes it's hard to me to fall asleep.

I tried a tracker that ***supposedly*** measured blood pressure using light.  The readings were on the low side.  If you want/need accuracy, I'd recommend sticking with an actual cuff.
Not sure about that article, as the person says they are better off with 3 hours sleep and a nap than a full 8 hours. That wouldn't work for me!The American Sleep Association says "A complete sleep cycle takes 90 to 110 minutes on average.  This would mean the cycle isn't totally fixed, so using a fixed time for cycles wouldn't work very well. The smartphone apps I've seen that do this measure where a person is in the cycle and wake based on that.It's a very good question how awake time affects overall sleep and the cycles. Since the awake times on my fitbit sleep chart are usually very small, I wouldn't think they'd throw off the cycles too much.

Hi  can’t find how to set my sleep show it shows up on my iPad
1. BMI score is optional and it's not flashing Poor in my face every morning. You can choose when you want to see it, if at all. 2. "Bad news" according to whom?! How the hell you decide who is poor and who is great? Based on what? People have very different needs, patterns, physical conditions and disabilities. And I haven't authorized anyone to make blatant assumptions about mine. I know my needs and if I ever need to be benchmarked, I benchmark myself only to my own needs, my body and my health. And even if I do have a bad day, trust me, I KNOW it myself. I don't want anyone to grade and judge and tell me what I already know and trying to work on. 3. You know NOTHING and these **ahem**s at Fitbit know NOTHING about psychology and motivation if they think that judging and imposing some abstract standards on anyone and telling them they are a failure is a good way to motivate. 4. I already removed the sleep tile from my dashboard, making the device useless for me. Why do I need to pay so much for a simple step counter and some basic period calendar? I know that Fitbit doesn't care, but with attitude to users and their feedback, I'm not buying any new Fitbit ever.
Hi All, I still get very lucid dreams, intermittently. I firmly believe it is due to the flashing light pulses from the heart rate monitor. If the device is not perfectly glued to the skin (I wear it more loose to bed) and you happen to have your Fitbit hand close to your eyes while you sleep, it's easy to see how the flashing lights could affect your sleep. It is easy to see the pulsating, green lights at night. From what I've researched, it is well documented that flashing, high frequency lights cause lucid dreams. This is my strongest hypothesis thus far. See below for one simple reference to light flashes causing lucid dreams, searches in google constantly reference this technique.https://lucid.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Initiated_Lucid_Dream
@Hats26 wrote:Cheers @MDadourian! Yeah.. I certainly pay 100% attention to what my legs are saying when I contemplate a run. I often walk at times if I am feeling a bit shakey and even though I've done a 10k event in a surprisingly well time, I do want to make sure I am injury free. I've not thought about the long term effects of high impact exercise though, however I probably don't do it enough for it to be a problem.  Just joined http://www.5x50.org/ event that starts on Sunday! Went to my first spin class today, which was interesting. I think on the whole it is important to mix high with low impact training. I've done quite well this week with both my circuits, running on cross trainer seems like lowish impact training, spin & swimming on top of run club oh and a body combat class. Next week won't quite go as "exercise smoothly"  thanks to other commitments, but I am skiing this weekend 🙂   The book is quite a good read, only read a small bit, but it certainly helps with the inspiration. Yes, pleased to say my shin issues haven't come back since my vivobarefoot/vibram shoes and I was given different exercises to avoid any strain during sprinting.  Ah thank you, it helps to share the information and hear positive feedback. I just wish I had more time in a day to do more exercise. Hope all is well with you 🙂 I look forward to doing my Park Run 5k again next weekend and see how I get on, but perhaps not to pressurize a PB of 26.23 unless my legs/feet are ready for it. I am often still wondering "Am I running right.." However I had a wee practise on the treadmill when I bought some brilliant earphones (perfect for small ears!) and I was stoked that I was running on the balls of my feet without even focusing too hard on it. YAY. Slowly getting there.. Well @Hats26 it seems as if you have a great plan of action and that to me is very important. You have goals and you are trying new things and paying attention to your body.  I am sure you will continue to make incredible strides and hope you will keep me updated with your journey. Hope you have had an enjoyable weekend and I wish you a great start to your week.

HiIf you are using a fitbit flex it only vibrates when you have done 10,000 steps.I use my wake up alarm daily, so maybe you just haven't configured it right?Give it another tryAnd enjoy the fitbit experience☺
Not sure if this is just Premium, but on phone app under Sleep, tap the 'Deep and REM Tile'.  There is a Benchmark tab showing typical ranges for you age and sex in each sleep type. I don't think anyone gets 50% deep sleep; not me for sure.

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.

Just in the last some days my sleep tracking was no longer on my dashboard. I thought I had accidentally deleted it but I cannot find it anywhere in my app! Thanks a lot! It was useful for me too!
I forgot to set my sleep tracker. When I went to make the entry, I accidentally said I went to bed at 12:30 PM the previous day, instead of 12:30 a.m. I either need to delete the entry and start over OR I need to be able to change the start time of my sleep time. Can the entries be edited?
here's an example - the sleep quality part of the report doesn't match the graph or graph totals/heading
@johnlsummey04 I haven't talk to someone who has taken this pill. What I've read is that modafinil promotes wakefulness by stimulating the brain. The exact mechanism of action of modafinil is unknown. It may work by increasing the amount of dopamine (a chemical neurotransmitter that nerves use to communicate with each other) in the brain by reducing the reuptake of dopamine into nerves.

Yes, I've found much the same thing.. If I wake up at say 5am, but don't want to get up yet, and try to get back to sleep, I guess my heart rate falls even though I haven't resumed sleep, so it interprets that as "light sleep", which alters the Sleep Score.. Still, on only day 3 since buying it, I'm pretty happy with it.. it's helped to explain why my supposed sleep duration doesn't seem to directly correlate to how I feel during the day. EG If I go to bed at 9:30pm and wake up at 5:30am, thinking I've had 8 hours sleep, I'm often more tired than if I wake earlier. The Fitbit informs me that is due to the fact that an hour of that time during the night was spent periodically awake (although I don't really remember.. those moment when you briefly wake up and roll over or whatever I guess!)
If your using an android phone and recently updated alot of people including me  seems to have  lots of yellow spikes, there is some sort of glitch, not sure if that's what you have or not?
Yes, solved. Sorry I didn't update my post. It was two things: battery below 15% blows sleep stages, and less than 2 hrs sleep blows sleep stages.Sent from my iPhone
I am a realy bad sleaper also, seperate bedrooms gives a lot better sleep and much happier in the day. So my husband is used to it now. We cuddle first, and then he moves to the other bed. He is happy to do it now because i am much nicer when i had some sleep.
I have been having problems too.  It will log that I only slept 4.5 hours and the rest will be restless.  Is this b/c it is set on sensitive?  I feel like I get a good nights sleep, but it is saying I am restless almost as much as I actually sleep.  @OCDartist wrote:Hi all I was wondering if anyone was experiencing the same issue as me. I've always been a restless sleeper and after  purchasing the Charge at Xmas it proved it to me in vivid detail. According to the sleep setting (sensitive) I normally average 4 1/2 hrs asleep with 15 - 20 restless periods (perhaps 1 or 2 awake minutes) but the weird thing is that 90% of the restless time periods are exactly 11 minutes! Example last night:11 minute sessions x13 9 minute sessions x 112 minute sessions x 118 minute sessions x 1Example night before 11 minute sessions x 109 minute sessions x 313 minute sessions x 121 minute session x 1 This trend goes on and on ever since I started recording sleep. Now I believe this is either a technical glitch or my brain is super strange (a possibility) but wanted to know if anyone else was recording a lot of 11 minute (or similar duration) sessions or if it was just me.Thanks,James
I have been searching and searching to see if anyone else has experienced this after the past two updates. My RHR has increased a few beats , but nothing has changed. I know RHR changes for certain reasons..... but nothing is any different than before. It was truly freaking me out, thinking something was wrong with me. I am sorry we are experiencing this, but glad it is not just me. I have the Blaze
I never had bedtime reminders turned on and now I get a bedtime reminder every night at 10pm. When I go into the sleep settings all of the options are turned off. So reminders are not even set but I keep getting a bedtime reminder. At this point I am going to delete the app... throw the watch away and go back to the year 2005 when times were simpler. lol

Probably not @lillielil wrote:10  minutes? That seems like a very short timeframe. Interesting... I wonder if it is different if you sent your sleep tracking to sensitive vs regular.
@dustinmassie  I don't believe the data is granular enough to catch sleep apnea. If you suspect sleep apnea I suggest going to a sleep clinic for a sleep study. They can catch instances of stoppage of breathing - how many each hour and the severity of the stoppage on blood oxygen and heart rate.  I speak from experience as my wife urged me to get into a study when she caught me gasping while asleep. I was diagnosed with severe apnea and was on a CPAP for several years. A few years later my wife and I went on a joint diet and I lost about 60 pounds. At that point I found that the CPAP air was keeping me awake instead of helping me sleep. A follow up study showed normal sleep. I was one of the lucky ones where the apnea was a result of being overweight and have not needed the CPAP since.

As I mentioned in my note, this doesn’t work for me. There is no update,just the Open button. I have Fitbit Premium. Does that make a difference?
change the time for your 250 steps to coincide with your nightly nodding and it will prod you every hour to move... I know it isn't perfect, but it should hopefully keep you up. If for no other reason but you anticipating the buzz..

Hi @ForecasterJason, Not totally sure I get your point. I didn't see in the Fitbit article where it defines awake as 30 seconds or more?It's not totally clear how long a waking period needs to be for fitbit to add it as awake time? Or did I miss something? Regardless, what leaves you to conclude that fitbit's tracking of awake time is not accurate? When I look at my sleep chart, I see a couple of awake times that look significant, but mostly they're just tiny dots on the graph. It seems reasonable that a person wouldn't be conscious of those. 20 periods of 30 second awakenings is only 10 minutes, which sounds reasonable to me. @ForecasterJason, could you go into more detail about your post? I'm interested in it.

Thank you, that makes sense. I was expecting better, thinking it would be tracking heart rate with sleep and giving more information.Sent from my iPhone
I have been looking at the iWatch and it’s really nice! But I just bought an iPhone so maybe when I pay that off in 20 years I’ll be able to get an iWatch 😂
To put it simple: A good night's sleep is what you should aim for.You go through several cycles of sleep each night, each cycle lasting about 90 minutes. I think about 1/4 of that time is spent in deep sleep, while about 1/4 is spent in REM (this is also when you dream). It is perfectly normal to wake up or be restless and move around (even if you're not always aware of it) at the end of a cycle.While the body does this on autopilot, there are things you can try if you want to improve your sleep. Mainly this includes reviewing your sleep hygiene and see if you can improve on it.Hope I gave you some of the answers you were looking for.
Setting a daily goal like for steps/floors etc. really motivates me to reach it, I can't find a way to do that for sleep hours, am I missing something?

Why doesn't it combine all your sleep into one segment. If you wake up for 45min at night it starts a whole new graph. Is there a way to fix this?
@shipo Interesting! 
 
Thanks for sharing your experience. I was investigating and it seems that exercising too late in the day, can lead to insomnia, which is the inability to fall asleep at night. But it is also true that Sleeping right after a workout allows the body time to repair and grow muscle tissue.
 
See you around. 

	Wilson M. | Community Moderator, Fitbit.
Yeah, I forgot I had turned off auto update on my phone apps.
I don't understand... How do you know you're not getting to REM?By "have not managed a 90 minute session" does that mean FitBit says you slept less than 90 minutes throughout the whole night?  Or that you don't have a 90 minute "Asleep" block on your graph? That said, I don't understand what you're asking for either.  FitBit can't actually tell if you're in REM, it can only tell if you move or not.  Are you asking for it to highlight blocks of 90 minutes without movement or something like that?
Having trouble understanding how to log sleep.
log on to the fitbit web site.  go to the Log tab, and then sleep tab.  If you set your fitbit to sleep or you started the sleep tracking on the App on your phone, it will have the times already there and give a %.
One thing I would ask is do you have any particular habits before bed? Make a list of anything that comes to mind and perhaps you can pinpoint something that is potentially stimulating your body and not relaxing. Some suggestion will not work for everyone. I for one love to drink chamomile tea at bedtime. That may keep someone else up going to the bathroom. Try 1-2 things a night to see if they help in relaxing you. Keep mixing and matching until you find the right combination for yourself. Of course the suggestion fo avoiding caffeine is always a good one. Sleep is important and in we all must make an intentional effort to get it. You can do it! Don't give up if you have a rough night!
I routinely get less than 60% efficient sleep.  I'm wondering how the sleep is monitored and if this might be a health problem.  I'm thinking of talking to my doctor, but not sure he will think the fitbit reliable information.
I'm such a restless sleeper and always feel tired the next day. Does anyone have any tips to get a more restful sleep?

I have experienced the same problem -- no sleep and missing some metric data for these 2022 dates: 12/7  12/8  12/10  12/11.My Versa 3 is charged and has been rebooted several times.  😣
@Sheilacozad wrote:Can you tell me how do you monitor your cpap machine from your home? Can you do it from your fitbit somehow? How do you score your sleep from fitbit?I'm not sure what you mean by monitoring a CPAP machine.  As for monitoring it from my Fitbit, that is a definite negative. Regarding the Fitbit sleep score, if you have one of the Fitbit trackers with heart rate and O2 monitoring, it is built into the system.
I'm pretty similar--I try to be in bed by 11 p.m. and get up around 5:40 (ugh) to do my exercise. I also sleep later on weekends. I've been taking melatonin because I have a bit of trouble sleeping, and even though my sleep patterns aren't improved, I feel more rested when I wake up. I forgot to take it last night and notice a difference. Maybe our patterns are not the best, but when you have a busy life, what can you do?
It could be that whatever you were doing during the day caused enough vibration to cause your fitbit to go into sleep mode, thus causing the app to say that you were sleeping. It's happened to me on several occasions.
Since the latest software release, if I go to bed at 9pm and wake up at midnight to go to the bathroom and go back to sleep - my log shows either: I slept from 9pm-midnight only OR I slept from midnight until I woke up. In other words, it loses part of the log.If I try to fix it manually by adding a sleep log, it automatically knows the times but I still have to add and it shows like I slept in two sessions.Before I had never had a problem with sleep log. I faithfully look at the sleep log since it's something important to me. Does anyone else have this problem? Is it being fixed soon?

There’s a name for an unhealthy obsession with achieving perfect sleep: orthosomnia. It was coined by researchers from Rush University Medical School and Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in a 2017 case study published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine. This insomnia usually happens because the user gets to hung up on checking their Fitbit data, rather than relaxing.Here is one users experience . As several users pointed out, the first thing they do is check their sleep score. The tracker, instead of being a tool, has now become a mini god and the user is nervous trying to make the tracker happy. This of course will add frustration and cause sleep problems.

I just got the flex.  It seems a lot harder to get it in and out of sleep mode than with the Force.  I just checked mine this morning to see how long I slept cause I kept waking up last night....and sure enough I didn't take it out of sleep mode like I had thought.  It is harder to figure out than the force.  I suppose I will get used to it eventually.
I'm not receiving either.
Also, told and plmd are related to low ferritin levels. Ferritin is how iron is stored in the body. You can test normal for iron levels and not be considered anemic. Ferritin can still be extremely low without the diagnosis of anemia. Many women experience increased restlessness around their period which coincides with a dip in ferritin. I would consider adding iron supplements if your labs show low normal ferritin because you are menstruating...
It's based on movement, so if you're completely immobile while trying to fall asleep, it may think you are actually snoozing.

Oh good lord!  I use Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock for the android along with my Fitbit Flex and I don't sleep with my phone on my bed because I'm afraid that the phone would end up creating a fire hazard.  I have a Samsung S3 and I have seen pictures of these phones once they've overheated.  Not willing to chance it personally.  I have a shelf right by my bed that I put the phone on to charge the phone and I'll run the app while I'm sleeping and the phone is charging.  The app is definitely accurate in tracking my sleep.  The Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock is just as accurate as the Fitbit app in tracking my sleep.  Data has been the same for each app within a minute or two. Just putting in my two cents here.  Take it for what it's worth. Cindy
Thanks. Seems this was nothing to worry about. In deep sleep, my heart rate drops quite low, around 55bpm, my average heart rate varies between 67 - 73bpm. Sleep has been an issue, although its starting to improve as I get better. I do get the odd night, where I simply cannot sleep, and feel absolutely pants the following day, but thankfully these are quite rare now. They are usually caused when I get anxious about something, or overthink something.I still go to bed very early, as I get so tired still, but am a lot better and try to walk at least 3 times a week, on the other days I do strength training, stairs, putting shopping away, housework.I'm still a good few months from running, but on my walks I can do a short burst of slow jogging for 30 seconds!
@RachelMary:... have already been taking a combined calcium + vitamin D supplement for the past couple of years, ... Maybe I need to give the melatonin a try, I haven't considered that ... Thanks ...Great. Also we forgot the most important sleep enhancer - exercise. If we get our heart rates up to the target range for a sustained period of time, it establishes the resting heart rate at a lower rhythm. So it makes sleep more worthwhile! Good luck with it! B"H.

Hello @cooleymax! I don't have an answer as to why that is happening to you. However, I can share my experience.
 
I used to had very bad sleep nights, waking up twice each night and feeling tired the next day. Also, not able to sleep early or the fall asleep at all! So, I discovered that stress and anxiety were the reasons why (I was going through a very hard period of change in my life). That resolved the difficulty to fall asleep.
 
I was still feeling tired and waking up in the middle of the night. So, I thought about my bed... I was using that bed for some years and the bed wasn't good anymore. So, I changed everything! I changed my mattress and changed pillows to more comfortable and modern ones and started to sleep.
 
Within a week I was feeling so much better. No back pain, no tired feelings, and I started to sleep better and now I rarely wake up in the middle of the night. I think I was just unconformable on my bed that made me wake up at night. 
 
There are other times now that I know I am under stress because of a college test or anything, those days I wake up in the middle of the night more often, but I'm sure it is because of the stress for that week, then everything just goes back to normal.
 
Hope this helps you out! I'm sure other users will reply as well and you will get some good help from this Community!

I cut out caffiene and refined sugars from my diet for the last few days and have had a couple of the best nights sleep i've had in ages - not waking once during the night. I've had a coffee today, so will see how well i fare tonight...I think the amount of food you eat also has a big effect too - eat too little and you can't sleep, eat too much and you're uncomfortable (so can't sleep). A meal loaded with carbs will usually give you a good nights sleep too.
My sleep profile says I sleep 7 hours and 19 min and that is above the ideal range and therefore not ideal. The recommended amount of sleep is 7-9 hours. How and why is the low end of that considered too high to be ideal for the sleep profile? Including screenshot Side note, I contacted chat twice regarding the issue. First time they didn't understand what I was saying and was trying to actually troubleshoot my watch, which is reporting the correct info. Tried to send a screenshot, wouldn't work, chat disconnected. Second time agent gave me something to try to fix the screenshot issue which caused the chat to end again and they can't connect you to a previous chat so I just gave up and came here.
Son of a gun. . .that is exactly what has been going on with me, but I didn't make the connection.  I couldn't figure out why my "resting" HR was fuctuating.  And I did notice that what they call my resting HR is not my actual resting HR.  I think it is a calculation that works with the other heart rate levels rather than an actual basal metabolism rate.

Any alcohol before sleep can raise your heart rate.  Occasional spikes I wouldn't worry about, but if your resting heart rate is continuing to go up I might make a trip to your family doctor.  Although it can be stress related it can also be a sign of illness (ie. being worn out, needing a rest).

You can set wake up alarms on your tracker by day and time, not by duration. I hope I understood your question properly...

Are you talking specifically the web app, mobile app, or both?  I was kind of hoping for a sleep cycle bit too, but have been able to see the details in the mobile app.  The bar graph in the web app is kinda useful, but I'm not sure on it's accuracy.
Hey everybody, I recently exported my FitBit data (specifically my sleep score data) and saw some "Scores" I didn't understand. Does anyone know what the "composition_score" is? There is also a "revitalization_score" which sounds self explanatory, but I'd love to know how it is calculated.
Then it must be different depending on the type of tracker. Thanks! All my friends with trackers that track sleep have iPhones.
This is frustrating. It has to be a glitch. Mine does the exact same thing around 1:30am. It will look normal in the morning, but after I do an exercise during the day, it ads a dramatic spike at 1:30am for that day. It has been doing this since the active zone update.
Thank you! This was what I was asking and also what I assumed was the case. I'll have to decide which is more important to me. Or maybe alternate weeks or something.
I have the same issue. Have had it on normal for years, but was tired of it showing I had slept 8 hours and missing all the times I woke up. So I switched it to sensitive a few weeks ago and now I average 4 - 4/12 hours, which I know is much lower than what I actually sleep. Sleep tracking, at least for me on both settings, has been very inaccurate. I know I wake up a lot, and was relying on this part of the app to help me identify my sleep pattern but it's too inaccurate to do that. Seems like adding a meeting setting would be appropriate and be the 'new normal'.
When I manually set my sleep log hours today, the fitbit told me my end sleep was before my start sleep. But I was careful to record start as [11:30 pm, previous day], and end sleep at [8:00 am, same day]. I tried it a few times with the same result. Does this thing make mistakes and if so how do I overcome that?I use the Flex. thank you

That was very likely just spurious data that Fitbit discarded as such. Optical HR sensors can generate a lot of false data like this so smoothing filters are used to discard many of those bad readings. Even then, some still slip through. Fitbit and cardiogram bothmlikely use different filtering algorithms; it wouldn't surprise me at all that the spurious readings that do slip through are in different locations between two different apps. I read an article that I believe was done by DCRainmaker where he compared raw optical HR sensors data to the much more accurate chest strap-style HR sensors. The raw data from the optical sensors was an almost indecipherable mess compared to the raw data from the chest straps. However, once some smoothing filters were applied, the data from the optical sensors was a much better match to the data from the chest straps with only an occasional spurious reading here and there.
Last summer I decided to relocate to Ontario from Windsor. The moving truck from Windsor and loaded all our stuff into moving boxes. I was also trying to help them by lifting the boxes which require extra care. but suddenly I felt dizzy. It didn't away. I had to lie on the floor. I felt like the head is spinning. After some time it was gone. I didn't experience like that for the rest of the week. Later after moving to Ontario, I experienced it a couple more times. I showed it to a doctor, after the diagnosis he concluded that I had cervical vertigo and it's becoming severe. I was to wear a neck collar for some time and gave me some medicines. Since that day I started experiencing a fear to go out alone and to go to big heights. Can someone suggest any solution for this.

Light striking the body, not just the eyes, can disrupt melatonin production.So my question.Do the two flashing green lights on the back of the fitbit (mines a charge HR) result in a disruption to melatonin production, and if so does that mean wearing my fitbit while sleeping will actively disrupt my normal sleep pattern?That's a bit of a strech. You may want to (if you haven't already) read up on blue light effect on sleep,like using computers or watching television within a couple of hours of sleep. http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side
Mine too..... Did anyone get any resolution on this??
The 3 hours is to get sleep stages.One hour should be cutoff to get sleep recognized without stages.  It should have been recognized.  I have seen naps between 1 and 3 hours recognized but I guess sometimes it misses it, maybe if you were particularly restless and wrist moving.

I've read a few threads about this but wanted to add my experience. I just charged my flex after a year of having it stored in a box in the closet. I have been wearing it for a week now and took a look at the sleep data. It has invented data for the last 4 months, including time awake and time restless. This causes me to question the validity of the entire sleep tracking piece. If data was generated for the last 4 months, while it was in storage with no charge in the battery (no vents blowing on it, no movement, nothing), then how can I believe it now? And the time restless and time awake?
Yes, breakdown of total score between "Time asleep" (50/100), "Deep and REM" (25/100) and "Restoration" (25/100) is premium only. I’m based in Finland and I have access to it, so it’s not like it’s a US-only feature for the time being (as has been the case for some other features that were rolled out first for US users).

Sorry may be stress and worry.   Family, Job, lack of sleep.   I have been there many times myself, sometimes with little or no sleep.   I took medication but it only worked for a short time.   Use your fitbit I do not think it is totally acurate, but I was surprized that I was getting sleep I did not know about.  Take care lets walk more and perhaps sleep better.
The image here is what about half my nights look like. Despite having a sleeping heart rate of 51 bpm and sometimes less, I lose a lot of points to the Restoration score, due to this being above my RHR.Fitbit measures my RHR usually between 48 and 52.How much of a health issue is this, and what lifestyle or health factors might be contributing to it?

Based on experence I would suggest a sleep study.  The fitbit will give you a high level idea of what's going on but cannot detect the fine level of brain activity while you are asleep. It records when you move around while sleeping.   I am bipolar and have taken lots of different meds over the years.  While taking citalapram (Celexa) I  could not stay awake.  Could not stay awake at work  and nearly fell asleep driving a few times, which was scary.  A sleep study showed that my brain waves indicated that I was "rousing" about every 3 min through the night, which is basically coming near awake.  No wonder my sleep was not restorative.  Upon eliminating the Celexa my sleep patterns improved very quickly.  I find that I still need a solid 8 hours of sleep, but my doctor assured me that everyone is different and that's just normal for me.  The important thing is that I'm able to wake up not feeling tired all day.  I've had I couple other issues with SSRIs, but this was the worst.  Ask your doctor to order a sleep study.
Did you find out how to get sleep stages back? I'm having the same problem.
The last 2 nights my FitBit HR has not tracked my sleep and I made sure it's charged and that I'm wearing it on the same part of my wrist I always wear on it on. My old FitBit Flex I started to have problems with it doing the same thing but I just got this one for Christmas. Why is it not showing me my sleep? And what can I do about it if I've already rebooted it as the instructions show to do?
Is there any way to dim the luminosity during nighttime? Because when I'm sleeping, and my wrist hits that certain position, the bright light comes on and wakes me up. It even wakes my wife up sometimes. It's so bad, I don't want to wear it to bed anymore.
I notice the same thing, although it's more pronounced on mornings when I wake up to a spike in anxiety... kind of an "oh, this again" response.  The spike isn't as noticeable on weekends or vacation days.  Do you feel a lot of stress around waking up?
Yeah - this is driving me nuts… did you find a way to stop the reminders apart from stomping on the dratted thing?
Hello @hawkmeister, welcome to the community forums! Thank you for your input! 
 
@pwung0327, currently, it is expected that when you wake up or get up at night your Fitbit device will stop recording your Sleep Activity, therefore; your Sleep stages. When you go back to Sleep, then it might start a 2nd Sleep log but take into consideration that this happens when your body is completely at rest and you haven’t moved for about an hour, your Fitbit device records that you’re asleep.
 
As a workaround, on the Mobile Fitbit App, you can begin a sleep log by going into your Sleep tile and clicking on the plus (+) sign. Choose “Begin Sleep Now” and then whenever you wake up, just click on the “I’m Awake” button to stop logging. Therefore; this options prevents Sleep Stages and Sleep Score to be received. 
 
Thank you very much for your feedback! 
 
See you around.

Like negligible deep sleep. Which is funny because I think my sleep disorder typically results in much MORE deep sleep than necessary. This is just an example from last night
How do you guys get this info? I see sleep stages but not this efficiency thing...

I agree completely, I have been getting sleep scores in the upper 70’s and 80’s then a random 50 (where I got 8 hours of sleep and all of my sleep stages were in the optimum ranges). Hmmmm, doesn’t make sense. Way to start your day after looking at that and then anticipating having a “bad” day.
I have amazon music so I downloaded "Weightless" by Marconi Union. If I can't sleep I just put that on repeat, about as loud as white noise. It helps a lot. On bad nights I take Advil PM.
The sleep score is scientifically inaccurate, demoralizing and not actionable! I have the ability to change the number hours of sleep, when I go to sleep, etc. but the sleep score is useless information generated by an arbitrary formula. Give us the option to opt out of sleep score and remove it from our app so that we can see the hours slept and sleep cycles again (which is scientifically accurate and provides actually actionable data). If this is not fixed, I'm moving to Garmin, which has a scientifically valid platform.
Same here.  Doesn’t seem to sync.  Any luck on your end?
2nd night in a row.   I was in bed at 10:30 p.m., lights out, asleep in a few minutes.  This morning the Inspire shoes sleeps time as 11:40 p.m. The wake up time (around 6:30 a.m.) seems to be spot on.
Wsh a fit bot personal would read these posts and address the problem!

I'm thinking I should stop, as my sleep seems to be my main focus now, and the hours I'm asleep are declining over the weeks I've had it.  I think I'm focusing too much on sleeping well and my subconscious knows it. I already am an early riser, but woke at  4am today wanting to cry.  I should just let myself sleep how my body wants to, and not dwell on it.
Hello everyone. 😊
 
How are you today? 
 
Everyone has the occasional bout of insomnia, but when you're tossing and turning at 3am, knowing that "everyone goes through this" is small comfort. What you need to know is what to do. Should you get up, or stay in bed?
 
Here are some tips to help you decide what to do when you can't sleep.
 
When Should You Just Stay in Bed?
 
If you've woken up in the middle of the night, it's often a good idea to stay in bed, at least for a while. Waking up in the wee hours of the morning is quite common, and often all you need to get back to dreamland is to just lie there quietly. If you choose to do this, it helps to think about something pleasant, like a favorite memory or a place you find relaxing, like a mountain meadow or peaceful beach.
 
When to Make Yourself Get Up: 
 
If you've been struggling to nod off for more than half an hour, it's often best to get up. That doesn't mean, however, that you've given up for the night. Getting up can actually help you get back to sleep. By getting up and moving around, you can stretch your muscles to relieve tension and get your mind off your worries. Then, once you feel sleepy again, you can go back to bed.
 
How to Stay Up: 
 
What you do once you've decided to get up is crucial to helping yourself begin to feel tired. Don't turn on any bright lights or use a computer or a cell phone. The white light emitted by electronic devices mimics that of a daytime sky, telling your body it's time to be awake when it isn't.
Instead, turn on a dim reading lamp. Avoid any activities that might be upsetting, like scary movies. Instead, do something that will hold your attention without being over-stimulating, like reading a well-known book, doing a crossword puzzle, listening to soft, soothing music, or doing some gentle stretches.
 
Everyone knows a great mattress leads to better nights of sleep, but little know that it also makes getting up that much easier. Wake up rested, healthy, and ready for the day; get your brand new mattress and sleep on it tonight. 
 
I wonder what do you do when you can't sleep? Would you like to share some insights? 
 
See you around.

@MarciM: I've figured out why it isn't tracking - it's because I was manually turning on my sleep tracker!  It's fine now.  Thanks.
Hi @annie1995 and welcome to the forums! Good question. I’ve personally found that my heart rate spikes correspond to the times I get up to use the restroom. Also, and I’m older than you so it may not apply, but I’ve noticed that my nighttime heart rate is normally higher than my resting HR when my arthritis is acting up and my sleep is more restless. A google search suggests other possible reasons but ask yourself ... are you consuming caffeine or alcohol too close to bedtime? Have you tried using the Fitbit Relax app before bedtime? That could help. Of course the best answers will come from your Doctor. If you are concerned, track your HR differences and bring them to your next appointment.  I’m moving your question to the Sleep Well forum where you may get more suggestions/answers.
@SteveH wrote:Distance is calculated simply by multiplying steps taken by your stride length. As your step counts seems ok, the issue must be with your stride. Fitbit uses defaults for walking and running strides based on your profile settings (height and gender). If the defaults are in use then it's worth checking that your profile settings are ok: https://www.fitbit.com/user/profile/edit You will also see the stride lengths on this page - if they are zero the defaults are in place. If they are not zero then they sound wrong. This article helps you sort them out: http://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/How-do-I-measure-and-adjust-my-stride-length/Is the "stride length" in fitbit, your step length (which is from one foot to the next) or is itactual stride length (which is from one foot to the same foot again) which is twice as far?The instructions mix them up (at least they mix the wording up) which is inexcusable.
I guess the only thing I can recommend is to restart your tracker and see if that works.

I recently had this problem after a software upgrade to my FitBit Alta HR. (I used to have really curvy graphs and now I have blocks of restlessness... and I *thought* I actually felt like I was getting restful sleep because I wasn't consciously waking up as much) After reading some of the other forums I am going to adjust my settings to less sensitive and see if that helps.
Similar experience here. I forgot to put my Flex back on after charging it before bed. The next morning I woke up feeling more refreshed than I had in weeks.  Out of curiosity, I've been taking it off at night for a few nights now and same thing - I'm feeling less exhausted.I haven't been bothering putting it in sleep mode, but I think I'll do what others have shared - put it in sleep mode and set it bedside, so I'm at least tracking when I go to bed for the night and get up for the day (since that is one area of self-sabotage.) edit:  Oh, and generally speaking, having my Flex on my non-dominant wrist doesn't bother me the slightest.
How wide is your bed? Has it got a single mattress or two separate ones? Maybe you can "test-drive" a wider bed in some nice hotel and see if it makes any difference?

Hi I was playing with the sleep tracker (Normal vs. Sensitive) and am beginning to understand the differences.  But then, I thought I'd try switching my sleep to the Activity Tracker (another option on that page of the log screen).  Now, I am not tracking sleep anywhere... How can I go back to where I was? Thanks
Those are great suggestions @Audrey12345 . I think with how hard it can be to turn off our minds, these suggestions can for sure help.

You should probably discuss this with your doctor, but in the meantime I really like drinking "Natural Calm" which is a magnesium drink. It helps me sleep and I love the cherry flavor - I drink it warm at night and it's like a dessert without sugar. Good Luck!
Really were do he happen
oh thank you so much!! That sleep score is meaningless and I prefer to know average hours for the week
Hi @HereAgain & @Wrigley1122 I'm sorry to hear both of you are having issues. I've been seeing similar posts and a factory reset seems to be fixing the issue.  First try restarting it and then if that doesn't work, move to a full reset.  Restart Charge 3If you can’t sync Charge 3, or if you have trouble with connected GPS or trackingyour stats, you can restart your tracker from your wrist. From the clock face, swipeto Settings and tap About > Reboot Device.If your tracker is unresponsive:1. Plug the charging cable into the USB port on a computer or a UL-certifiedUSB wall charger.2. Clip the other end of the charging cable to the port on the back of the tracker.The pins on the charging cable must lock securely with the port.3. Press and hold the button on your tracker for 8 seconds. Release the button.When you see a smiley face and the tracker vibrates, the tracker restarted.Restarting your tracker reboots the device but doesn't delete any data. Erase Charge 3If you want to give Charge 3 to another person or wish to return it, first clear yourpersonal data:On Charge 3, open the Settings app > About > Clear User Data.

Thanks for posting, @wtksk8r!  Makes improving sleep time and quality all that more important!  Especially for us heart attack survivors who would like to prevent another one.
How would the FitBit know the difference between your sitting to read or watch a movie and sleeping? The tap method works well enough for me and my Flex. You having trouble with sleep mode?

Just got the charge 5 and wanted to compare it to wellue's o2ring for heart rate and spo2 sleep readings.Fitbit shows you your oxygen variation and also an average o2 for the whole night.. but what about the actual spo2 % reading throughout the night?Someone referred to it in another post, but I can't find it anywhere in the app. Seems odd that it wouldn't be included, given the fitbit has the technical ability to provide it.

I'm 52 and my resting rate is usually 80, i feel fine and have low wieght. So I wouldn't worry, your in the accepted range.
sorry about that a posted the same topic.
For me the one thing that has been making my life a nightmare for sleep is Tamoxifen ... and I have to be on it for 9 more years.  The only thing that can counter it is Lorazepam, but I try to not take that unless it's midnight and I'm still awake. Sometimes, something that helps me to sleep is to do a bunch of little housework when I get home (small activities where I'm running around the house like a mad-woman) to exhaust me physically.  Things like start a load of laundry, get the coffee ready for the next morning, fill the humidifier in the bedroom (hubby snores less when the humidity is higher), get lunches started ... that kind of thing.  Then, closer to bedtime I grab a book and READ.  This is practically a no-fail way to get me to sleep (now *staying* asleep is a different issue!) Oh side note:  I get up at 4:15-4:30am every morning, and am practically *FALLING* into bed by 9pm - but there are nights that sleep still eludes me because of that stupid medication *grrrrrr*
Perfect!!!  Whew!!  Thanks!
Hi there- I am looking to hear if anyone has their child wear their fitbit at night to track sleep? My daughter (10 y/o) had mono a year and a half ago and the only thing we could do was get her good night sleeps.  We had thought she was getting decent sleeps, but started to track her using our fitbit over the summer.  She generally shows about 91%-93% efficiency but shows a ton of restlessness and minutes awake and has red eyes and seems tired in the mornings.  The last 4 days of restlessness have been 36, 37, 27, 32 times restless, and 43, 57, 58, 55 minutes awake. Anyone track their child's sleep so I can compare? We are concerned that she is too restless!  Thanks in advance for your advice...
This is very interesting @JeanetteLH. Thank you so much for sharing this information with us.

@Shrug I will fall straight into deep sleep after a couple of days of bad sleep, I think because I'm exhausted. How do you even access these forums on the mobile app? I've never been able to find a way...

Allie
I've never gone to a sleep clinic but my dad has. He took in his Fitbit sleep reports and the reports he got from an app he uses called Mobile Sleep Doc (http://www.mobilesleepdoc.com/) that, along with the Fitbit stats, first alerted him to the possibility of having sleep apnea. Turns out he actually does have sleep apnea and his doctor took his complaints more seriously because of the info he could provide.
I keep my FitBit One on me at all times, when I go to sleep I clip it to the band on my shorts instead of the wrist band.  Are the sleep measurements still accurate with me wearing it this way? Any thoughts? According to FitBit I usually average about 4 to 4 1/2 hours of sleep.

I just needed it. Thanks for sharing.
Good morning, I've only been wearing my fitbit ionic for 2 days (love it already), but on recording my sleep on the first night it showed a graph with the sleep stages, for some reason on recording my sleep last night it will only now show the data as a sleep pattern, I like the sleep stages? why did it change? Could somebody explain this to me please, I'm really driven to improve my sleep! x
My fitbit used to show the time of deep sleep (ie total sleeping time less time awake/restless). This morning it shows only the total sleeping time, and I have to deduct the time awake/restless from it to find out the time I enjoyed deep sleep. What went wrong?  I do not fancy doing it every morning!
 
Moderator Edit: Clarified subject
Hi @FidRewe When you tap on an alarm in the alarm app on the device and swipe to see more options for that particular alarm, do you see the smart awake option?  It is located under each specific alarm you have set-up.
In the app, it should show up when you go to the sleep data for a particular day. Under Sleep Stages, there's a tab that says "Benchmark".
What I will do tonight is log on to sleep mode manualy tonight and see what happens will keep you posted...
Hello,  Can you use fitbit as an alarm to wake you up?  I remember hearing from a friend that with certain devices you can program them to wake you up at the most appropriate time during your sleep cycle and that it will vibrate as an alarm  thanks,
@Dreamwalker We recently updated our help site, which is why you're seeing that error. You can safely proceed via the link at the bottom of the page.
Mone just disappeared too. It shows up on my fitbit, but the tab in my app is gone. ???  Ugh. I want those reports while I'm going through health stuff.. Did you ever resolve the issue?
I also see no Breathing Rate data in the app.. I have the Fitbit Sense.
Welcome to the Forums, @JAMCQ.
 
Thanks for taking a break from stepping and for sharing the issue you're having with your Fitbit. Have you see the information here: How do I track my estimated oxygen variation in the Fitbit app? If you already restarted your Fitbit, please feel free to write to our support team.

Well, the explanation is found in the breakdown. This is the breakdown of the longer sleep rated 83:   Here is the breakdown of the shorter sleep rated 84:  I got a lower partial score for the shorter night (42 vs. 46), as one would expect. However, I got a far better restoration score on the shorter night, for spending 94% of the time below RHR, vs. only 48% during the longer night. What I don’t quite understand is why I got the same partial score of 20 for "Deep and REM" in both cases, in spite of having nearly twice as much deep sleep during the longer night. Regardless, I find the sleep scores make sense overall, when you look at the breakdowns.

I think @ZolliStar nailed it with the response. It could be any of those things that is messing with you feeling rested in the morning. It could also be that whatever the day holds is draining you before you even start the day. It is amazing how our mind controls our body. I think you should talk to your doctor and get some really good advice about what to do next. Is it quality of sleep or is it physical or is it mental? they can help you sort through it... sweet dreams..

To be clear... I recorded (by other means) the times when I lay down and got back up again.  I did sleep during at least part of that interval (and also briefly got up a couple of times).  I wanted to log the times when I lay down and got back up again, just to have a record.  But the app both SHOWS the time as blank and tells me that a sleep log already exists for that time.  I have screen shots, but the forum is not allowing me to post them.
I have wondered the same thing. I wear tight enough that it should make contact BUT I may be shifting during the night. My sleep position may be the issue in that I'm pushing the Sense to the side of my wrist while hand is under the pillow. This will affect contact. Will keep experimenting. Possibility of duct tape to side of bed.....
Funny you should say this @AnneMargar!I was thinking about other forms of challenges only this morning. As great as the step challenges are, how great would it be to have other options.Most active minutesBest sleep as you suggestedEven month long challenges for weight loss That would be fab!

Hey Community!
 
We have three exciting new sleep features to announce today: sleep stages, sleep insights, and bedtime reminders on your tracker. You’re sleeping for about a third of the time you’re wearing your Fitbit tracker, so we’re eager to provide even more information about those hours!
 
Sleep Stages
Sleep stages are an important part of your night’s rest because your body and mind recover as you cycle through these stages. If you have Fitbit Alta HR or Fitbit Blaze, simply wear your tracker to sleep and open the Fitbit app in the morning to see a record of your sleep stages. Sleep Stages will be available on Charge 2 at a later date. 
 
This is a top feature suggestion that has gained over 1500 votes in just over a year, and we've been hard at work building this feature. Sleep stages bring additional information to our sleep tracking feature so you can see how much time you spend in light sleep, deep sleep, or REM sleep each night. Here’s a little bit about each stage.:
 
Light sleep: 
Light sleep promotes mental and physical recovery and serves as the entry point into sleep each night as your body unwinds and slows down.
Deep sleep: 
Deep sleep promotes physical recovery and aspects of memory and learning and typically occurs in the first few hours of sleep.
REM sleep (or Rapid Eye Movement): 
The stage associated with vivid dreams, REM sleep has been shown to be important to mood regulation, learning, and memory.
 
You’ll also likely notice awake minutes throughout the night, as a typical adult may wake up anywhere from 10 to 30 times at night. You might not remember waking up since you likely fell right back asleep, especially if you were awake for less than 2-3 minutes at a time.
 
Learn more by visiting our Sleep Stages Blog article here!
 
Awake, light sleep, deep sleep, and REM Sleep are represented by different colors in your sleep stages graph.
 
Your sleep stages graph will show the time spent in each stage during the night, your 30 day average, and a benchmark of where you fall in comparison to people of your same age and gender.
 
-Today: This is the breakdown of your sleep stages for the previous night.
-30 Day Avg: This is the average amount of time spent in each sleep stage over the past 30 days (or, if you don’t have 30 days worth of Sleep Stage data, it will give you an average over however many days you’ve logged using Sleep Stages).
-Benchmark: This compares your data with that of other people in your same age range and gender. Keep in mind that everyone’s sleep patterns vary, and you may notice your sleep data falls outside of this typical range from time to time. If you have any concerns about your sleep patterns, please consult your doctor.
 
For more detailed help content, check out our help article all about Sleep Stages.
 
Sleep Stages FAQ:
Will I be able to have both Sleep Stages and Sleep pattern on my app, or toggle back and forth between both? 
Although you won’t have the option to toggle back and forth between Sleep Stages and Classic Sleep, there are a couple of different instances where we may not be able to gather enough info for a stages log, and therefore you may see a sleep pattern graph. For example, if you slept less than three hours, you’ll receive a classic log. You also might see classic sleep if you slept in a position where your tracker couldn’t detect your heart rate.
 
Will my past sleep logs show sleep stage information? 
No, your past sleep logs won’t contain sleep stages but you’ll continue to see your sleep pattern (time spent awake, restless, and asleep).
 
Can I see sleep stages on my fitbit.com dashboard? 
Yes! You'll be able to see your sleep stages by clicking the sleep tile on your fitbit.com dashboard.
 
Can you tell me if I have sleep apnea or another sleep disorder? 
Your sleep stages data helps you track your patterns and notice variations. If you have any concerns about your sleep health we recommend sharing the information with your doctor. A good source of additional information is the National Sleep Foundation.
 
Sleep Insights 
Have you ever wondered how to improve your sleep, but don't know where to start? We’re here to help! Sleep insights in the Fitbit app are little tidbits of information and suggestions that are based on your personal sleep data. The more sleep you log, the more insights you’ll receive as we base some of your insights off of your sleep data.
 
Bedtime Reminders on Your Tracker 
This is Bedtime Reminders taken a step further to help you get to sleep on time. If you track sleep sleep with Fitbit Alta HR you’ll receive a bedtime reminder on your phone and on your tracker. Bedtime reminders will be available on Charge 2 at a later date. Check out our help article for detailed information on how to set a reminder!

I get on average three/night and the gap on some is only 1 minute. Because I export the data and only one record exports I edit the records. In my case I delete the 2 youngest records and then I edit the first record to show the correct sleep period. All is correct then, because you were wearing your Fitbit. Give that a try. Try that.

How did you figure it out? I'm having this problem
If you go to settings, you should be able to change the setting to sensitive. See if that improves what you are getting as sleep. I will tell you that when I lay reading or watching TV, I guess I am so still that my tracker will record it as sleep as well. Oh if only 🙂 

Elena | Pennsylvania
@Laurennicole87 welcome to the Fitbit Discussion boards 🙂
 
If you feel like the settings on your Flex are too sensititve to movement, your sleep settings may be set on "Sensitive" instead of "Normal" (Normal is appropriate for most users).
 
To change your setting in the Fitbit iOS app, go to Account > Advanced Settings > Sleep Sensitivity. To change your setting in the fitbit.com dashboard, go to Settings > Devices > scroll down to Sleep Tracking.
 
Thanks @Marcy for your input. As a side note, if your tracker is picking up sleep time while you're reading before bed, you can edit your sleep log to note when you stopped reading, and went to sleep. Check out this article about how to edit a sleep log!
 
I hope this helps the both of you - let me know how it goes!

From having occasional difficulty sleeping to insomnia, there is a lot you can do to get a better night's sleep, feel refreshed when you awake, and remain alert throughout the day. It's called "sleep hygiene" and refers to those practices, habits, and environmental factors that are critically important for sound sleep. And most of it is under your control.There are four general areas important to sleep hygiene:Our circadian rhythm, or 24-hour cycleAgingPsychological stress -- those factors can cause difficulty falling asleep and disturb the quality of your sleepCommon social or recreational drugs like nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol.Here are some sleep hygiene tips to help you relax, fall asleep, stay asleep, and get better sleep so that you wake up refreshed and alert.1. Avoid watching TV, eating, and discussing emotional issues in bed. The bed should be used for sleep and sex only. If not, we can associate the bed with other activities and it often becomes difficult to fall asleep.2. Minimize noise, light, and temperature extremes during sleep with ear plugs, window blinds, or an electric blanket or air conditioner. Even the slightest nighttime noises or luminescent lights can disrupt the quality of your sleep. Try to keep your bedroom at a comfortable temperature -- not too hot (above 75 degrees) or too cold (below 54 degrees).3. Try not to drink fluids after 8 p.m. This may reduce awakenings due to urination.4. Avoid naps, but if you do nap, make it no more than about 25 minutes about eight hours after you awake. But if you have problems falling asleep, then no naps for you.5. Do not expose your self to bright light if you need to get up at night. Use a small night-light instead.6. Nicotine is a stimulant and should be avoided particularly near bedtime and upon night awakenings. Having a smoke before bed, although it may feel relaxing, is actually putting a stimulant into your bloodstream.7. Caffeine is also a stimulant and is present in coffee (100-200 mg), soda (50-75 mg), tea (50-75 mg), and various over-the-counter medications. Caffeine should be discontinued at least four to six hours before bedtime. If you consume large amounts of caffeine and you cut your self off too quickly, beware; you may get headaches that could keep you awake.10. Do not exercise vigorously just before bed, if you are the type of person who is aroused by exercise. If this is the case, it may be best to exercise in the morning or afternoon (preferably an aerobic workout, like running or walking).11. Does your pet sleep with you?

We always want this answer??Is there a best time to sleep? There is a saying that sleeping early and waking up early is good for your health.How true is that? Is it alright to sleep late and wake up late?You actually has an amazing biological clock ticking inside your body. It is very precise. It helps to regulate your various body functions including your sleeping time.From 11pm to 3am, most of your blood circulation concentrates in your liver.Your liver gets larger when filled with more blood. This is an important time when your body undergoes detoxification process.Your liver neutralizes and breaks down body toxins accumulated throughout the day.However if you don’t sleep at this time, your liver cannot carry out this detoxification process smoothly.If you sleep at 11pm, you have full 4 hours to detoxify your body.If you sleep at 12am, you have 3 hours.If you sleep at 1am, you have 2 hours.And if you sleep at 2am, you only have 1 hour to detoxify.What if you sleep after 3am? Unfortunately, you won’t have any time to actually detoxify your body. If you continue with this sleeping pattern, these toxins will accumulate in your body over time. You know what happens next.

Hi @LEWard.  Good question.  According to Fitbit, variation is normal. Good would be variation that is mostly in the low range.  Looking at my graphs over the past week, I seem to pop into the high range a few minutes most nights (I guess its a few minutes, the chart is not all that detailed on the time range). I don't think there is any absolute super good or super bad graph, but it can be interesting to think back on what might be going when you have more than normal (for you) high variation in a record. Did you sleep well that night or poorly. Change bed times, eat late, lots of exercise?  The one from last night has a longish period (for me at least) in the high range. Maybe because I had three drinks yesterday?
Thanks for the additional information. Sleep score is now displayed directly on my Ionic (I believe this came with the latest firmware update, though I’m not 100% sure about it):  Since Versa/Versa 2 is quite similar to Ionic software-wise, I thought sleep score may also be displayed on your Versa (or Versa 2). Can you check if it’s the case? It should be found under "Today", when you scroll down to the sleep section.

My point is, i don't know what is supposed to happen when i tap on it. If it is supposed to vibrate, it doesn't. Everytime it is tapped it the lights go back and forth and then a string of them lights up. Now is this IN sleep mode or OUT OF sleep mode, and how can you tell the difference.MaWitters
Did you take a nap in the afternoon? That's what its showing
My device stopped recording sleep stages on November 12!   I’ve turned the device on and off, I’ve verified the settings, but I can’t get any “hours in sleep stages“, what do I need to do?
The Versa and Alta HR use Fitbit's Pure Pulse technology for heart rate monitoring (which is the basis of the new sleep tracking). I have both models and the sleep tracking appears identical.

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
To calculate sleep efficiency:time asleep/time asleep + time restless/awake * 100 ex: a person is recorded to have spent  6 hrs 13 mins asleep and 2 hours and 37 mins restless/awake, which amounts to 8 hours and 50 mins totally in bed. Therefore converting to minutes and inputting numbers into the formula yields 373/530 * 100 = 70% A sleep efficiency of 85% or higher has been determined to equate to a good nights rest. While it is recommended that a person should get 7-9 hours of sleep, quantity does not always equal quality.
WIth my work I occasionally have months where I have to start at 6am like in the summer, this involves being up by 5am, other times of year I start at 8am. The issue is I have got stuck in the habit of waking up between 4.30-5am even at weekends unable to go back to sleep.  In winter I don't start until 8am so really don't need to be up before 6.30 but still I am awake 4.30 am unable to get back to sleep. Any tips for getting over this?
Hi Emamino88, I have quite a few so have been dealing with this for some time. I have always found not to get to anxious about it , its just the way it is. Like some of the other awesome suggestions I read , practice mindfulness ect. I love the tip singing in the head. Next thing is to try out the podcast thing although a little techno challenged at times lol 🙂 I have found that the fitbit is really making me aware of how little sleep I do get so still working on it.Good luck trying the tips and let us know if they work .

I don't think its the same firmware across all devices. I have a Flex and I need to tell it that I'm going to sleep, I got up by tapping it several times.
Sleep is always credited to the day you wake up.Instead of Thursday night's sleep, try thinking of it as Friday morning's sleep (most of it probably actually is on Friday).

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
Good luck with getting a sensible response. My experience with sleep monitoring has been variable at best. Last night I apparently went to sleep at 9:30 PM - which is absolute nonsense. It was probably after midnight before I actually got to sleep. I find that sometimes the connection between the watch and the app can go haywire. Rebooting the watch and the phone seems to clear the glitch. However, it won't get the missing data back... that has disappeared into the ether!

	R.S.
Same kind of thing here. I have a feeling my Charge 4 confuses REM with awake times. There is no way I could be awake that much during the night - ten minutes at a time for example - and not know it. It’s always set on ‘normal’ not ‘sensitive’.

I used to feel very tired if I didn't sleep around 7-8 hours a day, but ever since I started going to the gym, I've actually felt more energized and active during the day and it's easier for me to fall asleep when I go to bed as well. 
 
I remember it used to be very hard for me to wake up in the morning, I probably turned off the alarm around 5 times before I would actually wake up 😂, but those days are gone. 😎

10-10-2020Tachycardia may not have any symptoms, but it's not something to ignore if it persists.  Fitbit makes this easy to monitor.  It is important to know that elevated heart rate can indicate a risk factor for cardiac arrest, stroke, and sudden death, among other things.  The line-in-the-sand is an average resting heart rate of 100 beats per minute.  Since Fitbit users are all about preventing medical intervention, if your resting BPM is of concern to you even at a lower level, re-evaluate your cardio and tighten up on a heart-healthy diet.  It appears cardio exercise (jogging) seems to have nicely lowered your BP.  Focus on consistent cardio over extreme and track your resting BPM.  After a reasonable period of time, see what the numbers tell you to decide where to go from there.  If your BPM continues to rise, there are tried and true medical solutions out there to help with this.  Good luck and stay healthy.
Hi, can someone tell me, why my fitbit did not track 3 hours period in the middle of night? Thank you.
@marcb1time wrote:how do i set my flex to sleep mode, and how do i turn it back to walk mode@marcb1time Sleep mode can be tricky. It needs to be taunt against your skin. Five rapid and firm taps puts it to sleep. It buzzes, then two lights slowly fade to nothing. To check if it's still in sleep mode, tap and see two dancing lights. In the morning, tap five times firmly and it buzzes and a single light shows when tapped. That light is to show the daily goal progress. Any tap when awake is to tell you your progress - one light for each 20% of your goal. When you sync the next time, it ought to log your sleep. click to read about sleep tracking This link is to the Flex area where you will find the manual and related articles - click

Hi Brett. What I have done when I've woken up in the morning and stayed lying down (or forgot to tap my tracker out of sleep mode) was to go into the sleep log on my dashboard after I sync my tracker.  If you hover your mouse by the words "awake/resless" in the upper right corner, you should see an icon of a little bit of paper with a pencil on it.  Clicking on that lets you edit that sleep log entry.  Now you can change the time you actually woke up.  When your done, click the update button and you should be set.  Good luck! Karen

When you link the tracker to his account, it'll be removed from your account. No data will appear on your account from his tracker since it be linked to his own account. You and your husband can use your own tracker and the tracked data by your tracker appears on your account, tracked data by his tracker appear on his account.
If you've tried all of the usual things like pillow, matteress, not being on the computer/smartphone just before bed and no caffine after lunch, then it's possible that there is something going on. If your teeth  have flat spots worn on them it's a sigh that your grinding them. You might be grinding out of habit, a dental condition or because you stop breathing (sleep apnea). A Dentist that does sleep studies can fix any dental problem and hopefully that will controll any grinding or sleep apnea. The Dentist will coordinate with your Medical Doctor if the Dentist finds signs of sleep apnea. If the Dental approach doesn't work to stop the sleep apnea then a medical approach will be needed.
I'm on antidepressants too.  I keep my doctor apprised of any and all "symptoms" in case the meds need adjustment. I suggest that you talk to your doctor about your antidepressant ---- it may be too strong for you and may be causing the oversleeping.  Your doctor may be able to suggest a different antidepressant that won't cause this problem.  Good luck.  GoldaT.
I'm thinking if you only had around 7-8 hrs of sleep, you'd have maybe 7% deep sleep??? @Onightingale02 wrote:I just got the Fitbit Charge 2 for Christmas. For the days I've had it my deep sleep is always at eleven percent or lower. I'm only fifteen and I know deep sleep is vital at my age. I don't understand if this is a sleep problem or if the Fitbit isn't catching when I actually am getting deep sleep. I also realized I'll wake up many, many times in the night. Usually staying awake about seventy to eighty minutes every night. I assume since I've been waking up so often that that's why I'll sleep much longer. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to fix my sleep? I normally go to bed at a decent time (8:00-9:00) Is anyone else like this?
I have a flex. I know how to manually enter it thats no biggie. But I guess theres not a way to let set it up for each day of the week and put the times so it goes on without having to think about it.
I have a similar issue. My data shows I went fell asleep last night at 10:37 PM and woke up at 5:10 AM yet it only shows me as having 5hrs 41 mins of sleep. Digging into the details it shows 0 minutes to fall asleep, 24 times restless, 3 times awake and 52 mins awake / restless. Night before last the data shows me falling asleep at 12:29 AM and waking up at 5:58 AM yet it indicates that I got 5 hrs 6 mins of sleep. The data for this night shows 0 minutes to fall asleep, 10 times restless, 1 time awake and 23 mins awake/restless. Rounding to the hour for mathematic simplicity, last night I should have gotten somewhere north of 6 hours of sleep. Night before last, using the same logic I should have gotten a higher number of sleep hours.  In the Fitbit Sleep Tracker FQA it states that they use this equation to calculate your sleep efficiency: 100 * time asleep / (time asleep + time restless + time awoken during sleep)  This issue I have is that time asleep is calculated in hours/minutes. Times Restless and Time Awake appear to be calculated in number of event anomalies. For example, in the second night I have a total of 11 restless+awake events. However, the last data point is 23 mins awake / restless. Is the calculation: 100* time asleep / (mins awake / restless)? Also how do you see the “time asleep”? The final number shown in the dashboard in the time asleep after the calculation.
No, you are not the only one concerned about REM and Deep Sleep. I check every morning my sleep from the night before. I am concerned about my deep sleep especially since I think it is too low. I drink a lot of coffee and do not go to bed at a certain time. I have just started to stop watching TV right before going to bed, using my mobile phone and eating too late at night. I am obsessed with my REM and deep sleep as well.
Having the same problem the last few nights
Glad to see this topic.
Hi @BeTheDance, That's a great idea. I can see the use of being able to subjectively rate our sleep. Feel free to make an official proposal here, which is the section of this site Fitbit monitors for new ideas.  

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
try resetting your fitbit by pushing in the left button and the right bottom button  at the same time until you see the fitbit logo on the screen, it takes 5 or so seconds for this to happen. I've had the simple sleep display issue and this usually solves it.
The fitbit only records movement (typically arm movement).  How that relates to sleep is based on the assumption you progress through 4 or 5 stages of sleep, and in deep sleep you don't move much.
I've been to sleep clinic twice (first for diagnosis and then to calibrate machine).  I gave copies of my sleep data to the sleep specialist and he kept them in my file.  The sleep data from my FitBit Flex corroborate his results and show a pattern that his results did not/were not able to show.  I would hope that all sleep specialists/doctors take the data seriously.  You can always give them the data and let them decide whether to keep it or not --- hopefully they will keep it in your file.  Best of luck. G.

I just slept with my fitbit flex for the first time last night. When I woke up it was off of my wrist down in the covers....my sleep time is all over the place! Hopefully it will stay on tonight!
Yes, I'm referring to Fitbit, as that's the focus of this site. 🙂 I've used that type of software before with smartphones, but honestly I didn't find much benefit from it. Usually my deep stage is towards the beginning, and REM somewhere in the middle. But I typically don't have either near wake time, so I'm fine the way things are. I do recommend you propose it in the Feature Suggestion part of this site. It's a good idea, and one that may be implemented with trackers that have an alarm already.  

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
Thank you for this. That's very reassuring.
It is my understanding after talking to customer service is that only the Alta HR, Blaze and the Charge 2 will get the new functionality - those of us with other devices (like my Charge HR) won't get the new sleep stages and have only lost functionality like sleep efficiency calculations and the ability to tell exactly how long and when we were awake / restless.
My app started saying 0 sleep score about a week ago, and I'm with you. Bring back the averages!!
I do it exactly that way. Sometimes the next sync it will ask if I forgot to log my sleep, so apparently it didn't work on those occasions.
i was pretty shocked on mine saying i got ten times restless.. O_o
I recently had the same experience:  1hour 2minutes Deep sleep and 30% REM.  Total score "18."  This score is much lower than I have gotten when I had similar Deep Sleep and REM scores ranging from 20% - 24%.  I have to assume the score gets lowered with too much REM sleep.
I hear ya! I am so tired of being tired. Good luck with Italy sleep study. Sent via the Samsung Galaxy S9+, an AT&T 4G LTE smartphone

"Awakened xx times" on your Dashboard is kind of misleading: Fitbit has no way to know whether you were awake or asleep, it merely makes assumptions based on your arm's movements. Likewise, if you see a solid blue area on the graph, it doesn't necessarily mean you were sleeping tight all the time: if you spent one hour with your eyes wide open, but your Fitbit-arm perfectly still against your body, Fitbit would deem you were sleeping. I would say 10-15 "restless" episodes with the sensitive setting is good. If you feel rested in the morning when you wake up and don't fall asleep during the day, you probably had a good sleep, which your normal setting indicates.

I really need to know how the sleep information works... Holla
So I work a long day, and I average between 4.5 - 5 hours of sleep a night. My sleep report tells me I have many restless portions throughout the night, yet my sleep efficiency is 97%. Just a slight bit confusing, thats all.
but it doesn't matter if you wake in the night i do that too on a fairly regular basis, try not to let it bother you then it's not an issue - i just get up take a pee go make a cup of tea read my book for half an hour and then easily go back to sleep - if it doesn't affect your day then all is well
There's an option to manually start sleep mode in the app if you click the sleep tile and the + (top right corner on iOS). I'm not sure if pausing is an option, but you can stop it at any time.You can also edit your sleep times by clicking an entry and (in the app) click the three dots in the top right corner. From the dashboard you can do the same by clicking 'see more' on the sleep tile and clicking the entry you want to edit.

I would also love to learn more about this situation.  If it is a criteria for sleep restoration and a large factor in the sleep score there should be some fitbit info -- beyond a few sentences -- to learn about the science so we can dig deeper.  I find very little scientific evidence on the importance of lowering sleeping heart rate.
Editing and saving works great but I have to do it EVERYDAY now?  Is there a better solution or maybe a fix from Fitbit? This is a little annoying
@Fred99 -- That's interesting.  I think my patterns is similar.  I tend to have 2 or 3 drinks on Fridays and Saturdays and none or one other days of the week. On the two or more drinking nights my SHR is above resting for the first 1/3 of the night or so and mostly below for the rest of the night.  On the one or no drink nights my SHR is mostly below  resting the whole night.

Hi. I am looking to buy a fitbit watch that can wake me up during light sleep, maybe less than an hour before my alarm is set to ring. I wish someone could advise a few models to look into. All of the models I could find have the sleep tracking function, but they don't say whether they can wake you up in this way.
From everything ive read and heard about recent studies. 6 hours of sleep is not enough for anybody
I'm over 70 and am using the sleep monitor to try to increase the length of and quality of sleep. I usually get ~ 6.5 hours per night or at least I try.  I'm also willing to nap during the day to increase total sleep per 24 hrs. I'm also willing to drink too much coffee during the day...which can be an issue. Very interested in the deep sleep time since this is when growth hormone is supposed to be released and it is the most restful sleep. I often have issues of waking up at around 2-3 in the morning and have found that taking one cap of l-theanine (amino acid found in green tea) allows me to sleep later into the morning and indications are that it increases the amount of deep sleep also. I also take a couple of magnesium caps during the day...morning and evening. Using a laptop and dongle...I don't see tabs the avg for the average or typical sleep patterns vs age...where are they?
Same! Mine has outrageously high heart rate, won't track sleep, hardly syncs, gives me over 300 min of activity where it used to measure less than 15 at work. At night it toggles between all these new screens and keeps me awake. A charge that used to last 4-5 days now lasts barely 48 hours. It's  completely unreliable and the data is invalid. Also says I walk 11 floors a day.. on a floor of a dept store. Customer service chat fairly useless. Just like fitbit. I hate this thing now, it was expensive and how ironic is it that they sent pre-order info for new devices at the same time the update screwed up our trackers.
I sync my Charge 2 after I wake up so my sleep tracking stops. Just like @squiter, if I take off my tracker to shower, it's still tracking sleep.
Exactly the same query from me. ‘You did it!’ Did what!?
I have this problem with my new Sense FitBit.  My sleep after getting up briefly during the night is not recorded.  I can't find a "Sleep Sensitivity" setting on Sense!  Ideas, anyone?
@rem810926, just curious if you're a swing shift worker? If it's bad, like, really bad, see your PCP, and request a sleep study. I work over nights, and learned my sleep-wake cycle was bad, like off the charts bad, and I needed more help than exercise and diet could give me.
Yeah I'm in my first week...the first night it seemed like it recorded sleep fine, but on Saturday it only recorded 1 hour 32 minutes in the middle of the night, and Sunday 1 hour and 4 minutes in the morning after my alarm went off but I was still in bed (I like to snooze but fell back asleep).  My sleep setting is on normal and not sensitive, and both were fairly normal sleep nights for me.
wow i wish that i could sleep that long!!! i have trouble sleeping in all the time.
I have Charge 2 plus insomnia too! It's a little bit nebulous, but "restless" means there's some movement, like tossing and turning, but less movement than getting up. How it determines what 'restless' and 'awake' are is somewhat of a mystery. I find that even if I'm awake in bed, if I don't move at all, it won't register as restless unless I move a bit. You may be interested to know that soon there will be an update for the Charge 2 that will increase it's sleep tracking capability, including identifying REM and deep sleep patterns.

I try not to eat anything very high carb during and after dinner, so pasta and ice cream and rice are out. I also take 400mg magnesium right before bed (natural muscle relaxant). And I try to keep my bedroom as dark as humanly possible. A lot of people have had success with white noise, keeping away from computer/tablet monitors at least an hour before sleep, and avoiding alcohol.

So, I have had sleeping problems from around 9 months now, dabbling in sleeping tablets and whatnot, so my gf got me a fitbit for Christmas. I have used it ever since, and it is useful for recording daily steps etc. The main thing I use it for is sleep, and I have found it to be pretty interesting to monitor. However, I will have some periods in the night, where I put the thing on, and it say that I was sleep for lets say 2 hours and 10 minutes out of 2 hours and 20 minutes of being in bed. But at the same time, I personally don't recall falling asleep in that time. Is it possible, that if I am completely still in bed, Fitbit could think that I'm alsleep? Or is that truly when I am asleep, as slight movements should register as 'restlessness'.
What is considered a good night sleep?
From what I've read, our body has natural rhythms that prefer to wake up and go to sleep about the same time every day and night. We don't really have separate biological clocks for weekdays and weekends. A lot of our lifestyles aren't in harmony with that, mine included. If you are trying to switch from getting up at 5AM to getting up at 7AM, I would give it at least a couple of weeks to make the transition. During this period go to bed a couple of hours later, and try not to make up the sleep with naps. I'm usually pro-naps, but if you need to make your wake time later, I think it will work against you, as your body will get more energy from napping and then you'll still wake up at 5. When I do this kind of change, for the 1st week I start to feel a little sleep deprived, but then my  body adjusts and I sleep in later. Consistency is the key. Moving the wake/sleep times around on the weekend or days off will make it harder in my experience. For Grace's situation, I haven't found much that works, other than just not staying up later on the days off. 'Best of luck. I think in your favor, Dave, is that the needed sleep change occurs for a period during the year, and doesn't alternate every week or month. I hear from so many people that stay up later on weekend nights or nights before days off so they can sleep in, but I feel our bodies would prefer consistent sleep times. I think of sleep as my body's "primary job", and try to schedule around that as much as possible. Of course we have other obligations that prevent consistent bedtimes, but I use that as a guide. Best of luck.

@JackP I'm glad I could help you with your analysis. That is a dramatic result. My b-in-law was on Nexium as well, but as his carer I never witnessed the very high pulse rate. He had a very low blood pressure of 95/65 most times and I had to warn his medical staff that's his norm. There is no correlation to BP or pulse according to this link.  He was using Nexium to minimise his chances of aspiration pneumonia because he had a parallel delayed swallowing problem. But I'm sure your GP is monitoring the reaction.. Keep us posted and being a semi public forum (this week) it is always difficult to talk health issues. @JackP wrote:Thank you Colin.  I did as you suggested and it worked great.  Got much more detail.  As you can see the acid reflux event was long and uncomfortable.  What bothers me is that my heart rate was so high for so long and I didn't even realize it.  Thats longer than when I run! Does nothing for sleep of course.  Also I can tune in the time and get even more detail and a better estimated length of event.

While I have loved my Fitbit Surge from day 1, I only yesterday realized how amazingly precise the sleep tracker is.  I noticed it when I took an afternoon nap after having been awake for about 8 hours.  It logged my nap with impressive accuracy--seperately from my overnight rest.  It made me realize that if the sleep tracker were not precise, it would be confused by my relaxing in a recliner or sitting idly reading a book.  It clearly can tell the difference between sleep and being idle.  GREAT job, Fitbit!!

My guess is that your regular medical doctor would be willing to send you for a sleep study based on what you said. Mine wanted me to go for a sleep study initially, but it turned out I have iron deficient anemia, and that's why I was so tired. I know many people who have gone (and wanted to go) for sleep studies and none of them ever said their doctor was reluctant to send them. Any doctor who minimizes a patient's concern or request is not a doctor I would want to see. I don't think your MD would send you to a psychologist for an anxiety test (which I'm not sure even actually exists) just because you're not sleeping well- unless you told him that you thought that was the cause, which you have indicated is not.
I sleep in a pretty quiet, dark and cool environment - so sight, sound and touch are all good, but I am am still looking to improve my sleep - I don't stay asleep throughout the night. How has the peppermint and lavender worked for you?I will look into getting something for that can infuse my room with either of those scents.
Sorry, I can't answer your question, but I am very curious about being connected to portal your doctor uses.  I haven't heard of that before.  I certainly don't want to know any personal information, but curious if you can tell more about it.  I am assuming this is what is often called a "patient portal", and guessing it is a medical group rather than a single doctor, right?  Did they offer the option to connect to Fitbit?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
I went to edit but I can't.  The graph  for estimated oxygen variation changes night to night.  The line for low oxygen seems to move around from one night to the next.  Is this normal
Fitbit Team,Have a great day.I cannot use electronics on the water heating system. The water valve not work with NEST and Honeywell thermostats. I get child at room temperature. I put up the heat. I sleep with only socks. This is not helping. I have a 20 lbs weighted blanket, many times I have the blanket aside, anxiety, restless sleep, etc.Thank you for your time.Charles Allen MartinP.S. Sleep S Med+ kept saying bedroom to hot. It is in the storage room in the box.
Hmm, maybe it's when you're sleeping. I've read that people tend to get the most restful sleep between 10 pm and 6 am. (I try to get to bed by 11:30 and get up at 5:40, but then my body seems to like getting between 5 and 6 hours of sleep.) I do have periods of restlessness, but it's rare that I have more than 10 minutes a night unless it's a weekend, when I tend to sleep more. Unless your job requires you to work odd shifts, you might want to consider changing the times you go to bed and get up.
I'm seeing the same. My avg awake time with stages is an hour. With the old way, it was 15-30 minutes.  Not really a problem, I just need to understand what now constitutes a good or bad night.  But annoying that it makes it impossible to compare with old data, and that I have to change my sleep goal..
I am wondering if anyone else has the same issue.  I am a natural night-owl ever since I was a child.  My natural sleep cycle is go to bed between 6-9am and wake up after 3pm.  When you talk to friends about this, they insist you must wake up early and go to bed around 10-12pm. I tried for years doing a 9-5 job but despite the routine it never felt right.  I'm wondering whether there are a few people like me who are not meant to go to bed at the conventional time, and have evolved to be the nightwatchmen.  Anyone else in the same boat?
Hi, thanks for your input. I absolutely agree that the breakdown of REM, Deep, Light sleep etc is interesting but the point that I was trying to make is that the actual score doesn't seem to match up the reality of the quality and effectiveness of sleep and is therefore more or less meaningless. I have also never read anything that validates the idea that sleeping more than 8 hours helps weight loss sadly. That would be brilliant! I could stay in bed all day long and stop being such a big fat lump!
I see that more people need to ask for sleep stages on Surge be change to Rem,Deep, Light,And awake. So I am asking is there Fitbiters that would like this change? Thank you
Hi everyone, Was interested in seeing the new sleep breakdown on REM etc. Do you need to have a separate device, or rather a new one, for this?  I have a Surge that I got for Christmas last year. It does the usual sleep analysis but without this new extensive material. Can I set up my Surge for the new sleep measures?  Do I have to change the Fitbit app or some such? Thanks, Ken H

Lack of sleep is the biggest problem because it is very detrimental to your health
yes i agree that the tech support for fitbit isnt the best, several times i have emailed about the sleep records myself and resieved only answers to questions that i hadnt asked.
I do not wear it that snug. Moves about 1-1.5 in on wrist.
Hello! Perhaps in all of you you moved a lot, I sometimes have the same thing. Either there is a problem with the settings as it catches any change.
What health insurance do you have Pingu?
First of all, sleeping is so important! Sleeping helps you feel better when your not feeling well your sad.. So as you get older (no offense to anyone) it's harder to sleep. 😮 so some people take pills to help them sleep but even when your young it's hard to sleep. SO!! My mom uses a natural oil called "Peace And Calming" if you would like to look this up the organization is called " Young Living " the oil helps you relax, and calm yourself down until you fall asleep. I highly recommend Young Living to you! If you have any questions about this oil or organization comment down below thank you.

For some time now I have been annoyed by finding incomplete or missing sleep data when I wake up in the morning. I finally found a solution to this, at least with the Charge 4. If your sleep data are incomplete in your app (e.g. it suddenly stops displaying data half-way through the night), you can click on the day in question under Sleep, touch the little drop-down menu in the upper right corner, and choose Edit Log. Then manually enter your actual wakeup time and Save.I did this and suddenly the missing data appeared. The device had recorded it but, for some reason, wouldn't display it in the app. You can use the same trick if the app shows no data at all. Just create a new log with the time you fell asleep (if not sure, estimate it) and the time you woke up. The Fitbit app will then show whatever data is has for that time period.I have done this with missing sleep data going back to last November and have managed to recover data for every night I thought I had missed. You can also do this on the web site, and more easily than you can with the app.Hope this helps someone. It solved a major annoyance for me.
My deep sleep is more continuous, and even when I get the same amount of total sleep I feel more rested.
That all said keep trying to I iron. Rain waves from your hand.
This is interesting. I have noticed in the past few days that something seems different with my sleep tracking. I have the ultra. I've used the same device every night for years. My sleep is rock solid consistent. Starting maybe 3 nights ago I notice it suddenly says I am restless A LOT more than usual. I am a good sleeper and average something like 96% sleep with one 'awake' and maybe 7 'restless' a night. As of a few nights ago I am now in the 80s% and my 'awake' is crazy, like awake 17 times and restless 33. I know this isn't right. Given that the ultra and the one are basically the same device, I wonder if they aren't making changes to the sleep log.
I find meditating just before bed actually doesn’t help, I’ll meditate and usually fall asleep and then wake up again and not be able to fall asleep again! Reading a book will usually send me off to the land of nod quite quickly. My difficulty is staying asleep, I’ll usually wake up around 2am (usually asleep at 1030) and be restless for a while and sometimes even need to go and sleep in spare room or the sofa to get back to sleep again. I dream of getting an uninterrupted nights sleep! Any tips for this welcome.
@n8vz, while I don't remember having a scary dream in, geez, decades, your observed correlation between orange spikes and REM sleep applies to my graphs as well.  Too bad Fitbit doesn't superimpose the O2 Variation Graph on the sleep stages graph.
Between the hours of 3.00 am and 3.45 am, my fitbit recorded that I did nearly 4000 steps. I am aware I woke to go to the toilet at least three times but that would only account for 100 steps or so. Data has also recorded the steps as 'intense' exercise (?!) I did have a disturbed sleep with my sleep tracker showing I was awake for around 12 mins around the above time. My phone also shows I sent a text around that time. I am however very confused.  Up until last night, data during the night has been very accurate. Any explanations are welcomed!
If the fitbit manufacturers are reading this...would you care to invest in me, your customer, and to give me another fitbit Charge? I liked it a lot and it was a Christmas gift from a concerrned spouse (for my  health).
When I wake up, and enter 'awake now' in the fitbit app, I always get the response that ''the server didn't authorise to enter this sleep" (de server gaf geen toestemming die slaap in te voeren).And when I check the recorded sleep, it's always wrong and it gives me a poor score!It only gives me the start of my sleep a few hours later than when I went to bed, and stops when I go to the bathroom for just 2 minutes. Afterwards it says that it did'nt get enough hours of sleep to give me a correct analysis!What should I do??
The big question is how are you feeling, @SBAsMiMi ?  Do you wake up tired? Do you snore? The sleep reports are meant to offer guidance. You may want to mention the reports to your doctor, especially since you have a family history of sleep apnea.
I have Premium also, try hitting the open button and see if it ask you for an update
Thanks for your feedback. I will check it out.
I cannot figure out how to make this change. When I find instructions, I don't see the same options.
There's an ongoing problem with sleep stages that's affecting many Alta HR users. Keep an eye on this thread that has the latest updates from the moderators: https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Alta-HR/9-3-Received-Classic-Sleep-rather-than-Sleep-Stages/td-p/217...
Jesus, don't spread fear. One or two blips here and there can happen. Your chart vs OP is vastly different. Were you just pandering for extra views? Wine clogs my sinuses and I snore like a monster after a glass, often with the same peaks as OP. Does OP have an intermittent something they are being exposed to? Is the cat sleeping on their face once in a while? It's like telling a kid who says they feel funny (hyper) sometimes after eating sugar that they must be diabetic because sugar throws you into a tizzy. Get a hold of yourself, and if nothing else have the decency to post a caveat that you are not an expert. I'm sorry you have sleep apnea but that does not make you an expert.
I usually check my sleep log in the morning, and this morning, however many times i tried restarting app and even Blaze, it won't show any log. When I tried to log sleep manually, it gave me window with "this log already exists" and didn't show anything anyway. Is it only me or some major bug?P.S. on normal PC dashboard I can't even open sleep board. It says error.Thank you for help!
@notfit-  I always have a radio playing at night and it doesn't seem to affect my sleep pattern at all. Welcome to the forums.

@Coutin-Eliyahu wrote:@RachelMary:There are supplements you could try. The most well known (perhaps most "popular") is melatonin. I use it and one tablet (500mcg - 500 micrograms) usually knocks me out. Also calcium supplements are known to enhance sleep. I'm taking "Tums" as a calcium supplement (it's really just a calcium tablet, since calcium carbonate is also an ant-acid). One thing that really made me want to reply to this post is the fact that I also started taking higher doses of vitamin D supplements. I think this is really helping me to re-establish a circadian rythm (that's just fancytalk for "regular sleeping pattern"). I am wondering if a lot of us urbanized folks are suffering from vitamin D deficiancy and that's what's causing a lot of these sleep disorders. Anyhow, the vitamin D really seems to be making my sleep more fulfilling. I still sleep only a few hours, but I wake up more easily, am more rested all day through, and my sleep seems less fitful. At least my Fitbit seems to think so. Less restlessness. Try vitamin D supplements. Increase the dose gradually every day, and monitor your Fitbit's sleep analysis. See if your restlessness goes down and see if you start feeling better. When you reach the level of sleep regularity that you're comfortable with, start tapering off the vitamin D. See how much you can reduce the dose before your sleep begins to become restless again. Hope this helped. Good luck with it. B"H. PS: here's a link to the Google results on vitamin D and sleep:Google: sleep+vitamin+dThanks for the tips! I have already been taking a combined calcium + vitamin D supplement for the past couple of years, maybe I have to increase my intake of that. I know I am probably vitamin D deficient anyway because where I live, during the winter it is only light for about 6 or 7 hours per day during the winter, and being a student I'm inside most of the day and I have a history of major depression that does get worse during the winter. Maybe I need to give the melatonin a try, I haven't considered that much before. Thanks for the reccomendations!
I wore mine a couple of times, but generally I don't. I think it's good to take a break from wearing the band.
I can’t get the sleep time on my Fitbit Please help
If it is available, for Premium it is under Restoration (below the chart of Sleeping HR). However, even for (many or all?) of those of us that had it visible, it has disappeared again. So you may not find it there. In my case I had it for a couple weeks both without and with Premium, but it is gone now.

@philchenevert I didn't know you were using a CPAP machine at night. Hope you're better now! It' great to know that this information was helpful, I'm sure your doctor has mentioned Fitbit products to other patients to have those stats and have a better idea how they are improving their sleep. I also visited a pulmonary specialist but for different reasons but it can be a little bit stressing keep track of everything by your own. Using this charts really helps.

Considering how crucial a smart alarm is to the sleep tracking function, the feature will inevitably be incorporated into the app. If enough of U.S. request the feature through the web site, we can make it happen! Post away my friends!
Over the last two weeks my sleep restlessness has changed drastically.… From 4 to 5 times to not to 19 or 20. This has continued for two weeks.  SHould I be concerned? What is normal on the sleep app for restlessness?
Hi @ChrisO_O, If it were my father, I wouldn't rely on a Fitbit or any other fitness tracker. They're not rated as medical equipment, and I'd hate for you to be lulled into a false sense of security. All that said, there are stories of people catching conditions for diagnosis with their Fitbits. It's just not designed for that purpose. Some help, huh? 🙂

Work out...eat... sleep...repeat!Dave | California
From fitbit. "How does my tracker automatically detect sleep?All of our wrist-based trackers automatically detect your sleep, meaning you just need to wear your tracker to bed. After you sync your tracker in the morning you'll see your sleep information on your dashboard. To track sleep with Fitbit One, see How do I put my tracker in sleep mode?Autodetection is based on your movement. When you haven’t moved for about an hour, your tracker assumes that you’re asleep. Additional data—such as the length of time your movements are indicative of sleep behavior (such as rolling over, etc.)—help confirm that you’re asleep. Morning movement tells your tracker that you’re awake. If you’re not moving but not asleep for long periods of time it’s possible for your tracker to falsely record sleep, in which case you can delete the sleep log from your history.If you track sleep with Alta HR, Blaze, or Charge 2, Fitbit uses a combination of your movement and heart rate patterns to estimate your sleep stages. For more information, see What should I know about sleep stages?"

It doesn't seem to be accurate for me. I spend most of my nights awake and fitbit will say awake (0), restless (3x). I'm pretty disappointed with the sleep mode.
I am  having the same issue did you find a resolution? Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn.

Thanks! This works, and I went back and fixed the last 6 days.  The "awake" times are captured but not calculated.
I would try to set your sleep monitor settings to "sensitive" instead of "normal" and see if that seems to be more accurate. Hope this helps!

It’s a very new feature, the help article is less than one month old. Just be patient, you will eventually get it. I remember the same happened with sleep score last summer: other peope got it several weeks before me, but in the end, I also got it. If that really bothers you, try contacting Fitbit support and ask them.

@eezeepee Mine used to consistently give accurate start and stop times, but it no longer does (as of approximately December).  I have been thinking that perhaps an update to the app messed things up, but maybe it is instead related to the age of the device.  I believe that the youtuber you mentioned evaluates brand-new devices, but I may be wrong about that.  The specific issue is that part of the sleep is cut off or omitted.  I'm not questioning the accuracy of the data that actually is there initially or the "new" data that shows up after the record is deleted and a new record put in with correct times.  However, I will note that sometimes there are some changes to the "architecture" of the sleep when I do this.  For example, as noted below, some awake time was changed to REM and some light sleep was changed to deep sleep.  OriginalWhat shows up when correct times are entered.
so I've only had my charge hr for 3 nights now...first 2 nights were fine, 7 ish hours (which is correct as I also use "sleep as android")but upon waking I checked last nights data and it says I only slept for 3hrs... o.O?what gives? I definitely went to bed at 9:30 ish and woke up at 5:30 ishideas? help?
What Fitbit model do you have? For how long have you been wearing it?

@Midico: some newer CPAP machines (e.g. Resmed Airsense 10) appear to store sleep data on an SD card and let the sleeper analyze it via a free desktop software. Check this other post by @SunsetRunner (who hopefully can chime in and comment) for more information if you are interested.

@GeorgyGirl66  Do you have a screenshot of your sleep stage breakdown?
This is impossible to align exactly because fitbit refuses to put a proper x-axis on these graphs, and my psg doesn't display data very intelligently either, but you can get the idea.
Because they took all of the good parts away and getting less features for the money. As a 7 year Fitbit owner I am ready to go for another brand that cares for its watch owners. I am selling my 2 Versa Lites.
Definately not!
My sleep recorded for a while when I got my versa 2.  Then it stopped.  Occasionally it records.  Maybe 1 day out of the month.  I don’t know what to do. 😞
Sorry to disappoint you but naturally it does not get it right quite often. It varies a lot. Of course I am still impressed with the algorithm they wrte to try and guess when you fall asleep but it would not be a bad idea if it had a button/manual overrride that you press when you go to bed (like the FitBit One).  If you stay still watching a film at the end of the day the Surge sometimes thinks it is the beginning of your sleep. This error  can be compound by it missing you climbing a floor when you go upstairs to bed. I find that the Surge's altimeter is not as accurate as my old FitBit One's which is a pity. It misses the floor counts quite often while the FitBit On was almost spot on. Having said all of this I am quite happy with the Surge and its GPS capabilities.
Yeah I really liked the old sleep data too. Very informative and factual, and you could see your patterns over time. The new score method turned me off sufficiently to stop wearing my FitBit entirely.   I think FitBit has jumped the shark with this update.
Hey @Bartfliet thank you for sharing the way you're using to getting to sleep. Yeah, it's not so crazy I read a study published in March 2017, where they found that pink noise helped adults get deeper sleep and improve memory since it reduces brain waves, which increases stable sleep. 😁👍
 
I tried to do so, but for some reason it didn't work for me. 🤔

Hi Dominique, thanks for replying.  I could delete the sleep tab but it's a real pity as I enjoyed looking at my sleep stats on an hours and stages basis. I never looked at the benchmark tab and I rarely log onto a larger device/browser - I'm very much an app based human!  Thanks for your suggestion though. I'm afraid I will probably just switch to another device once this one is due for renewal. Shame.
I want to annotate my sleep history with some context.  Such as, had 1 too many margaritas, or sleep in guest room, or wife couldn't sleep through the night, etc.  Is there any place to mark the sleep history?  It would help a lot tracking patterns.
I definitely do try to fight it! Sometimes I'll encourage the thoughts, as I'll keep thinking about sleeping, so I try to distract my self by going off on a mind tangent!
I used to have the same problem, but I found that avoiding technology for half an hour before I went to bed and not going to bed until I was barely able to keep my eyes open, then putting the radio on to my favourite channel and reading a magasine or book until I was on the verge of falling asleep really helped me. Recently my hubby told me about the "night light" thingy on Windows 10 where it dulls your screen at a certain time (mine is set to 7.30pm to 7am but you need to set yours to what works for you) has helped me too. Basically if, like me, you're using technology right up until you go to bed, your brain is functioning and not relaxing so it's stopping you from falling asleep. I've also set the reminder on my Fitbit to tell me when I should start getting ready for bed.  It takes a few days and a different night time routine, but small changes make big differences!

I agree with previous note. It actually took me a while to locate the place to edit it. I think I ended up looking up a u tube video 🙂  It IS there I promise.
Dear FitBit,Please release your academically tested evidence based research that supports your hypotheses relating to Sleep Score.If rigorously tested evidence based research does not exist:-please allow users (who paid a lot for their watches) to turn off this meaningless ‘feature’. -please confess that Sleep Score is nothing more than a poorly designed mathematical formula, with the output designed to encourage the purchase of FitBit Premium. I trust the research will be rapidly provided since surely it exists, and a tech company would never rely on gimmicks and questionable marketing to enhance profits.
@tkcornbred Thanks for sharing the screenshots, that's super helpful!
 
Can you confirm that your online Dashboard at Fitbit.com is also showing the gap that you've described in the app? If not, I recommend logging out of the app and logging back in and checking back into that specific sleep record. Logging out and logging back in should refresh the sleep record. Let me know what you find out.

I currently have an old HR Charge still working which, apparently will not do the sleep score so mine is now zero, every time. I can no longer even see my average sleep time for the week. Why would it be a feature for a device that doesn't work with it? One size doesn't "fit" all, "Fit"bit.
@lynnbaum  Read this article about sleep - click I'm not sure how dreams would be seen by the tracker. Maybe it causes more arm movements which translates into steps. Welcome to the forums.

This is really interesting.  My background is I am awaiting for a second opinion at Stanford soon.  I have an appt for the PSG and hopefully a MSLT, but only if they deem needed. Where I live I had one done and yes it has shown issues, but nothing that they can apparently help me with except medication.  Problem is, is I'm having problems with the meds and the sleep doc here in town is the only one and you cannot get in to see him.  My own doc doesn't understand other medications for this problem, so she sent me to Stanford for help.  I also have other issue's that have made me wonder if I also have an Autoimmune disorder so I am trying to get help with that too while I'm there.. Who know's maybe their connected.Ok, so anyway, I just got a fitbit Charge2.  I have to admit it's quite interesting watching my sleep patterns everynight.  So far I have done 3 nights  First 2 I was shocked when it said I was only getting 2 hours and 19 mins of sleep that night!  Next night it was 2 hours and 17 mins, and last night was much better.... 4 hours and some mins... can't remember.  I am shocked.  really shocked.  I'm supposed to be keeping a log anyway to bring in right before I go to my appt so this is great as I can download all of this info.Thanks.  Would love to see more peoples results..
Sounds like your experience is an intermittent one and different to mine. My wife has an older Charge 2 which she says never tracks her sleep for longer than 1 or 2 hours. I gave her my Charge 3 to try for a night and it logged her 1 hour of sleep, out of a real 7 hours or so. She is a restless sleeper and we now suspect a sleep disorder. Going to see a sleep clinic for their opinion next week.
Thank you so much for your very helpful reply. I've just checked and it has increased.Thanks again.
My biggest problem is that i work as an overnight caretaker from 8:30 PM to 7:00 AM. Do not even try to go to sleep anymore when i get home. Usually try to get a little sleep if not rest in the afternoon. So maybe an hour then. At night only fall asleep for 30 - 45 minutes at a time maybe twice. So my average sleep in about 4 hours, (not averaging in my days off). The tv, ie, white noise is mandatory to falling asleep as is turning off the ringers after 3 PM.I did the medication route years ago before this job and i believe it made things worse. Now i take nothing and feel much better even if i get no actual sleep in the afternoon.MaWitters
Can anybody share some insight into narcolepsy type 1? I'm epileptic and just recently my consultant wants me to go for sleep test to register my sleeping patterns as he's concerned there's more to my generalised epilepsy. If I share my sleep.log from fitbit can anyone tell me what their opinions are?  Thanks
Do any of you use apps becides the fitbit app to track your sleep? If so, what apps do you use, and how well does the data from each app match up? I've been using another app for a while, simply because before I got my fibit I wanted to track my sleep. Now that I've got my fitbit, I've been using them both to track sleep and see how each set of data compares in the morning. I think it's interesting to see the differences and similarities.
So my graph in the dashboard shows intense calorie burn at night - higher than my daytime Zumba class. Any ideas why?  See here, same day:  Here on the calorie view this peak shows!?   Thanks
I slept 60 % efficiency last night and have been in the 60s for the past week.  All I know is that I wake up frequently and roll over.
When it comes to sleep, like most things in life, there is no magic bullet or medicine. Sleep aids are actually not meant for long-term use. For more information, please check this website. 
Can anyone share their experiences about how to deal with sleep disorders? 
 
Moderator Edit: Formatting
My sleep log was split in two blocs.
I tried modifying the earliest log to extend it to the time wake-up time, but it told me it "Can't save log. A sleep log already exists in this time period."
So I deleted the latest log, and re-tried to modify the earliest log, but the same message came back, so I just lost the latest sleep log.
Then I tried deleting the the other log so i could add a brand new one, and same message....so i lost the log of my whole night.
Please help!
Can I retrieve deleted sleep logs?
Or is there a way the app (and website) stop thinking a log still exists once it's deleted?

The quality and shape of your pillow also has a lot to do with the quality of your sleep.  If it doesn't support your neck the right way, you will get all bent out of position and your airway will not be wide open and you just won't get as good a night's sleep.  If you have a clock near your bed, position it so that you cannot see it while you are in bed as watching the time tick by actually causes a great deal of stress and prevents you from falling asleep.  The regular use of sleeping pills will actually decrease the quality of your sleep overall as they are not meant to be used all the time and will quickly leave you feeling strung out. If you have done all these things, it may be time to talk to your doctor and to have a proper sleep study done.  You may have restless leg syndrome or some other medical condition that keeps you from getting proper sleep.  Your fitbit only monitors movement; it doesn't monitor what's going on in your brain.  A full sleep study monitors both and will help target treatment on the correct part of the body.  Maybe you need a mild muscle relaxant instead of sleeping meds? If it makes you feel any better, my bit tells me I have a sleep efficiency upwards of 95%... of the whole 4 hours of sleep I get a day.  And that's with sleeping medications.  I'm just not a squirmer so my bit thinks I'm sleeping soundly.  When I had a full sleep study done, almost none of that was proper sleep.  I may be unconscious, but I'm not in restorative sleep and I too feel awful most of the day and I fall asleep at my desk.  When the doctor got results he was shocked I managed to make it to the appointment, never mind keep a full time job.  The number your fitbit spits out at you is not everything so don't get too hung up on it.

I have found that by putting my Fitbit Charge 2 on my ankle when I go to bed, it gives a much better read of my actual sleep.  If left on my wrist, it shows me awake just because I moved my arm.  (I evidently move my arms a lot during my sleep.)  On my ankle I do not have that problem.  It gives me very accurate readings if I actually get up or are just a bit restless.  Pat Mc.
Have you compared your sleep stages with the benchmark that's shown on the app? Sounds like you get more deep sleep than I do and I'm well within benchmark normally. I have given myself a device curfew, no phone after 7pm, and am strict with bed times and waking up times as the routine really benefits me. Also I have my nighttime routine of yoga, meditation, epsom salts bath & reading.

Hello @MoonstoneWolfMy mom got a Fitbit Alta and we're testing the Sleep sensitivity settings and what's better for her. Last night she got a graph which was quite similar to yours and we were testing the "sensitive" setting. You can check if that's the same for you by clicking here: https://www.fitbit.com/settings/profilescroll down the page till you find "Sleep sensitivity" and try to set it as "Normal". From what I understood, the sensitive mode will easily pick up every little movement as if you were restless/awake and I am inclined to believe that in case of my mom, even when she snores 😛With the "Normal" setting, her graph seemed to be more accurate. I'm not sure if this might be your issue, try to change your setting and see what works better for you!

It works great I had a Jawbone UP3 before buying my Fitbit Charge 2. I'm shocked my new band doesn't do these simple things. The Jawbone app doesn't connect to the Fitbit. 😯
I am having difficulty putting my FB in/out of sleep mode, too.  I tap it twice; slap it twice; pound it twice; everything but throw it against the wall twice!  What's the trick?  Thanks!
Hi, @mis-fit-bit! That's definitely frustrating. Are you getting other readings (mostly heart rate) at night? If so, I'd suggest plugging in the sleep time manually for a few nights and see if that kicks off the tracking.

After about a week of tracking my sleep stages REM, Deep, lite, etc. my Fitbit is just giving me simplified readings.  I've done everything that has been suggested and it is still now working.  Should I return it?
@Shepherd123 Me too! i had a good momentum going then this covid/stay at home orders happened and now the protests - seems workload and living in the center of protests are giving me stress/anxiety.  Seem to not be able to get more than 4 hours of sleep a night, which is impacting my energy level which is impacting my step count 😒It's almost 2am where i am and my alarm is going to go off in 3.5 hours... I need to figure something out soon.   What's causing your sleeplessness issue?  is it work or life stress?
I experienced the same last night.  I always have my sleep tracked and last night was the first time EVER that it didn’t track sleep.  I sent an email to Fitbit customer support for their advice.
I have used the O Ring thing and it has worked great so far. Shame that wehave to go to these lengths!
Hi I have Fitbit charge 2 and I don't want sleep so I charge it every night and it doesn't log sleep
The sleep feature confuses me ......I had it set normal for a few days and it showed my sleep efficiency in the high 90s.  Now I really didnot believe that as most nights I sleep poorly and am tired from the moment I get out of bed.  Then when i set it to the sensitive mode it then shows me at 60%.  More believable to me but it shows alot of awake time that I don't remember.  I asume it it tracking the increase in movement during less restful sleep?
good question, mine is showing restless alot.. and i am always exhausted lol, but still, i wonder how accurate it is, and how it figures this
@joonkim305 wrote:Hi,  My fitbit tracker consistently shows that I do only light sleep after 6am, does that mean I should start waking up at 6 am? I usually wake up around 8 am and sleep about 6 to 7 hours a day, so if I start waking up early it will cut my overall sleep really short. Thanks! Hi @joonkim305, That doesn't sound out of the realm of normal from my (limited) experience. I find the cycles for a night are often Deep, then REM, then Light. As to your question, it would be worth your time to try waking up earlier for a week, and see what your results are. For me, Light sleep is pretty easy to come by. When I increase sleep, I'm looking for more Deep or REM. The best thing to go by is how you feel on waking up. If you feel rested, you may not need to .make any adjustments at all.

Last night my heart rate while I was sleeping suddenly dipped to 51bpm and then went up to 66  I usually resting heartrate is 73 Is this normal?  I'm 29 years old
I don't know about journaling before bed.  Reading novels breaks through the self-critical, problem-solving monologue that seems to occupy a large part of my brain during the day and often follows me into sleep. But, I WOULD LIKE A SLEEP JOURNAL FEATURE!  I was surprised to read that there used to be one. Is the journal now included with the Premium subscription?
Maybe try to tough it out and do your homework after school instead of the nap. Then when you get home from soccer practice hot relaxing shower and then you can get to sleep earlier.
I am pretty sure I do not sleep walk. Last night I got up once around 6 am to go to the bathroom. The number of steps for the round trip is about 22, but the fitbit seems to have recorded twice that. And there are several other times in the night where it records 10 or fewer steps. My sleep sensitivity is set to normal and I know I put it in sleep mode before bed and took it out this morning. . I feel like I slept pretty well otherwise. Is the fitbit mistaking movement in bed for steps?
My Charge 2 that I purchased back in 2017 that worked fine recording my Sleep Score as well as graphing deep, restless sleep and periods of wakefulness ... STOPPED recording my SLEEP SCORE as of 2020/11/07 cause unknown.  After resetting my FitBit Charge 2 yesterday, still no Sleep Score from last night.  However, in the Sleep Goals Settings I see that I had the Sleep Sensitivity set to "Sensitive" so perhaps changing it back to "Normal" may resurrect the SLEEP SCORE for tonight.
Which Fitbit model do you have?

Before posting, re-read to see if it would make sense to someone else not looking at your Fitbit or phone.
gmc505 found his mistake... the light comes on when SCREEN WAKE is set to ON.
Looking to find a white paper/published paper/blog post about the HRV or ECG detection/algorithm to see if it has been validated against a ground truth device. Specifically, HRV during sleep. I've found multiple sleep-stage and HR validation papers, but none on HRV for any Fitbit band. Has this been validated?
Same for me. #update: changing my Fitbit did not fix such issue. Therefore it has to be a firmware issue.
Not only caffeine but some analysis of correlation (if any) between caffeine and sleep!

I do not have facebook, otherwise I would.
I alos had that message a couple of time but most of the time it seems to represents a good picture of the sleep pattern.
@alexthecat , thank you for your response.  I'll definitely checkout the Relax from Head to Toe meditation 😍
@Roessie  I'm new here, too, but I remember reading that fitbit uses your body mass index in an algorithim to calculate steps while you sleep.  Hope this is helpful.  Wish I could point you to what I read...
@jcahaHow are you viewing your sleep log? Generally anything on the computer's dashboard shows more than what is on the mobile device. Is this the case with you? Welcome to the forums.
